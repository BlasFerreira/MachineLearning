  
Bruno Giussani We are at the end
of day six of the war in Ukraine

  
or more correctly
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
launched on February 
by President Vladimir Putin

  
We are all shocked
and saddened by the events

  
and by the human suffering
they are causing

  
And as we speak really

  
a Russian military convoy
is headed towards Kyiv

  
other Ukrainian cities
are being bombarded

  
half a million Ukrainians have already
fled to neighboring countries

  
and much more

  
It's still early days

  
and it's difficult to predict
how the situation will evolve

  
even just in the next few hours

  
But this is a war that should concern
everyone everywhere

  
And so today in this TED
Membership conversation

  
we want to try to give it
a broader context with our guest

  
historian and author Yuval Noah Harari

  
Yuval welcome

  
Yuval Noah Harari Hello

  
Thank you for inviting me

  
BG I want to start from Ukraine itself
and its  million people

  
and its particular place
between the East and the West

  
What do we need to know about Ukraine

  
to understand this war
and what's at stake

  
YNH The most crucial thing to know
is that Ukrainians are not Russians

  
and that Ukraine is an ancient
independent nation

  
Ukraine has a history
of more than a thousand years

  
Kyiv was a major metropolis
and cultural center

  
when Moscow was not even a village

  
For most of these thousand years
Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow

  
They were not part
of the same political entity

  
For centuries Kyiv was looking westwards

  
and was a part of a union
with Lithuania and Poland

  
until it was eventually conquered
and absorbed by the Russian Empire

  
by the czarist empire

  
But even after that

  
Ukrainians remained
a separate people to a large extent

  
and it's important to know that

  
because this is really
what is at stake in this war

  
The key issue of the war

  
at least for President Putin

  
is whether Ukraine
is an independent nation

  
whether it is a nation at all

  
He has this fantasy
that Ukraine isn't a nation

  
that Ukraine is just a part of Russia

  
that Ukrainians are Russians

  
In his fantasy

  
Ukrainians are Russians that want
to be back in the fold of Mother Russia

  
and that the only ones preventing it
is a very small gang at the top

  
which he portrays as Nazis

  
even if the president is Jewish;
but OK a Nazi Jew

  
And his belief was at least

  
that he just needs to invade

  
Zelenskyy will flee

  
the government will collapse

  
the army would lay down its arms

  
and the Ukrainian people
would welcome the Russian liberators

  
throwing flowers on them

  
And this fantasy
has been shattered already

  
Zelenskyy hasn’t fled

  
the Ukrainian army is fighting

  
And the Ukrainian people is not throwing
flowers on the Russian tanks

  
it's throwing Molotov cocktails

  
BG So let's unpack that

  
and maybe take the different
pieces one way one

  
So Ukraine has a long history
of being dominated and occupied

  
You mentioned the czar
but also the Soviet Union

  
Hitler's armies

  
It also has a long history of mistrust
of authority and of resistance

  
which goes some way to explain
the current strong resistance

  
that the Russians are encountering

  
Anne Applebaum the journalist
even suggests that this mistrust

  
this resistance to authority

  
is the very essence
of Ukraineness do you agree

  
YNH We did see in the last  years
Ukrainians twice rising in revolt

  
when there was a danger

  
of an authoritarian regime
being established 

  
once in  once in 

  
And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago

  
what really struck me
was this very strong feeling

  
of the desire for independence
and for democracy

  
And I remember walking around this museum

  
of the Revolution of 

  
and seeing these images
like these two elderly women

  
who were bringing sandwiches
to the demonstrators

  
to the fighters

  
They couldn’t throw stones
and they couldn’t do anything else

  
so they prepared sandwiches

  
and brought this huge tray
full of sandwiches

  
to the demonstrators

  
And this yes this is the kind of spirit

  
that inspires not just the Ukrainians

  
but everybody who is now watching
what is happening there

  
BG Help me understand
the actual nature of the threat here

  
in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine

  
So in your last book
when you write about Russia

  
you describe the Russian model as
“not a coherent political ideology

  
but rather a sort of practice
of monopolizing power and wealth

  
by a small group at the top"

  
But then in his actions against Ukraine

  
Putin in the last few weeks seems to move
very much by an ideology

  
an ideology of empire
of denial of Ukraine's right to exist

  
as you mention

  
What has changed in the four years
since you wrote that book

  
YNH The imperial dream was always there

  
but you know empires
are often the creation

  
of a very small gang of people at the top

  
I don’t think the Russian people
[are] interested in this war

  
I don't think that the Russian people
want to conquer Ukraine

  
or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv

  
It's all coming from the top

  
So there is no change there

  
I mean when you look at the Soviet Union

  
you can say that there was
this mass ideology

  
which was shared by a large proportion
or some proportion of the population

  
You don't see this now

  
You know Russia is a very rich country

  
rich in resources

  
but most people are very poor

  
Their standard of living is very very low

  
because all the wealth and power
is kind of sucked

  
by the people at the top

  
and very little is left
for everybody else

  
So I don't think it's a society

  
where the masses are part
of this kind of ideological project

  
They're being ruled from the top

  
And you have this classic
imperial situation

  
when the emperor

  
which controls the largest
country in the world

  
feels that "Hey this is not enough

  
I need more"

  
And sends his army to capture

  
to extend the empire

  
BG I said at the beginning

  
that it's difficult of course
to make predictions

  
But yesterday you published
an article in "The Guardian"

  
titled “Why Putin
has already lost this war”

  
Please explain

  
YNH Well one thing should be very clear

  
I don't mean to say

  
that he's going to suffer
an immediate military defeat

  
He definitely has the military
power to conquer Kyiv

  
and perhaps the whole of Ukraine

  
Unfortunately we might see this

  
But his longterm goal

  
the whole rationale of the war

  
is to deny the existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
and to absorb it into Russia

  
And to do that it's not enough
to conquer Ukraine

  
You also need to hold it

  
And it's all based
on this fantasy on this gamble

  
that most of the population
in Ukraine would agree to this

  
would even welcome this

  
And we already know that it's not true

  
That the Ukrainians
are a very real nation;

  
they are fiercely independent;

  
they don’t want to be part of Russia;

  
they will fight like hell

  
And in the longrun again
you can conquer a country

  
But as the Russians learned
in Afghanistan

  
as the Americans learned
also in Afghanistan also in Iraq

  
it's much harder to hold a country

  
And again the big question mark
before the war was always this

  
Before the war started
many things were already known

  
Everybody knew that the Russian army
is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army

  
Everybody knew that NATO will not send
armed forces into Ukraine

  
troops into Ukraine

  
Everybody knew that the West
the Europeans would be hesitant

  
about imposing too strict
a sanction regime

  
for fear of being hurt by it themselves

  
And this was the basis
for Putin's war plan

  
But there was one big unknown

  
Nobody could say for sure
how the Ukrainian people would react

  
And there was always the option

  
that maybe Putin's fantasy
would come true

  
Maybe the Russians will march in

  
Zelenskyy would flee

  
maybe the Ukrainian army
will just capitulate

  
and the population would not do much

  
This was always an option

  
And now we know this was just fantasy

  
Now we know that the Ukrainians
are fighting they will fight

  
And this derails the whole
rationale of Putin’s war

  
Because you can conquer
the country maybe

  
but you won't be able to absorb
Ukraine back into Russia

  
The only thing he's accomplishing

  
he is planting seeds of hatred

  
in the hearts of every Ukrainian

  
Every Ukrainian being killed

  
every day this war continues
is more seeds of hatred

  
that may last for generations

  
Ukrainians and Russians
didn't hate each other before Putin

  
They’re siblings

  
Now he's making them enemies

  
And if he continues
this will be his legacy

  
BG We're going to talk a bit
about that again later but you know

  
at the same time
Putin needs a victory right

  
The cost the human economic
political cost of this war

  
not even a week in
is already astronomical

  
So to justify it and also
to remain by the way

  
a viable leader at the head of Russia

  
Putin needs to win
and even win convincingly

  
So how do we square these things

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean the fact that you need to win
doesn't mean that you can win

  
Lots of political leaders need to win
and sometimes they lose

  
He could stop the war
declare that he won

  
and say that recognizing
Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians

  
is what he really wanted all along
and he achieved this

  
Maybe they cobble this agreement
or I don’t know

  
This is the job of politicians
I'm not a politician

  
But I can tell you that I hope
for the sake of everybody 

  
Ukrainians Russians
and the whole of humanity 

  
that this war stops immediately

  
Because if it doesn't

  
it's not only the Ukrainians
and the Russians

  
that will suffer terribly

  
Everybody will suffer terribly
if this war continues

  
BG Explain why

  
YNH Because of the shock waves
destabilizing the whole world

  
Let’s start with the bottom line

  
budgets

  
We have been living in an amazing era
of peace in the last few decades

  
And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy

  
You saw it in the bottom line

  
You saw it in the budgets

  
In Europe in the European Union

  
the average defense budget of EU members

  
was around three percent
of government budget

  
And that's a historical miracle almost

  
For most of history

  
the budget of kings and emperors
and sultans like  percent

  
 percent goes to war goes to the army

  
In Europe it’s just three percent

  
In the whole world the average
is about six percent I think

  
factcheck me on this
but this is the figure that I know

  
six percent

  
What we saw already within a few days

  
Germany doubles
its military budget in a day

  
And I'm not against it

  
Given what they are facing
it's reasonable

  
For the Germans for the Poles

  
for all of Europe to double their budgets

  
And you see other countries
around the world doing the same thing

  
But this is you know
a race to the bottom

  
When they double their budgets

  
other countries look and feel insecure
and double their budgets

  
so they have to double
them again and triple them

  
And the money that should go
to health care

  
that should go to education

  
that should go to fight climate change

  
this money will now go to tanks
to missiles to fighting wars

  
So there is less
health care for everybody

  
and there is maybe no solution
to climate change

  
because the money goes to tanks

  
And in this way
even if you live in Australia

  
even if you live in Brazil

  
you will feel the repercussions
of this war in less health care

  
in a deteriorating ecological crisis

  
in many other things

  
Again another very central
question is technology

  
We are on the verge
we are already in the middle actually

  
of new technological arms races
in fields like artificial intelligence

  
And we need global agreement
about how to regulate AI

  
and to prevent the worst scenarios

  
How can we get a global agreement on AI

  
when you have a new cold war
a new hot war

  
So in this field to all hopes

  
of stopping the AI arms race
will go up in smoke if this war continues

  
So again everybody around the world
will feel the consequences in many ways

  
This is much much bigger
than just another regional conflict

  
BG If one of Putin's goals here
is to divide Europe

  
to weaken the transatlantic alliance

  
and the global liberal order

  
he seems to kind of accidentally
have revitalized all of them in a way

  
USEU relations have never been
so close in many years

  
And so how do you read that

  
YNH Well again in this sense
he also lost the war

  
If his aim was to divide
Europe to divide NATO

  
he's achieved exactly the opposite

  
I mean I was amazed by how quick

  
how strong and how unanimous
the European reaction was

  
I think the Europeans
surprised themselves

  
You even see countries like Finland
and Sweden sending arms to Ukraine

  
and closing their airspace

  
They didn't even do it in the Cold War

  
It's really amazing to see it

  
I think another very important thing
is what has been dividing the West

  
over the several years now

  
it’s what people term the “culture war”

  
The culture war between left and right
between conservatives and liberals

  
And I think this war can be an opportunity

  
to end the culture war within the West

  
to make peace in the culture war

  
First of all because you suddenly realize
we are all in this together

  
There are much bigger things in the world

  
than these arguments
between left and right

  
within the Western democracies

  
And it's a reminder
that we need to stand united

  
to protect Western liberal democracies

  
But it's deeper than that

  
Much of the argument
between left and right

  
seemed to be in terms of a contradiction

  
between liberalism and nationalism

  
Like you need to choose

  
And the right goes with nationalism

  
and the left goes more liberalism

  
And Ukraine is a reminder that no
the two actually go together

  
Historically nationalism
and liberalism are not opposites

  
They are not enemies

  
They are friends they go together

  
They meet around the central value
of freedom of liberty

  
And to see a nation fighting
for its survival

  
fighting for its freedom

  
you see it on Fox News
or you see it in CNN

  
And yes they tell the story
a little differently

  
but they suddenly see the same reality

  
And they find common ground

  
And the common ground is to understand

  
that nationalism is not about hating
minorities or hating foreigners

  
it's about loving your compatriots

  
and reaching a peaceful agreement

  
about how we want
to run our country together

  
And I hope that seeing what is happening

  
would help to end
the culture war in the West

  
And if this happens we don't need
to worry about anything

  
You know when you look
at the real power balance

  
if the Europeans stick together

  
if the Americans and
the Europeans stick together

  
and stop this culture war
and stop tearing themselves apart

  
they have absolutely nothing to fear 
the Russians or anybody else

  
BG I'm going to ask you a question later
about the stories the West tells itself

  
but let me zoom out for a second
and get a larger perspective

  
You wrote another essay
last week in “The Economist”

  
and you argue that what's at stake
in Ukraine is and I quote you

  
"the direction of human history"

  
because it puts at risk what you call

  
the greatest political and moral
achievement of modern civilization

  
which is the decline of war

  
So now we are back in a war
and potentially afterwards

  
into a new form of cold war or hot war

  
but hopefully not

  
Elaborate about that essay you wrote

  
YNH Yeah I mean some people think

  
that all this talk
about the decline of war

  
was always just a fantasy

  
But 

  
Again you look at the statistics

  
Since 

  
there has not been a single clash
between superpowers

  
whereas previously in history

  
this was you know
the basic stuff of history

  
Since 

  
not a single internationally
recognized country

  
was wiped off the map
by external invasion

  
This was the common thing in history

  
Until then and then it stopped

  
This is an amazing achievement

  
which is the basis for everything we have

  
for our medical services

  
for education system

  
and this is all now in jeopardy

  
Because this era of peace

  
it wasn't the result of some miracle

  
It wasn't the result of a change
in the laws of nature

  
It was humans making better decisions
and building better institutions

  
which means also

  
that there is no guarantee for the future

  
If humans some humans
start making bad decisions

  
and start destroying
the institutions that kept the peace

  
then we will be back in the era of war

  
with budgets military budgets
going to    percent

  
It can happen

  
It's in our hands

  
And I'll just say one more thing

  
When not just me but other scholars
like Steven Pinker and others

  
talked about the era of peace

  
some people understood it
as kind of encouraging complacency

  
That oh we don't need
to worry about anything

  
No I mean the message
was really the opposite

  
It was a message of responsibility

  
If you think that there is no
era of peace in history

  
it's always war it's always the jungle

  
there is a constant level
of violence in nature

  
then this basically means

  
that there is no point
struggling for peace

  
and there is no responsibility
on leaders like Putin

  
because you can't blame Putin for the war

  
It's just a law of nature
that there are wars

  
When you realize no humans are able
to decrease the level of violence

  
then it should make us
much more responsible

  
And it should also make us understand

  
that the war in Ukraine now
it’s not a natural disaster

  
It’s a manmade disaster
and a single man

  
It's not the Russian people
who want this war

  
There's really just a single person

  
who by his decisions

  
created this tragedy

  
BG So one of the things
that has come back

  
in the last weeks and months
is the nuclear threat

  
It's moved back into the center
of political and strategic considerations

  
Putin has talked about it several times

  
the other day he ordered Russia's
nuclear forces on a higher alert status

  
President Zelenskyy himself
at the Munich Security Conference

  
essentially said that Ukraine
had made a mistake

  
abandoning the nuclear weapons
it had inherited from the Soviet Union

  
That's a statement that I suspect
many countries are pondering

  
What's your thinking about the return
of the nuclear threat

  
YNH It's extremely frightening

  
You know it's like it's almost Freudian

  
it's the return of the repressed

  
We thought that oh nuclear weapons yes

  
there was something
about that in the s

  
with the Cuban Missile Crisis
and Dr Strangelove

  
But no it's here

  
And you know it took just a few days

  
of difficulties on the battlefield

  
for suddenly 

  
I mean I'm watching
television like the news

  
and you have these experts
explaining to people

  
what different nuclear weapons will do
to this city or to this country

  
It rushed back in

  
So you know nuclear weapons are 

  
in a way they also until now
preserved the peace of the world

  
I belong to the school of thought
that if it was not for nuclear weapons

  
we would have had the Third World War

  
between the Soviet Union
and the United States and NATO

  
sometime in the s or 's

  
That nuclear weapons actually
until today served a good function

  
It's because of nuclear weapons

  
that we did not have any more
direct clashes between superpowers

  
because it was obvious
that this would be collective suicide

  
But the danger is still there
it's always there

  
If there is miscalculation

  
then the results could of course

  
be existential catastrophic

  
BG And at the same time you know
in the 's after Cuba and Berlin

  
and so in the 's but in the 's

  
we started building a sort of
international institutional architecture

  
that helped reduce the risk of military
confrontation of nuclear weapons

  
we used you know anything
from arms control agreements

  
to measures designed to build trust
or to communicate directly and so on

  
And then in the last decade or so

  
that has been progressively
kind of scrapped

  
so we are even in a more
dangerous situation

  
than we were let's say
at the end of the last century

  
YNH Completely I mean

  
we are now reaping
the bad fruits of neglect

  
that's been going on for several years

  
not just about nuclear
weapons but in general

  
about international institutions
and global cooperation

  
We’ve built in the late th century

  
a house for humanity

  
based on cooperation

  
based on collaboration

  
based on the understanding

  
that our future depends
on being able to cooperate

  
otherwise we will become
extinct as a species

  
And we all live in this house

  
But in the last few years we stopped 

  
we neglected it we stopped repairing it

  
We allow it to deteriorate more and more

  
And you know eventually it will 

  
It is collapsing now

  
So I hope that people will realize
before it's too late

  
that we need not just
to stop this terrible war

  
we need to rebuild the institutions

  
we need to repair the global house
in which we all live together

  
If it falls down we all die

  
BG So we have
among the audience listening

  
Rola from 

  
I don't know where she's from
she grew up in Lebanon 

  
and she said "I lived the war
I slept on the ground I breathed fear

  
All the reasons were explained to me
that the only remaining learning came

  
the war is absurd

  
We talk about strategy power budgets
opportunities technologies

  
What about human suffering
and psychological trauma"

  
Especially I assume what she's asking
is what about what's going to remain

  
in terms of the human suffering

  
and the psychological trauma
going forward

  
YNH Yeah I mean
these are the seeds of hatred

  
and fear and misery

  
that are being planted right now
in the minds and the bodies

  
of tens of millions
hundreds of millions of people really

  
Because it's not just
the people in Ukraine

  
it's also in the countries around
all over the world

  
And these seeds will give
a terrible harvest

  
terrible fruits in years
in decades to come

  
This is why it's so crucial
to stop the war immediately

  
Every day this continues
plants more and more of these seeds

  
And you know like this war now

  
its seeds were to a large extent

  
planted decades and even centuries ago

  
That part of the Russian fears
that are motivating Putin

  
and motivating people around him

  
is memories of past invasions of Russia

  
especially of course
in Second World War

  
And of course it's a terrible mistake

  
what they are doing with it

  
They are recreating again the same things
that they should learn to avoid

  
But yes these are still
the terrible fruits

  
of the seeds being planted in the s

  
BG It's what in same article you call

  
the fact that nations
are ultimately built on stories

  
So these seeds are the stories
we are starting to create now

  
The war in Ukraine
is starting to create the stories

  
that are going to have an impact
in the future that's what you're saying

  
YNH Some of the seeds of this war
were planted in the siege of Leningrad

  
And now it gives fruit
in the siege of Kyiv

  
which may give fruit
in  or  years in more terrible 

  
We need to cut this we need to stop this

  
You know as a historian

  
I feel sometimes ashamed
or responsible I don't know what

  
about what history the knowledge
of history is doing to people

  
In recent weeks I have been watching
all the world leaders talking with Putin

  
and very often he gave them
lectures on history

  
I think that Macron had a discussion
with him for five hours

  
and afterwards said “Most of the time
he was lecturing me about history”

  
And as a historian I feel ashamed

  
that this is what my profession
in some way is doing

  
I know it for my own country

  
In Israel we also suffer
from too much history

  
I think people should be
liberated from the past

  
not constantly repeating
it again and again

  
You know everybody should
kind of free themselves

  
from the memories of the Second World War

  
It's true of the Russians

  
it's also true of the Germans

  
You know I look at Germany now

  
and what I really want to say
if there are Germans watching us

  
what I really want to say to the Germans

  
guys we know you are not Nazis

  
You don't need to keep
proving it again and again

  
What we need from Germany now
is to stand up and be a leader

  
to be at the forefront
of the struggle for freedom

  
And sometimes Germans are afraid
that if they speak forcefully

  
or pick up a gun

  
everybody will say
"Hey you're Nazis again"

  
No we won't think that

  
BG That's happening right now

  
I mean lots of things that were
inconceivable just  days ago

  
have happened in the last few weeks

  
And one of the most striking
to me in any case

  
is Germany's reaction and transformation

  
I mean the new chancellor
Olaf Scholz the other day announced

  
that Germany will send arms to Ukraine

  
and will spend an extra  billion
dollars in building up its army

  
That reverses completely the principles

  
that have guided Germany's foreign policy

  
and security politics for decades

  
So that shift is happening exactly
at this moment and very very fast

  
YNH Yeah

  
And I think it's a good thing

  
We need the Germans to 

  
I mean they are now
the leaders of Europe

  
certainly after Britain left in Brexit

  
And we need them to in a way

  
let go of the past and be in the present

  
If there is really
one country in the world

  
that as a Jew as an Israeli
as a historian

  
that I trust it not to repeat
the horrors of Nazism

  
that's Germany

  
BG Yuval I want to touch
quickly on three things

  
that have to do with the fact
that this feels like

  
the first truly interconnected
war in many ways

  
The first of course is the basics

  
which is on one side
you have a very ancient war 

  
we have tanks and we have trenches
and we have bombed buildings 

  
and on the other we have
realtime visibility of everything

  
through cell phones and Twitter
and TikTok and so on

  
And you have written a lot
about this tension

  
between old ways and new tech

  
What's the impact here

  
YNH First of all we don't know
everything that is happening

  
I mean surprisingly with all this
TikTok and phones and everything

  
so much is not known

  
So the fog of war is still there and yes

  
there is much more information
but information isn’t truth

  
Lots of information is disinformation
and fake news and so forth

  
And yes it’s always like this;

  
the new and the old they come together

  
You know with all the talk
about interconnectedness

  
and living in cyberspace and all that

  
one of the most important technologies
not just of this war

  
but of the last decade or two
have been stone walls

  
It's Neolithic

  
Everybody is now building stone walls

  
in the era of Facebook
and Google and all that

  
So the old and the new they go together

  
And it's 

  
It is a new kind of war

  
People are sitting at home
in California or Australia

  
and they actively participate in the war

  
not just by writing tweets

  
but by attacking websites
or defending websites

  
You know in Spain in the Civil War

  
if you wanted to help fight fascism

  
then you had to go to Spain
and join the international brigade

  
Now the international brigade
is sitting at home in San Francisco

  
and is still in some way part of the war

  
So this is definitely new

  
BG So indeed just two days ago
Ukraine's deputy prime minister I think

  
Fedorov announced via Telegram

  
that he wanted to create
a sort of volunteer cyber army

  
He invited software developers and hackers

  
and other people with IT skills

  
to somehow help Ukraine
fight on the cyber front

  
And according to “Wired” magazine
in less than two days

  
 people signed up

  
So here is a defending nation
that can kind of recruit almost overnight

  
 volunteers
to go to battle on his behalf

  
It's a very different kind of war

  
YNH Yeah

  
You know every war brings it surprises

  
Sometimes it's how everything is new

  
but sometimes it's also
how everything is old

  
BG So a few people in the chat
and in the Q and A have mentioned China

  
which of course
is an important actor here

  
although for now is mostly an observer

  
But China has a stated policy
of opposing any act

  
that violates territorial integrity

  
So moving into Ukraine of course
violates territorial integrity

  
And it also has a huge interest
in a stable global economy

  
and global system

  
But then it needs to square this
with the recent closeness with Russia

  
Xi Jinping and Putin met in Beijing
before the Olympics for example

  
and kind of had this message of friendship
that went out to the world

  
How do you read China's position
in this conflict

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean I'm not an expert on China

  
and I certainly can't just 

  
You know just reading the news
won't get you into the mindset

  
into the real opinions and positions
of the Chinese leadership

  
I hope that they take
a responsible position

  
And act 

  
because they are close to Russia

  
they are also close to Ukraine

  
but especially because
they are close to Russia

  
they have a lot of influence on Russia

  
I hope that they will be
the responsible adults

  
that will put down the flames of this war

  
They have a lot to lose

  
from a breakdown of the global order

  
And I think they have a lot to win
from the return of peace

  
including in terms of the gratitude
of the international community

  
Now whether they do it or not
this is with them

  
I can't predict but I hope so

  
BG You have mentioned before
the several European and Western leaders

  
that have gone to Moscow
in the weeks before the invasion

  
Varun in the chat asks

  
"Is the Ukraine war
a failure of diplomacy"

  
Could have 

  
Something different happened

  
YNH Oh you can understand it
in two questions

  
Did diplomacy fail to stop the war

  
Absolutely everybody knows that

  
But is it a failure in the sense
that a different diplomatic approach

  
some kind of other proposition
would have stopped the war

  
I don't know but it doesn't seem like it

  
I mean looking at the events
of the last few weeks

  
it doesn't seem that Putin
was really interested

  
in a diplomatic solution

  
It seemed that he was really
interested in the war

  
and I think again
it goes back to this basic fantasy

  
that if he really was concerned
about the security situation of Russia

  
then there was no need
to immediately invade Ukraine

  
There was no immediate threat to Russia

  
There was no discussion of right now
Ukraine joining NATO

  
There was no invasion army assembling
in the Baltic states or in Poland

  
Nothing

  
Putin chose the moment
to start this crisis

  
So this is why it doesn't seem

  
that it's really
about the security concerns

  
It seems more about this very deep fantasy

  
of reestablishing the Russian Empire

  
and of denying the very existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
BG So you live in the Middle East

  
Someone else in the chat asks

  
"What makes the situation so unique

  
compared to many other wars
that are going on right now in the world"

  
I would say aside from the nuclear
threat from Russia but what else

  
YNH Several things

  
First of all

  
we have here again something
we haven't seen since 

  
which is a dominant power

  
trying to basically
obliterate from the map

  
an independent country

  
You know when the US invaded Afghanistan

  
or when the US invaded Iraq

  
you can say a lot of things about it

  
and criticize it in many ways

  
There was no question
of the US annexing Iraq

  
or turning Iraq into the st state
of the United States

  
This is what is happening in Ukraine

  
under this pretext or this disguise

  
this is what's at stake

  
The real aim is to annex Ukraine

  
If this succeeds

  
again it brings us back
to the era of war

  
I was struck by what
the Kenyan representative

  
to the UN Security Council said
when this erupted

  
The Kenyan representative spoke
in the name of Kenya

  
and other African countries

  
And he told the Russians

  
Look we also are the product
of a postimperial order

  
The same way the Soviet empire collapsed
into different independent nations

  
also African nations came out
of the collapse of European empires

  
And the basic principle
of African politics ever since then

  
was that no matter what your objections

  
to the borders you have inherited

  
keep the borders

  
The borders are sacred

  
because if we start invading
neighboring countries because

  
"Hey this is part of our countries

  
these people are part of our nation"

  
there will not be an end to it

  
And if this now happens in Ukraine

  
it will be a blueprint for copycats
all over the world

  
The other thing which is different
is that we are talking about superpowers

  
This is not a war
between Israel and Hezbollah

  
This is potentially a war
between Russia and NATO

  
And even leaving aside nuclear weapons

  
this completely destabilizes
the peace of the entire world

  
And again I go back again
and again to the budgets

  
That if Germany doubles
its defense budget

  
if Poland doubles its defense budget

  
this will spread to every
country in the world

  
and this is terrible news

  
BG So Yuval I'm jumping
from topic to topic

  
because I want to use the last few minutes

  
to ask a few questions from the audience

  
A few people are asking
about the link to the climate crisis

  
particularly when it relates
to the energy flows

  
Like Europe is very dependent

  
part of Europe is very dependent
on Russian oil and gas

  
which is as far as we know
still flowing until today

  
But could this crisis
in a sort of paradoxical way

  
a bit like the pandemic
accelerate climate action

  
accelerate renewables and and so on

  
YNH This is the hope

  
That Europe now realizes the danger

  
and starts a green Manhattan Project

  
that kind of accelerates
what already has been happening

  
but accelerates it

  
the development of better energy sources

  
better energy infrastructure

  
which would release it
from its dependence on oil and gas

  
And it will actually undercut
the dependence of the whole world

  
on oil and gas

  
And this would be the best way
to undermine the Putin regime

  
and the Putin war machine

  
because this is what Russia has

  
oil and gas

  
That's it

  
When was the last time you bought
anything made in Russia

  
They have oil and gas

  
and we know you know the curse of oil

  
That oil is a source of riches

  
but it’s also very often
a support for dictatorships

  
Because to enjoy the benefits of oil

  
you don't need to share it
with your citizens

  
You don't need an open society

  
you don't need education
you just need to drill

  
So we see in many places

  
that oil and gas are actually
the basis for dictatorships

  
If oil and gas if the price drops

  
if they become irrelevant

  
it will not only undercut the finance

  
the power of the Russian military machine

  
it will also force Russia

  
force Putin or the Russians
to change their regime

  
BG OK let me bring up a character

  
that everybody here in the chat
seems to find quite heroic

  
and that's the Ukrainian president

  
So Ukraine kind of finds itself

  
with a comedian who turned
almost accidental president

  
who turned now war president

  
But he has shown an impressive conduct
in the last few weeks

  
especially in the last few days

  
which can be summarized
in that response he gave to the US

  
when they offered
to kind of exfiltrate him

  
so he could lead a government in exile

  
he said "I need ammunition
I don't need a ride"

  
How would you look at President Zelenskyy

  
YNH His conduct
has indeed been admirable

  
and he gives courage and inspiration
not just to the Ukrainian people

  
but I think to everybody around the world

  
I think to a large extent

  
the swift and united reaction of Europe

  
with the sanctions
and sending arms and so forth

  
to a large extent this is also
to the credit of Zelenskyy

  
That you know

  
when politicians are also human beings

  
And his direct appeal to them

  
and you know they met him
many times in person

  
and to see where he is now

  
and the threat that not only him
but his family is also in

  
And you know they talk with him

  
and he says and they know
that this may be the last time they speak

  
He may be dead murdered or bombed
in an hour or in a day

  
It really changes something

  
So in this sense I think he made
a huge personal contribution

  
to not just the reaction in Ukraine
but around the world

  
BG So Sam who’s listening
asked this question

  
"Can you provide some historical context

  
for the force and the meaning
of economic and trade sanctions

  
at the level where they are
currently imposed

  
How have previous wouldbe empires
wouldbe aggressors or aggressors

  
been constrained by such
isolations and such sanctions"

  
YNH You know what we need
again to realize about Putin's Russia

  
is that it's not the Soviet Union

  
It's a much smaller and weaker country

  
It's not like in the s

  
that in addition to the Soviet Union

  
you had the entire Soviet bloc around it

  
So it's easier in this sense
to isolate it

  
It's much more vulnerable

  
Again does it mean that sanctions
would work like a miracle

  
and stop the tanks No

  
It takes time

  
But I think that the West is in a position

  
to impact Russia

  
with these kinds of sanctions
and isolation much more

  
than let's say with the Soviet Union

  
And also the Russian people are different

  
The Russian people
don't really want this war

  
even the people in the immediate
circle around Putin

  
You know again

  
I don't know them personally
from what it seems

  
it's that these people they like life

  
They have their yachts
and they have their private airplanes

  
and they have their house in London

  
and they have their chateau in France

  
And they like the good life

  
and they want to keep enjoying it

  
So I think that the sanctions
can be really effective

  
What's the timetable

  
That's ultimately in the hands of Putin

  
BG So Gabriella asks “I remember
the war in former Yugoslavia

  
and the atrocities there

  
Is there any possibility that this war
would escalate into such a situation"

  
I think an extension to that is

  
Is this war kind of stirring
dormant conflicts

  
like in the Balkans for example

  
or in the former Central Asian republic

  
YNH Unfortunately it can get
to that level and even worse

  
If you want an analogy go to Syria

  
You look at what happened in Homs

  
At what happened in Aleppo

  
And this was done by Putin
and his airplanes

  
and his minions in Syria

  
It's the same person behind it

  
And to think that "No no no
this happened in the Middle East

  
It can't happen in Europe"

  
No

  
We could see Kyiv
in the same situation as Homs

  
as the same situation as Aleppo

  
which would be catastrophic

  
and again would plant
terrible seeds of hatred

  
for years and decades

  
So far we've seen
hundreds of people being killed

  
Ukrainian citizens being killed

  
It could reach tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands

  
So in this sense it's extremely
painful to contemplate

  
And this is why we need again and again

  
to urge the leaders to stop this war

  
and especially again and again

  
tell Putin

  
"You will not be able
to absorb Ukraine into Russia

  
They don't want it they don't want you

  
If you continue

  
the only thing you will achieve
is to create terrible hatred

  
between Ukrainians and Russians
for generations

  
It doesn't have to be like that"

  
BG Yuval let me finish
with one question about your county

  
You are in Israel

  
Israel has close ties
with both Russia and Ukraine

  
It's actually home of many Russianborn
and many Ukrainianborn Jews

  
How is the country reacting
to this conflict

  
I'm talking about the government
but also about the population

  
YNH Actually I'm not
the best person to ask

  
I've been so kind of following
what's happening around the world

  
I didn't pay so much attention
to what is happening right here

  
And even though I live here

  
I'm not an expert on Israeli society
or Israeli politics

  
Definitely the sentiment in the street
in the social media is with Ukraine

  
You see Ukrainian flags

  
you see on social media
people putting Ukrainian flags

  
on their accounts

  
And another thing
so many people in Israel

  
they came from the former Soviet Union

  
And until now

  
everybody was simply known as Russians

  
You know even if you came from Azerbaijan
or you came from Bukhara

  
you were a Russian

  
And suddenly "No no no no no

  
I'm not Russian

  
I'm Ukrainian"

  
And again these seeds of hatred
that Putin is planting

  
it's reaching also here

  
That suddenly people are saying
no Russian Ukrainian

  
until a very short time ago
it's the same thing

  
No it's not the same thing

  
So the shock waves are spreading

  
BG Yuval thank you for taking the time
and being with us today

  
and sharing your knowledge
and your views on the situation

  
Thank you very much

  
YNH Thank you
and I hope for peace quickly

  
BG We all do Thank you

Bruno Giussani It's difficult
to think clearly

  
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
because wars while they unfold

  
they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog

  
Information is abundant

  
the millions of refugees

  
the shocking suffering
and the destruction the politics

  
But sense is lacking

  
And that's going to be the focus
of this Membership conversation

  
as we enter the third week of the war

  
We won’t talk about the events of the day

  
but try to project a longer arc
a broader context

  
Our guest is geopolitical
analyst Ian Bremmer

  
He's the founder
and president of Eurasia Group

  
and we asked him to lay the scene

  
by talking first
about the geopolitical shifts

  
that have already been brought
by the war in Ukraine

  
And after we're going to have
a conversation

  
including questions from TED Members
who are participating in this call

  
Ian welcome

  
Ian Bremmer Thank you very much

  
I'll start by saying that in my lifetime

  
the most important geopolitical artifact
is the fall of the Berlin Wall

  
I mean you see it

  
if you go into the new
NATO headquarters in Brussels

  
just built a few years ago

  
And anyone that has a piece
something they're very proud of

  
they know it affected their entire lives

  
I think that in  years' time

  
and I fear that in  years' time

  
if we look back

  
a second most important
geopolitical artifact

  
will be a piece of the rubble
of the Maidan in Kyiv

  
I believe that the war
that we are seeing right now

  
is no more and no less

  
than the end of the peace dividend

  
that we all thought we had

  
when the wall came down in 

  
The idea that the world could focus
more on globalization

  
and goods and services
and people and ideas

  
going faster and faster across borders

  
leading to unprecedented growth
in human development

  
and a global middle class

  
I think that this is a tipping point

  
Won't end globalization

  
but it does end the peace dividend

  
It does mean that the Europeans overnight

  
will and must prioritize
spending on defense policy

  
on national security
coordination on NATO

  
And the speech that was given
by Olaf Scholz

  
the new chancellor two weeks ago

  
in my view the most significant speech
given by a European leader

  
in the postCold War environment

  
precisely because it's now
the postpostCold War environment

  
sending weapons to the Ukrainians

  
committing to over two percent
of GDP spend on defense

  
investing in a new fund
for defense infrastructure

  
But also recognizing that the way

  
that the Germans
and the Europeans as a whole

  
looked at the world
and looked at themselves was

  
unfortunately for all of us outdated

  
A few other points I'd like to raise
just to kick off this conversation

  
One

  
One of the reasons
I'm pretty negative about this

  
and I'm not usually very negative
I'm usually an existential optimist

  
I’m someone that’s just happy
there’s water in the glass

  
But when I look at this conflict
I’m much more concerned

  
And that is because I do not
see a scenario

  
a plausible scenario
in the foreseeable future

  
where Putin emerges from this war

  
in anything less than a radically
weakened position

  
compared to where he was
before he announced the invasion

  
And I believe that both in terms
of his domestic political orientation

  
how stable he is in his own country

  
also of course
Russia's economic position

  
and finally Russia's position
in terms of global security

  
and European security

  
ostensibly the very reason that Putin
began the war to begin with

  
Second big point is that the decoupling
that we are seeing from Europe

  
and the United States with Russia
is in my view permanent

  
And that would be true even if there were
a negotiated settlement

  
and all the Russian troops
were to pull out of Ukraine

  
and we had peace

  
I still think that a lot
of those companies would not come back

  
with Putin in power

  
I'm convinced that the decisions
by the Europeans

  
to ramp up their national security
capabilities will be permanent

  
Permanent deployments coming
in the Baltic states for example

  
forward deployments in Poland
and Bulgaria and Romania

  
And also an unwind of Europe’s
massive energy dependence

  
coal oil and most importantly gas

  
on Russia

  
That does not make Russia a global pariah

  
because you can't be a global pariah

  
if the soontobe most important
economy in the world China

  
is actually your bestie
on the global stage

  
and that indeed continues to be true

  
despite China's efforts
to portray themselves

  
towards Europe at least

  
as more neutral

  
We are going to see the Russians
as a supplicant economically

  
in terms of energy flows

  
financially in terms of transactions

  
and technologically
perhaps most important

  
aligned with China

  
That has big geopolitical
implications longterm

  
Also a lot of other developing
economies like the Indians

  
like the Gulf states like Brazil

  
are also not going to work
with Russia as a pariah

  
They'll continue to engage

  
Are there any silver linings

  
And I think there are a few

  
Of course there is a much greater
renewed purpose and mission of NATO

  
I mean this is an organization
that just a couple of years ago

  
France President Emmanuel Macron
referred to as “braindead”

  
It was increasingly drifting
in terms of its importance

  
The Americans were focusing
much more on Asia the pivot

  
Not today

  
Today NATO is purposeful

  
it's aligned it's consolidated

  
it's going to get more
resources not less

  
That's also true of the European
Union as a whole

  
even when we talk about countries
like Hungary and Poland

  
that have been much less aligned
in terms of rule of law

  
in terms of an independent judiciary

  
much more aligned in terms
of the importance

  
of common values of Europe

  
compared to that of what
we're seeing in Moscow

  
I mentioned the German security
and policy shift

  
The UKEU relationship is much
smoother and more functional

  
than at any point since Brexit
process actually started

  
And even the United States

  
I mean if you watched
the State of the Union

  
for a brief moment in time
five or  minutes

  
when all of the Democrats and Republicans
were standing and applauding together

  
you could be forgiven for believing
that the United States

  
had a functional representative democracy

  
Now I'm not sure how long
this is going to last

  
but at least as of now

  
leaders of the Democratic
and Republican Party

  
see Putin as much more
of a threat an enemy

  
than they do their opponents
across the aisle in domestic politics

  
And two weeks ago that was not true

  
That's significant

  
Final silver lining
and I wish it was more of one

  
but the Chinese

  
as much as they are strategically
aligned with Russia

  
and with the person of President Putin

  
they do not want a second Cold War

  
And they would rather
a negotiated settlement

  
They're not willing to push
very hard for it

  
But they certainly do not see
a radical decoupling of the Russian

  
and potentially the Chinese economy

  
from the rest of the world from Europe

  
from the US from the advanced
industrial democracies

  
as in any way in their interest

  
And ultimately that does create
at least some buffer

  
some guardrail on how much this is likely
to escalate as a conflict going forward

  
BG I want to make a step back
and unpack some of that

  
maybe starting with a question
that relates to your last point

  
and is probably on the mind of many

  
And it is

  
Is there still some real
space for negotiation

  
Is there still a potential relationship
between Russia and Ukraine

  
IB The foreign ministers of Russia
and Ukraine just met recently in Turkey

  
It was as much of a nonevent

  
as the three preceding negotiations
of more junior representatives

  
of their teams on the Belarus border

  
The one thing that has been
accomplished to a small degree

  
has been humanitarian corridors

  
extending out of a number
of Ukrainian cities

  
that are being pounded
by Russian military

  
That's because the Ukrainians are
interested in protecting their civilians

  
and the Russians are interested
in taking a lot of territory

  
without necessarily having to kill
so many Ukrainians

  
that could cause problems
for them internationally

  
as well as domestically inside Russia

  
But that is nowhere close
to a negotiated settlement

  
Now I mean everyone I know

  
that's involved
in the negotiations right now

  
responds that the President Putin himself
is hellbent on taking Kyiv

  
and on removing Zelenskyy from power

  
Now I think and by the way
they're getting quite close

  
to being able to accomplish that
militarily on the ground

  
I think within the next couple of weeks
certainly it looks very likely

  
A couple of points here

  
One there is no reason to put
any stock in anything

  
that the Russians are saying publicly
in terms of their diplomacy

  
They lied to the face
of every world leader

  
about the invasion that they said
they were not going to do into Ukraine

  
And then just today

  
Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov publicly said

  
well the Russians didn't attack Ukraine

  
I mean this is Orwellian stuff right

  
So first of all do not report
on Russian public statements

  
as if they bear any semblance
to reality on the ground

  
Secondarily this looks like a huge
loss for Putin right now

  
He understands it and I think
he would have a hard time

  
even with his control of information
spinning this to his public

  
without removing Zelenskyy

  
without the “deNazification”
as he calls it 

  
which is an obscenity in an environment

  
where the Ukrainian president
is actually Jewish 

  
the disarmament of Ukraine

  
and of course the ability of the Russians

  
to change how they feel about Ukraine
as a threat to the Russian homeland

  
BG What level of support
can we give Ukraine militarily

  
intel economic

  
before Putin considers
taking a strike on a NATO country

  
IB Well it’s interesting the way
you framed that Bruno

  
Because I mean

  
I think that Putin is already considering
strikes on NATO countries

  
I mean there were massive attacks

  
cyberattacks and disinformation attacks

  
by Russia against NATO countries
with reckless abandon

  
over the course of the past years

  
And in fact when President Biden
met with Putin in Geneva back in June

  
it seems like years
and years ago at this point

  
Biden set the agenda

  
Ukraine was largely not discussed

  
but what was discussed was cyberattacks
on critical infrastructure

  
Because you may remember Bruno

  
that meeting came right after
the cyber attacks

  
against the Colonial Pipeline

  
And the Russians after that
indeed pulled back

  
on supporting those attacks
by their criminal cyber syndicates

  
I expect those attacks to restart
in very short order

  
against NATO countries

  
I also believe that the fact that the West
is sending weapons to Ukraine

  
and is providing realtime
intelligence reports

  
on the disposition of Russian troops
on the ground in Ukraine

  
to better allow the Ukrainians
to defend themselves

  
and blow the Russians up

  
that is considered by the Russians
to be an act of war

  
and they will retaliate

  
And how they retaliate is the question

  
I don't think they're going to send
troops into Poland

  
But you know

  
when the Americans under Reagan
were providing that kind of support

  
to the mujahideen

  
to help them defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan

  
the Soviets saw that as an act of war

  
and they engaged in acts of terrorism
against the mujahideen in Pakistan

  
And I absolutely think
that that is on the table

  
in terms of front line
NATO countries especially

  
like Poland like the Baltic states
like Bulgaria Romania

  
Would that be considered
an Article V attack

  
Would that force NATO countries
to strike the Russians back

  
I'm not sure it would

  
Not directly not militarily

  
So I mean I do think that the fact
that the NATO countries see

  
there is some sort of a big red line
between sending troops in for example

  
and doing a nofly zone
because that could cause World War III

  
but everything short of that
is just a proxy war

  
The Russians don't see it that way

  
And that gives the Russians
some advantage tactically

  
in terms of their willingness to escalate

  
BG You're describing a spiral
of escalation here

  
that will touch the globe
and not only Ukraine

  
not only the eastern flank of Europe

  
which means that not only this war
has ripple effects everywhere

  
but this is also starting
a sort of realignment

  
of the global geopolitical
situation and context

  
To me it has been very striking
how Europe and the US

  
have kind of moved very fast
in a cohesive way

  
And it has chosen after years
of prioritizing the economics

  
in their international
and global dealings

  
it's chosen to put politics over markets

  
It has adopted sanctions
that will hurt Russia

  
but will also hurt Western businesses

  
It’s the discussion about decoupling
that you put forward before

  
an active kind of fencing out
of the Russian economy

  
Talk to us about how do you see
this decoupling playing out

  
IB Yeah I mean I do think
that for the Europeans

  
this is a permanent move

  
I mean I've spoken to top leaders
in the German government

  
who tell me that Nord Stream
was a strategic mistake

  
and they understand it

  
Who say that you know

  
Scholz making this speech
from the Social Democratic Party

  
on the center left

  
is the equivalent of Nixon going to China

  
No one else could have made that move

  
But having made it everyone is on board

  
The popularity in Germany

  
even given the massive
economic consequences

  
is extraordinary and is across the board

  
And what they need to do now

  
is ensure that the diversification
of fossil fuels in the near term

  
away from Russia

  
towards Qatar and Azerbaijan
and even you know

  
sort of the United States for LNG

  
can be done as fast as humanly possible

  
And that further even though
it’s going to cost a lot

  
some of it will be uneconomic

  
the move towards renewables
actually picks up and is faster

  
The Italians Mario Draghi

  
I think his shift in strategic
orientation that they will do

  
this is his "whatever it takes" moment

  
He had that in response
to the  financial crisis

  
as the head of the European Central Bank

  
and that made him “Super Mario”

  
This is making him Super Mario
as the Italian prime minister

  
This is the "whatever it takes"
moment for the Italians

  
who never make public statements
that undermine their economic

  
their commercial interests
like this in such a strategic way

  
The French of course
have less to be concerned about

  
in the sense that most of their energy
comes from nuclear power and is domestic

  
So they are not as affected directly
by a cutoff from Russia

  
And also because Macron fancies himself

  
especially as the leader
of the European Commission this year

  
the rotating leadership
occupying the presidency

  
but also with his elections coming up

  
and just given his personal belief
that he can drive diplomacy

  
I believe that even after Kyiv falls

  
and after Zelenskyy
is either killed or forced out

  
that the Americans will not want
to engage in direct diplomacy

  
the Germans probably won't

  
The French will

  
And by the way the Chinese will too

  
And I do believe
that there is a potential

  
and this is a danger
for the cohesiveness of the West

  
that the Chinese and Macron end up being
the postKyiv Normandy format

  
of diplomacy

  
That's something that the Americans
and the Germans right now

  
are starting to worry about quite a bit

  
Now that's the European shift

  
And I think as I said
I think it's permanent

  
I believe the UK is in that camp as well

  
I'm not so sure the United States
is going to be as committed

  
for as long a term

  
It doesn't affect the Americans
as much economically

  
it doesn't affect the Americans as much
in terms of a direct security issue

  
None of those refugees are coming
to the United States

  
But also American inequality

  
American political polarization
and dysfunction is so much greater

  
than what you experience
on the continent in Europe

  
So the potential that in six months' time
or in two years' time

  
as we're thinking about the  election

  
that the Americans have largely forgotten
about this Russia issue instead

  
are focusing once again
on domestic political opponents

  
as principal adversaries

  
which deeply undermines NATO

  
much more than anything
that would come from the Europeans

  
I think that is a real
open question going forward

  
that is perhaps as significant
as the question of where the Chinese go

  
BG Let me pick up on the point
you made about energy

  
because somehow Putin's calculus
can really change

  
if Russian oil and gas
stops flowing to Europe

  
if it becomes part
of the sanctions right

  
And this war indeed can kind of be read

  
as a war about energy

  
Selling energy funds it for Russia

  
being dependent on Russian energy makes
the European response more constrained

  
Rising energy insecurity
rising energy cost

  
may or probably will destabilize
European politics and economy

  
in the coming months

  
How would you look at this
from the perspective of energy

  
and is there any likelihood

  
that Russian oil and gas
is going to stop flowing

  
either because Putin cuts it
or the Europeans sanction it

  
IB Yeah or because it's blown up
in some of the transit in Ukraine

  
I mean keep in mind

  
so much of the gas transit
is going through large pipeline networks

  
which have some redundancy
across all of Ukraine

  
But there's a big war
that's going on right there

  
and lots of people that could have
incentive to create problems

  
The Americans of course the Canadians

  
have said that they're cutting off
oil import from Russia

  
but those are nominal numbers

  
so they don't matter very
much to the markets

  
The Europeans as I said

  
want to decouple themselves
as quickly as possible

  
but they believe that doing that this year
would be economic suicide

  
So there isn't despite everything
we see from Russia

  
they're using thermobaric weapons now
against the Ukrainian people

  
the Americans are warning

  
that they could use chemical
biological weapons against Ukraine

  
I mean you know
you even have some people saying

  
what if they use
a tactical nuclear weapon

  
I mean 

  
God willing none of these
things come to pass

  
But it is very hard to see
a military scenario in Ukraine

  
that leads the Europeans

  
to completely cut off their inbound gas
from Russia this year

  
It's very hard to see

  
And also I would say it's very hard
to see any level of economic sanction

  
that would change the mind of the Russians

  
in terms of their military decision making

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now I think there are a lot of things
that the West is doing

  
in terms of providing weapons
for the Ukrainians

  
that are having an impact on the ground

  
A lot more Russians are getting killed

  
It won’t prevent them
from taking to Kyiv again in my mind

  
I feel quite confident about that

  
But it's quite possible
perhaps even likely

  
that the west of Ukraine
will remain in Ukrainian hands

  
which means that you know
after this fighting is "over"

  
that a rump Ukrainian state in exile
exists in the West run by Zelenskyy

  
or someone that's aligned with him

  
and that they continue to get
enormous economic and military support

  
from all of the NATO countries

  
So even though I don't think

  
that the energy situation
will become so parlous

  
that it would affect
Putin's decision making

  
I do think that the West's response
does matter on the ground

  
BG The war is kind of having radiating
economic shock waves around the world now

  
ripple effects on food markets
for example and food security

  
We talk a lot about energy security

  
what about food security

  
IB Well you have the largest
grain producer in the world

  
invading the fifth largest
grain producer in the world

  
on the back of a twoyear pandemic
that's still ongoing

  
We don't talk about it much anymore
but it's still there

  
And of course this hit the poorest
countries in the world the hardest

  
The level of indebtedness

  
and the unsustainability
of paying that debt off

  
was already becoming a massive problem

  
for so many of the developing
countries in the world

  
And the IMF provided a lot of relief
in special drawing rights and direct aid

  
over the course of the past  months

  
but that money is now running to an end

  
And what happens
when commodity prices spike up

  
and we have severe supply chain challenges
with energy and food

  
and those things
are obviously very related

  
What happens is that a lot of people die

  
What happens is we see
a lot more starvation

  
The World Food Organization says about 
million people a year die of starvation

  
That number in the next  months
is going to be a lot higher

  
than it otherwise would have been

  
The number of people
who are food stressed in the world

  
is going to go way up
in subSaharan Africa in Yemen

  
in Afghanistan in Bangladesh

  
It's going to go way up

  
And you know
it's horrible to think about

  
but the massive impact
of this Russia crisis

  
is going to be much more
global inequality

  
And this is of course

  
a direct consequence of the end
of the peace dividend more structurally

  
That over the last  years
of globalization

  
what did you have

  
A lot of people were left behind

  
but the biggest thing you had

  
was the explosion of a single
global middle class

  
On the back of the pandemic

  
and now this RussiaUkraine war

  
and the decoupling of the Russian
economy from the West

  
which doesn't matter so much in terms
of the size of the Russian economy

  
but it matters immensely in terms
of commodities globally and supply chain

  
those two things are going
to seriously unwind

  
the growth of this global middle class

  
and they're going to stress developing
countries to a much greater degree

  
They will lead to financial crises
in countries like Turkey for example

  
that will no longer be able
to service their debt

  
You'll see more Lebanons out there

  
You'll see some in Latin America
you'll see some in subSaharan Africa

  
Those are the knockon effects and so

  
so many people that have been saying
over the last few weeks

  
"Why are we paying so much
attention to Ukraine

  
It's because they're white people
because they're European

  
We wouldn't pay that much attention
if they were Afghans

  
or if they were you know Afghanis
or if they were Yemenis

  
We wouldn't"

  
I mean first of all you've got millions
and millions of Ukrainian refugees

  
and we're not paying
as much attention to them

  
as we did to the Syrian refugees
precisely because of race

  
precisely because the Europeans
are more willing to integrate

  
millions and millions
of "fellow Europeans" into Europe

  
But we are paying much more attention
to the Ukraine crisis and we should

  
because the impact on the poorest
people around the world

  
is vastly greater

  
from this conflict
than anything that we've seen

  
in any of those smaller economies
with less impact

  
despite all of the human depredation
that’s happened over the past  years

  
BG Ian I want to talk
for a second about climate

  
because another crisis that has kind of
disappeared from the headlines

  
is the climate crisis right

  
Ten days ago the IPCC released a report

  
that the secretary general
of the UN described

  
as an "atlas of human suffering"

  
if I remember correctly

  
And it has been basically ignored

  
Over the last several years

  
much of the world had started to embark
with more or less enthusiasm

  
on a process of transitioning
away from oil and gas

  
and into kind of a clean energy future

  
And now the war comes in

  
and we look at what you just described
the unraveling of global supply chains

  
the dependency on energy and so on

  
And there are kind of two
schools of thought here

  
One says this war is going to accelerate
the adoption of clean energy

  
because we need to diminish dependence
from Russia and these fossil fuels

  
And the other says
the other school of thought says

  
it's going to derail
the transition to clean energy

  
because suddenly the priority
is no longer decarbonization

  
suddenly the priority
is energy security energy supply

  
IB The Europeans
are largely in the first camp

  
and they will move towards faster
decoupling and investment accordingly

  
The Americans are largely
in the second camp

  
and they will move towards

  
"Let's focus more on fossil fuels
and partisan divide on this issue"

  
accordingly

  
The Chinese

  
who are the largest carbon emitter
in the world by a long margin

  
though not per capita
and not historically

  
but still in terms of every year totals

  
they will continue on the same
path they've been on

  
which is a netzero target

  
but without yet a very strong plan
on how to get there

  
and not feeling a lot of pressure
to provide that plan

  
because they think the Americans
are completely incoherent

  
and incapable of effectuating
a strategic longterm plan

  
on climate themselves

  
So I mean what we have is a lot
of progress on climate and of course

  
technology around renewable energies
and around electric batteries

  
and supply chain

  
continue to get cheaper and cheaper

  
as more money is being invested in it

  
And that does make me longterm
more optimistic that by 

  
a majority of the world's energy
will probably be coming from renewables

  
And five years ago
I wouldn't have said that

  
But still I mean when the news today

  
is that the Americans are sending
a highlevel delegation to Caracas

  
to figure out if we can reopen
relations with Venezuela

  
to get them to produce more oil again

  
With the Iranians

  
let's do any deal possible to get back
into the JCPOA the nuclear deal

  
so that we can get that oil on the market

  
Calling the Saudis calling the Emiratis

  
and they’re not willing to take
Biden’s phone call on this issue

  
while they're talking to Putin

  
Those are warning signals
that in the near term

  
we've got some big challenges

  
and a lot of those challenges are going
to be filled with fossil fuels

  
and fossil fuel development

  
And so I do think that the fact

  
that both of the answers to your question
are true in different places

  
on netnet is more negative
for how quickly we can transition

  
BG Let's talk a bit about China

  
Brigid I think
who’s listening in asks

  
"What do you believe
Xi Jinping is learning

  
from the world's response
to the crisis to the Ukrainian war"

  
IB Well certainly learning that this
was a red line for the West

  
And I think that this
would have surprised

  
it obviously surprised Putin

  
I think it would have surprised
Xi Jinping as well

  
Xi Jinping saw Afghanistan

  
He saw that Merkel was out

  
He saw that Macron is focused
on strategic autonomy

  
He sees Biden as much more focused
on China and Asia

  
I think that this
is a surprise to Xi Jinping

  
But Xi Jinping also sees

  
that a lot of the world
is not with NATO on this issue

  
 countries if I remember correctly

  
voted to censor the Russians
for their invasion of Ukraine

  
at the United Nations General Assembly

  
But very large numbers of that 

  
are not on board with all
of these sanctions against Russia

  
They're happy with the diplomatic censure

  
but they need to continue
to work with the Russians

  
The Chinese see that too

  
The Chinese see just how much more
fragmented the global order is

  
I thought the most significant thing
that we've seen from the Chinese so far

  
two issues

  
The first is of course
when Putin went to Beijing

  
and Xi Jinping made
the public announcement

  
that “this is our best friend
on the global stage

  
and we will work much more strategically
with them economically

  
diplomatically and militarily
going forward"

  
And Xi Jinping knew very well
where Ukraine was heading at that point

  
and also knew that the likelihood
of an invasion was coming

  
Didn't stop him from making
that announcement in the slightest

  
And then after the invasion
and it's going badly

  
I mean if you watch Chinese social media

  
the fact is that the censorship
is all about Ukraine

  
I mean the Chinese media space

  
is pursuing a relentlessly
proPutin policy

  
They have media embedded
with Russian troops

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now publicly the Chinese
government wants to be seen

  
as “We’re neutral we like the Russians

  
we like the Ukrainians

  
we still want to work with everybody"

  
But the fact is that China
feels no problem

  
being publicly completely
aligned with Putin

  
despite the fact that they are invading
a democratic government

  
with  million people
in the middle of Europe

  
That's a pretty astonishing
statement from the Chinese

  
And there's no question
that they have learned

  
that they're in a vastly better
economic position than they used to be

  
and that gives them influence

  
They are a government
who projects its power

  
primarily through economic
and technological means

  
as opposed to Russia that projects it
primarily through military means

  
And the Chinese believe

  
that there is a level of decoupling
that is already going on

  
as the Americans focus
on more industrial policy

  
as they focus on America first
for American workers

  
A US foreign policy for the American
middle class as Biden put it

  
is one that really pushes a lot of capital
to leave a country like China

  
which had served
as the factory for the world

  
but at the expense of a lot of labor

  
coming out of advanced
industrial economies

  
And now yes there are
definitely some dangers

  
that come from the Chinese being perceived
as too close to Russia

  
and they won't want that

  
and they'll want to make sure
that they're engaging diplomatically

  
with the Europeans
to try to minimize that damage

  
But I thought it was very interesting

  
and I'm not sure this is public yet

  
that the Chinese ambassador to Russia
recently in the last few days

  
organized a meeting of a lot
of the top investors

  
Chinese investors in Russia saying

  
"This is a unique opportunity
the West is leaving

  
we should be going in and doing more

  
Because they're going to be completely
reliant on us going forward"

  
That is not a message
that the Chinese ambassador delivers

  
unless he is told
directly to from Beijing

  
BG Ian I'm going to jump
from topic to topic

  
because there are several
questions in the chat

  
Nancy is asking about whether Putin
can be removed from power

  
There's been a lot of discussion lately
about regime change in Russia

  
either endogenous like a palace coup

  
or provoked by sanctions
and other policies

  
And so she asks

  
"How likely is that Putin will face
a challenge from inside Russia

  
whether a popular uprising
a coup or other"

  
IB It's very very unlikely
until it happens

  
(Chuckles)

  
I mean in the sense
that there is absolutely no purpose

  
in trying to say oh I mean you know

  
there are rumors that Defense Minister
Shoigu is unhappy and you know

  
he might be making a move

  
And I’ve seen these
from relatively credible analysts

  
I'm like no no
if there are such rumors

  
then we know it's not happening

  
because that's the end
of Shoigu and his family

  
But it's very clear that there is more
pressure on Putin now

  
than at any point
since he's been president

  
Domestic pressure on Putin

  
About  Russians
have been arrested so far detained

  
most of them have been released

  
for nonviolent antiwar protests

  
The Russians have shut down
all the Western media

  
They've shut down all the Russian
opposition and independent media

  
So Putin has control of the space

  
though if you look at Russian
conversations on Telegram

  
you'll still see a bunch of people
that are seriously seriously antiwar

  
But you know once the economy
starts truly imploding

  
and you can't find goods on shelves
in Russia in major cities

  
and this is coming you know very soon
this is a matter of days

  
in many of these cities

  
those demonstrations
will likely become greater

  
some of them can become violent

  
You know that'll increase the pressure

  
Then you have the issue of how
the Russians are fighting on the ground

  
I mean what happens
if you get a lot of desertions

  
We haven't seen that so far

  
What happens if you get
orders to bomb Kyiv

  
and a whole bunch of Russian
fighter pilots bomber pilots

  
decide not to and they defect
to Poland to Germany

  
That would have a big impact on morale

  
That has not happened so far

  
I mean do be aware of the fact

  
that the Ukrainians are winning
the war on information

  
and that means that the information
that you are getting in the West

  
about the war

  
is much more proUkrainian 

  
morale enthusiasm

  
how well the military is doing 

  
than what's actually
happening on the ground

  
And also be aware of the fact

  
that the Russians completely control
the war on information inside Russia

  
BG Exactly

  
IB They're not getting a balanced view

  
They're getting a completely
proPutin view

  
And most of them actually believe it

  
in the same way that most people
that voted for Trump in the US

  
believe that the election was stolen
and Trump is still president

  
I mean it's much worse
in Russia in that regard

  
than it is in the United States

  
and I think that that's
underappreciated in the West

  
So even though I think there's pressure

  
I really don't think
that it's super likely

  
that Putin is out anytime imminently

  
BG Ed is asking whether you see
any offramp for Putin

  
IB I think that the most likely offramp
for Putin is after Kyiv is taken

  
and Zelenskyy is removed
one way or the other

  
at that point

  
the possibility of the Russians
accepting a frozen conflict

  
or a cease fire that could lead
to ongoing negotiations

  
is a lot higher

  
because Putin can sell that as a win
back home much more easily

  
But also because further
Russian attacks at that point

  
serve much less purpose for the Russians

  
are much harder to bring about

  
and potentially have much more
negative consequences

  
So for me that would be
the nearterm potential break

  
where we could at least freeze issues
largely where they are

  
Now whether that could then eventually
lead to a climbdown or not

  
I mean the Russians have been very happy
with frozen conflicts on their borders

  
for years and years and years

  
I'm thinking about NagornoKarabakh
between Armenia and Azerbaijan

  
which basically stayed in place
until the Azeris

  
over the course of a decade
got enough military capacity

  
that they could forcibly change
the situation on the ground

  
Which by the way the Ukrainians might
also be eventually thinking about

  
because the West will be supplying them
with advanced weapons all the way through

  
I'm thinking South Ossetia in Georgia

  
I'm also of course thinking
about the two pieces of Ukraine

  
they took back in 

  
So be aware of the fact that a negotiation
that creates a cease fire

  
does not mean you're anywhere
close to a resolution

  
or an end of the fighting
that we're seeing

  
BG Someone else in the chat
who didn't sign by his or her name

  
is asking about the nuclear fear
that hangs over the conflict

  
How should we think of that

  
IB Yeah we don't like it
when Putin uses the Nword

  
and there's no question

  
I mean he and his direct reports
have rattled nuclear sabers

  
on at least five times
that I've seen in the past few weeks

  
I think that 

  
In  I wasn't alive
we had the Cuban Missile Crisis

  
There was a real possibility
of nuclear confrontation

  
between the world's two superpowers

  
At least for the last  years
there’s been no chance of that

  
Functionally no chance of that

  
I think we're now back in a world

  
where a Cuban Missile Crisis
is again a reality

  
Now that doesn't mean that I think
nuclear war is likely or imminent

  
I don't

  
And in fact

  
there is active deconfliction
going on even today

  
the Americans and Russians
with a new hotline

  
the secretary general of the UN

  
with the Russian defense minister

  
engaging in deconfliction
measures with UN

  
offices being invited to Moscow

  
So as bad as it is right now

  
people that have been
doing this for a long time

  
are trying to avoid nuclear war

  
But that's the point

  
Is we're now in a situation

  
where the conflict
that we're going to experience

  
needs to be actively managed

  
because of the danger
of nuclear confrontation

  
So it now becomes a risk on the horizon
that we must be continually aware of

  
even if only at a low level

  
as we take and consider further actions

  
as we consider diplomacy

  
as we consider escalation

  
It is now on the table in a way
that frankly is so debilitating

  
I mean as human beings all on this call

  
one of the most painful
things to think about

  
is the fact that we still have
these  nuclear warheads in Russia

  
and  the United States
that are still pointed at each other

  
and they still have the potential
to destroy the planet

  
And we haven't had any real
lessons that we've been able to learn

  
institutionally from 

  
BG  being a generic figure
not the exact figure

  
but we are kind of
in that order of magnitude

  
Then of course there is the question
of civilian nuclear

  
so the two power plants
nuclear power plants

  
that have been seized by the Russians

  
One has been slightly damaged by a bomb

  
the other has been turned off

  
But those are also potentially gigantic
nuclear problems just waiting to happen

  
IB Chemical weapons biological weapons

  
I mean look we have had two million
refugees from Ukraine in two weeks

  
As this continues you're looking
at five to  million refugees

  
I mean it is hard 

  
Just take a step for a moment
just as a human being

  
Imagine what it would take for a quarter
of your country's population

  
to say “I am not living here anymore

  
I am leaving everything
because of the condition of the country

  
because of this unjust war

  
that has been imposed upon you
by your neighbor"

  
That's what we're looking at

  
And again it's important
for us to you know

  
not lose the humanity of this crisis

  
and the extraordinary hardship

  
that is being visited
upon  million Ukrainians

  
that have done nothing wrong
they have committed no sin

  
other than their desire to have
an independent country

  
BG One other country

  
that has not yet taken
a very clear position is India

  
IB Well they're a member of the Quad

  
and their relationship with China
is pretty bad and that’s mutual

  
But in terms of Russia

  
there's been a longstanding relationship

  
trade relationship defense relationship

  
between India and Russia

  
that the Russians
are not going to jettison

  
and they see no reason to jettison it

  
And as long as you've got a whole bunch
of other countries out there

  
that are substantial
that are willing to say

  
we're going to keep playing ball
with the Russians

  
then the Indians will too

  
And that's why you've got the abstention
in the United Nations vote

  
And that's why you've had
very careful comments

  
as opposed to overt
and strong condemnation

  
coming from the Indian leadership

  
BG Phil in the chat is asking

  
"Will this cause a fragmentation
of the financial system

  
with kind of a Western system
and an Eastern system”

  
So two different SWIFTlike systems
two different credit card systems

  
crypto what's the role
of crypto in all this

  
IB I hope not

  
I mean I will tell you
that before the invasion started

  
if you talk to most Western CEOs

  
and I'm talking across
the entire sweep of sectors

  
so it's finance and it's manufacturing
and its services and it's tech

  
most of them would have told you
that they did not in any way plan

  
on reducing their footprint in China

  
and a lot of them said

  
that China was their most important
growth market in the world

  
Not a surprise

  
China is going to be the largest
economy in the world in 

  
So you know a world
that you're decoupling

  
is not a good world

  
when China is going to be
number one economically

  
I mean that obviously
is going to hurt the West in a big way

  
So there are strong
incentives against that

  
and there remain very strong
and powerful entrenched interests

  
in the United States and Europe
that will resist direct decoupling

  
Despite the fact that there are
these more incremental moves

  
towards friendsourcing and insourcing

  
because you know
Chinese labor is more expensive

  
you don’t need as much labor
to get capital moving

  
given robotics

  
and big data deep learning
all of those things

  
But I do think that the Russia conflict

  
risks a level of secondorder decoupling

  
Because if the Russians end up
financially integrated with China

  
in their own

  
notaseffective SWIFT system

  
and all of their energy
ends up going to China

  
and the Chinese build that infrastructure
and they get a discount on it

  
and Russia's technology and their military
industrial complex gets serviced

  
by Chinese semiconductors
and Chinese componentry

  
well I do think that there will be
knockon decoupling

  
that will be longer term
and more strategic

  
from the United States from the Europeans

  
and even from Japan and South Korea

  
So that is a worry

  
and I think the Chinese
are highly aware of that

  
And over the coming months
they will do everything they can

  
both with the Europeans in particular

  
but also I expect at least
with some of the Asian economies

  
to try to limit the impact of that

  
Now keep in mind

  
we haven't talked at all
about Asia yet outside of China

  
The new Japanese Prime Minister Kishida
is at least as hawkish

  
in his orientation towards
China and Russia as Abe was

  
He is providing support
for the Ukrainians

  
including some military capacity 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
He's allowing Ukrainian refugees 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
And yesterday the South Koreans
had a very very tight election

  
and Yoon is now in charge

  
He is on the right and he is the guy
that is strongly antiChina

  
was talking about South Korea
having nuclear capabilities

  
wants a new THAAD missile
defense system for the South Koreans

  
and wants to rebuild
the relationship with Tokyo

  
That matters

  
And that's a big strategic change
in the geopolitical map

  
that will look more problematic
on the decoupling front

  
from Beijing's perspective

  
BG Three final quick questions
that all come from the chat Ian

  
One is because you mentioned
the rest of Asia outside of China

  
"What about the rest of the world

  
What about Africa and Latin America

  
How do they factor into this
conversation or don't they"

  
IB They factor in

  
I mean those that have
significant commodities do well

  
because the prices
are going to be so high

  
Those that don't are going to be
under massive pressure

  
for reasons we already talked about

  
but they are not going to be forced
to pick a side on this one

  
I just don't see it

  
In the same way that if you were Colombia
in the last couple of years

  
you know you found

  
even though you're working very closely
with an American ally

  
you're still dealing with Huawei and G

  
This is knockon effects of all of this

  
These are countries
that are not going to take on

  
significant economic burden

  
given how much they're suffering
right now geopolitically

  
BG Another one is about sanctions

  
How do we even know when and how

  
at what point we start
rolling back sanctions

  
IB I think that as long
as Ukraine is occupied

  
by the Russian government

  
for the foreseeable future
and Putin is there

  
I can't see these sanctions
getting unwound

  
Now if a rump Ukrainian government
that is democratically elected

  
were prepared to sue for peace
and retakes most of Ukraine

  
but they give away Crimea
and they give away the Donbass

  
could you see in that environment
some of these sanctions unwound

  
Sure

  
But I mean I am suggesting

  
that I think that many of these sanctions
are functionally permanent

  
They reflect a new way of doing business

  
And when people ask me
what’s going to happen when this is over

  
my response is what do you mean over

  
What's over is the peace dividend

  
We are now in a new environment

  
BG And one of the figures
of this new environment

  
and I want to close with that
is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine

  
who was not taken very seriously
when he was elected

  
he has come out as a significant
figure in this war

  
What do you make of President Zelenskyy

  
How do you read this character

  
IB He's very courageous

  
I'm obviously inspired by his ability
to communicate and rally his people

  
and take personal risk in Kyiv
while this invasion is going on

  
But I'm very conflicted

  
because I think many of the steps
that Zelenskyy took

  
in the runup to this conflict

  
actually made the likelihood
of conflict worse

  
He was unwilling to take the advice
of the Americans and Europeans seriously

  
in the months leading up to the conflict

  
He was unwilling to mobilize his people

  
to ready them for
the potential of conflict

  
He was certainly unwilling to give an inch

  
in terms of Ukraine's desire
to be a member of NATO

  
even though he knew completely

  
that no one in NATO was prepared
to offer a membership action plan

  
let alone actually
bring them in as members

  
And part of that is a lack of experience

  
and lack of any business
being in that position

  
in the runup to this crisis

  
So I’m very deeply conflicted
in my personal views on Zelenskyy

  
given the way he behaved
before the invasion

  
compared to the extraordinary leadership
that he has displayed to all of us

  
over the last two weeks

  
BG Ian thank you for taking the time

  
for sharing your knowledge
and your analysis with us

  
We deeply appreciate it
Thank you very much

  
IB Good to see all of you

“Turn the tides

  
We must give back”

  
chant my ancestors

  
The thunder strikes 

  
(Hands clap)

  
as the sea demoness 
swept through the lands

  
with a fiery likeness of Letao’s fire

  
Tearing apart livelihood

  
the mounting waves and erosions
leave my island gaping

  
like the mouth of a dead fish

  
Tense muscles of uncles and aunties

  
that hauled cement for the seawall

  
cooked meals for the hungry bellies

  
Release in relief

  
The tides have gone out

  
I look to my grandparents’ graves

  
intimate with limp seaweeds

  
The disrespect

  
(Marshallese) Iakwe nan aolep

  
My name is Selina Leem

  
At  at the COP 

  
alongside late ambassador
for climate change Tony de Brum

  
I introduced myself
as a small island girl with big dreams

  
Five years later I reintroduced myself

  
as a climate warrior from Aelon Kein Ad

  
the Marshall Islands

  
Situated between Hawaii and Australia

  
our chain of islands decorate
the Pacific Ocean like seashells

  
and they are home to about  people

  
Our islands average about
two meters above sea level

  
and it is not uncommon to see
both the ocean and lagoon side

  
from wherever you stand

  
We say our highest point

  
is the bridge which curves
about seven meters above the sea

  
The massive body of water
is our reality and our livelihood

  
With a history of seafaring

  
the ocean connected our islands together

  
as well as providing
many resources to fish

  
to feed

  
and to adorn our handicrafts
with seashells that we make a living from

  
But the climate crisis has brought
calamities to my people

  
threatening our very livelihoods

  
In the Pacific king tide season
is from November to April

  
This is when the tides
are at their highest

  
and each year the sea level rises

  
In these months especially houses
by the seashore end up flooded

  
or damaged completely

  
Schools and churches have had to open
their doors for community members

  
to come sleep at

  
when announcements come in the radio
advising to find shelter

  
because of incoming tides

  
And we huddled together
with our blankets and pillows

  
no matter that we are strangers
as we sleep next to one another

  
Seawalls are rebuilt
as soon as it’s low tide

  
only to be broken down again

  
by the waves that grow higher each year

  
And these waves

  
their path continues on into the islands

  
bringing with it garbage
we’ve thrown into it

  
You see the graves of your loved ones
submerged in water

  
littered

  
Then the vegetation starts to brown;

  
it is dying

  
The soil becomes salinated

  
You pray the bigger trees hold on

  
for their roots are needed
to prevent further erosion

  
In the most effected parts of the lands

  
the land has regressed

  
coming closer and closer
to the road each year

  
Our driest part of the year happens
within this time period too

  
We are unable to use groundwater well
because it becomes saltier as well

  
In the capital Majuro once per week

  
water is dispensed

  
and my neighbors and I fill up our tanks

  
our water catchments

  
our bottles and our buckets

  
Our government has had to declare
a state of national emergency

  
calling for help from our friends

  
Sealevel rising

  
flooding

  
droughts

  
erosion have been the reality
of my people for many many many years

  
We’ve been told to move

  
To become climate change refugees

  
I’m not even sure
who would even take us in

  
But to those who think
that we can just accept our fate

  
I want to say

  
Adaptation and Indigenous knowledge 
are the solutions

  
These islands are our ancestors

  
our predecessors

  
our homes

  
We are at the risk of losing all of that

  
for something we contributed
very very little to

  
Raising and expanding the islands
is something my country is thinking of

  
However we don’t have the resources
nor the infrastructure

  
Regardless

  
we remain adamant

  
We continue to fight for our livelihoods

  
and not abandon our home

  
Thank you

It’s the morning of June th 

  
and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic  kilometer journey

  
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather

  
flying an average of  kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight

  
Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the DDay invasion back to England

  
He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment

  
Paddy was one of around  pigeons

  
used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages

  
In fact pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices

  
Seeing their meat as a protein source

  
and their nitrogenrich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer

  
humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as  years ago

  
We then tapped into other traits

  
Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct

  
that drives them to navigate
long distances

  
back to the location they consider “home”

  
So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing

  
In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying”

  
people selected for traits 
like head plumage

  
and fabulously feathered feet

  
As we carried pigeons around the world
they escaped or were released

  
forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today

  
Pigeons are now one of the most abundant
widespread species on the planet

  
managing to thrive in chaotic cities

  
They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits

  
including some that were
accentuated by humans

  
Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees

  
pigeons were originally cliffdwellers

  
City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat

  
And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking

  
Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass

  
and it's a great spot to raise babies

  
This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments

  
where more specialized species can’t

  
As generalists pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste

  
With an organ in their throats 
called a crop

  
they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later

  
They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food

  
Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and proteinrich meal

  
If conditions are right
pigeons breed yearround

  
and produce new offspring every six weeks

  
They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities

  
because of the abundance 
of food and shelter

  
These booming populations 
attract predators

  
New York City is home 
to a million pigeons

  
which support large populations
of raptors

  
But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight

  
further exploited by being bred
for racing

  
means they’re made 
for high speed chases

  
Compared to barn owls
which are a similar size

  
pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved

  
providing extra space for muscle mass

  
They can reach speeds 
of  kilometers per hour

  
And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout

  
While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife

  
we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors

  
In  New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings”

  
and it stuck

  
Indeed their poop

  
which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer presents a unique problem

  
Just one pigeon can leave behind 
 kilograms of acidic excrement per year

  
which in the United States 
scales to about $ billion

  
in structural damage annually

  
Though incidents of infection are rare

  
this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled

  
They may be numerous noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch

  
but the pigeons that swirl around us

  
are evidence of an ancient 
ongoing relationship

  
Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort

  
For better or for worse 
we did this to ourselves

  
The world can be a toxic place

  
No one knows this more
than women and girls

  
cis and trans

  
as well as nonbinary people

  
I am a journalist

  
with  years’ experience

  
reporting on the injustices women
and others face around the world

  
I’m a cofounder of the Man Up Campaign

  
to energize youth activism
against sexual and genderbased violence

  
I’m a father to two daughters

  
I’m a life partner to a woman

  
and I’m a Black man in America

  
Holding these identities 

  
and many more 

  
I say this call to action to you

  
with the deepest sincerity

  
and utmost gravity

  
It is time for a gender reckoning

  
beginning with men authentically
confronting our internal selves

  
and each other

  
through the toxicity within us

  
Against the backdrop
of Black Lives Matter protest

  
cries for a racial reckoning
have echoed throughout the world

  
at times seeming premature

  
and largely misunderstood

  
I believe a true gender reckoning
must be the center

  
of any transformative movement
for social justice and equity

  
But what is a reckoning

  
Dictionaries say it means
to resolve a bill or a debt

  
In other words to settle an account

  
In the case of women and girls

  
what is the debt owed to them

  
Who’s to pay it

  
And how

  
The consequences of male toxicity
continue building

  
the debt to which I refer

  
including among others

  
a gender wealth gap most affecting women
who care for their families

  
as well as act as the primary
income generators

  
for their households

  
Today in the United States and abroad

  
threats to reproductive justice endanger
the lives and hardfought rights of women

  
in regards to their bodily
sexual and gender autonomy

  
impacting the most disenfranchised
community in society

  
And violence against women

  
in all of its forms

  
still represents
an existential challenge

  
as we’ve seen domestic violence
rise in the pandemic

  
as people were confined to their homes

  
we’ve seen online and public
harassment flourish

  
unabated

  
The sexual trafficking

  
prostitution

  
exploitation of women and girls
thrives as ever before

  
From where does this toxicity come

  
and why

  
Men are not endangered

  
we’re not under assault

  
we’re not being unfairly maligned

  
In fact it’s men or certain types of
masculinity that are the issue

  
To be clear

  
being a man does not make me

  
or anyone else who identifies as a man

  
inherently toxic

  
But masculinity

  
in certain forms

  
can harm women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
and men

  
through violence

  
dominating power

  
and control

  
So how do we address this

  
How can we men step up

  
and better support our daughters

  
our sisters

  
our female partners

  
our colleagues neighbors and friends

  
Through what means can men both instigate
and lead a gender reckoning

  
First we must tell the truth

  
We must tell the truth

  
Men grow into this world
becoming who we’re expected to be

  
or who we think we’re expected to be

  
based on cultural expectations

  
and inaccurate historical narratives

  
As a short chubby Black kid
wearing glasses growing up

  
I was repeatedly told I cried too much

  
I’m too emotional

  
too soft

  
It was ingrained in me
that to prove my masculinity

  
I had to display physical prowess 

  
intimidation

  
Because of that indoctrination

  
as an adult

  
I refused to seek help
facing escalating health challenges

  
including high blood pressure

  
and mental trauma

  
The archetype of manhood nearly killed me

  
I say that as a survivor
of two heart attacks

  
four years on dialysis

  
and a kidney transplant 

  
aside from the physical risk
I put myself into

  
covering wars around the world

  
The injury we do to ourselves

  
and the women around us

  
comes from fear of losing control

  
of lack of external affirmation

  
and simply out of shame

  
Manhood is a spectrum of identities

  
There is no one way to be a man

  
And sometimes discovering one’s true
manhood is a lifelong journey

  
Secondly

  
we must be consistent

  
Men

  
especially men of color

  
cannot expect women to stand up for us

  
with us in the face
of systemic oppressions

  
when too often we do not
do the same for them

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
(Applause)

  
The Black Lives Matter
movement for example

  
founded named and led
by queer women of color

  
still centers Black men’s wellbeing

  
in the face of unfair policing

  
and criminal justice systems

  
And where’s the reciprocal
support from those men

  
including myself

  
in addressing intercommunity violence
against women of color

  
maternal health inequity

  
economic disparity

  
How and where do men show up for women

  
I wonder 

  
how many men stood with women
on the steps of the US Supreme Court

  
as they fought for reproductive rights

  
How many men should have been there

  
Finally there can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
There can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
Men who commit acts of violence against
women must be held accountable

  
by formal systems of justice

  
as well as other men

  
Silence in the face of misogynistic
behavior and language is complicity

  
We men need to break free from the pack

  
take concrete actions to stop violence

  
create safety

  
and build equity

  
And most importantly

  
say something

  
To be sure

  
bold men around us are actively working
to disrupt the narrative of male toxicity

  
After the  earthquake in Haiti

  
a local organization

  
KOFAVIV

  
invited men to be defenders of women
and girls in displacement camps

  
women and girls who were
at risk of sexual assault

  
Scores of men answered the call

  
and can continue to do so today

  
In New York City

  
CONNECT NYC

  
led by a Black man

  
actively engages community partners
across civil society

  
to address family violence

  
And in a profession not known generally
for its advocacy against gender violence

  
a professional player
for the Washington Football Team

  
has become an unabashed advocate

  
for men to learn

  
and actively change behaviors
regarding sexual and physical violence

  
There is hope;

  
there is light

  
Men around the world
are putting in the work

  
to catalyze a true gender reckoning

  
But far more are needed

  
What I want to say to you today is this

  
Too many of us 

  
too many men 

  
don’t understand

  
that equity

  
justice

  
inclusivity

  
safety for women girls
and nonbinary people

  
serves and saves us all

  
Broken masculinity harms societies

  
full stop

  
When we men reckon with that truth

  
we will finally find our shared humanity

  
Women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
men

  
standing together on equal footing

  
with mutual respect

  
in safe environments

  
is the greatest
gender reckoning we can create

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Imagine a scientist

  
who wants to send a robot
to explore in a faraway place

  
a place whose geography
might be completely unknown

  
and perhaps inhospitable

  
Now imagine that instead
of first designing that robot

  
and sending it off in the hope
that it might be suitable

  
instead she sends
a robotproducing technology

  
that figures out what kind of robot
is needed once it arrives

  
builds it and then enables it
to continue to evolve

  
to adapt to its new surroundings

  
It’s exactly what my collaborators
and I are working on

  
a radical new technology
which enables robots to be created

  
reproduce and evolve
over long periods of time

  
a technology where robot design
and fabrication becomes a task

  
for machines rather than humans

  
Robots are already all around us
in factories in hospitals in our home

  
But from an engineer's perspective

  
designing a shelfstacking robot
or a Roomba to clean our home

  
is relatively straightforward

  
We know exactly what they need to do

  
and we can imagine the kind of situations
they might find themselves in

  
So we design with this in mind

  
But what if we want
to send that robot to operate

  
in a place that we have little
or even no knowledge about

  
For example cleaning up legacy waste
inside a nuclear reactor

  
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
mining for minerals deep in a trench
at the bottom of the ocean

  
or exploring a faraway asteroid

  
How frustrating would it be
if the humandesigned robot

  
that had taken years
to get to the asteroid

  
suddenly found it needed to drill a hole

  
to collect a sample or clamber up a cliff

  
but it didn't have the right tools

  
or the right means of locomotion to do so

  
If instead we had a technology

  
that enabled the robots to be designed
and optimized in situ

  
in the environment
in which they need to live and work

  
then we could potentially save
years of wasted effort

  
and produce robots
that are uniquely adapted

  
to the environments
that they find themselves in

  
So to realize this technology
we've been turning to nature for help

  
All around us

  
we see examples of biological species

  
that have evolved smart adaptations

  
that enable them to thrive
in a given environment

  
For example in the Cuban rainforest

  
we find vines that have evolved leaves

  
that are shaped like
humandesigned satellite dishes

  
These leaves direct bats to their flowers

  
by amplifying the signals
that the bats send out

  
therefore improving pollination

  
What if we could create
an artificial version of evolution

  
that would enable robots
to evolve in a similar manner

  
as biological organisms

  
I'm not talking about biomimicry

  
a technology which simply copies
what's observed in nature

  
What we're hoping to harness
is the creativity of evolution

  
to discover designs
that are not observed here on Earth

  
the human engineer
might not have thought of

  
or even be capable of conceiving

  
In theory

  
this evolutionary design technology
could operate completely autonomously

  
in a faraway place

  
But equally it could be guided by humans

  
Just as we breed plants for qualities
such as drought resistance or taste

  
the human robot breeder could guide
artificial evolution to producing robots

  
with specific qualities

  
For example

  
the ability to squeeze
through a narrow gap

  
or perhaps operate at low energy

  
This idea of artificial evolution
imitating biological evolution

  
using a computer program

  
to breed better and better solutions
to problems over time

  
isn't actually new

  
In fact artificial evolution

  
algorithms operating inside a computer

  
have been used to design everything
from tables to turbine blades

  
Back in 

  
NASA even sent a satellite into space
with a communication antenna

  
that had been designed
by artificial evolution

  
But evolving robots
is actually much harder

  
than evolving passive objects
such as tables

  
because robots need brains
as well as bodies

  
in order to make sense of the information
in the world around them

  
and translate that
into appropriate behaviors

  
So how do we do it

  
Surprisingly evolution only needs
three ingredients

  
a population of individuals which
exhibit some physical variations;

  
a method of reproduction

  
in which offspring inherit
some traits from their parents

  
and occasionally acquire
new ones via mutation;

  
and finally a means of natural selection

  
So we can replicate these three
ingredients to evolve robots

  
using a mixture of hardware and software

  
The first task is to design
a digital version of DNA

  
That is a digital blueprint that describes
the robot's brain its body

  
its sensory mechanisms
and its means of locomotion

  
Using a randomly generated
set of these blueprints

  
we can create an initial population
of  or more robots

  
to kickstart this evolutionary process

  
We've designed a technology
that can take the digital blueprint

  
and turn it into a physical robot
without any need for human assistance

  
For example it uses a D printer
to print the skeleton of the robot

  
and then an automated assembly arm
like you might find in a factory

  
to add any electronics and moving parts

  
including a small computer
that acts as a brain

  
And to enable this brain to adapt
to the new body of the robot

  
we send every robot produced
to an equivalent of a kindergarten

  
a place where the newborn robot
can refine its motor skills

  
almost like a small child would

  
To mimic natural selection

  
we score these robots
on the ability to conduct a task

  
And then we use these scores

  
to selectively decide
which robots get to reproduce

  
The reproduction mechanism

  
mixes the digital DNA
of the chosen parent robots

  
to create a new blueprint
for a child robot

  
that inherits some of the
characteristics from its parents

  
but occasionally also
exhibits some new ones

  
And by repeating the cycle of selection
and reproduction over and over again

  
we hope that we can breed
successive generations of robots

  
where just like is often observed
in biological evolution

  
each generation gets better than the last

  
with the robots gradually optimizing
their form and their behavior

  
to the task and the environment
that they find themselves in

  
Now although this can all take place

  
in a time frame that's much faster
than biological evolution

  
which sometimes takes thousands of years

  
it's still relatively slow in terms
of the time frames we might expect

  
in our modern world

  
to design and produce an artifact

  
It's mainly due
to the D printing process

  
which can take more
than four hours per robot

  
depending on the complexity
and the shape of the robot

  
But we can give our artificial
evolutionary process a helping hand

  
to reduce the number of physical robots
that we actually need to make

  
We create a digital copy
of every robot produced

  
inside a simulation in a computer

  
and we allow this virtual
population of robots to evolve

  
Now it's quite likely that the simulation
isn't a very accurate representation

  
of the real world

  
But it has an advantage that it enables
models of robots to be created

  
and tested in seconds rather than hours

  
So using the simulator technology

  
we can quickly explore the potential
of a wide range of robot types

  
of different shapes and sizes
of different sensory configurations

  
and quickly get a rough estimate
of how useful each robot may be

  
before we physically make it

  
And we predict that by allowing
a novel form of breeding

  
in which a physical robot can breed
with one of its virtual cousins

  
then the useful traits
that have been discovered in simulation

  
will quickly spread into
the physical robot population

  
where they can be further refined in situ

  
It might sound like science fiction

  
but actually there's a serious point

  
While we expect the technology
that I've just described

  
to be useful in designing robots

  
for example to work in situations
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
or to help us pursue our scientific quest
for exoplanetary exploration

  
there are some more pragmatic reasons

  
why we should consider
artificial evolution

  
As climate change gathers pace

  
it is clear that we need a radical rethink

  
to our approach to robotic
design here on Earth

  
in order to reduce
that ecological footprint

  
For example

  
creating new designs of robot
built from sustainable materials

  
that operate at low energy

  
that are repairable and recyclable

  
It's quite likely that this
new generation of robots

  
won't look anything like the robots
that we see around us today

  
but that's exactly why
artificial evolution might help

  
Discovering novel designs by processes
that are unfettered by the constraints

  
that our own understanding
of engineering science

  
imposes on the design process

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Around the globe

  
there are approximately  million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

  
to escape war violence and persecution

  
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons

  
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries

  
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries

  
They are commonly referred to as refugees

  
But what exactly does that term mean

  
The world has known refugees 
for millennia

  
but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's  Convention

  
relating to the status of refugees

  
in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War

  
It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality

  
and is unable to return 
to their home country

  
because of wellfounded fears
of being persecuted

  
That persecution may be due to their race
religion nationality

  
membership in a particular social group
or political opinion

  
and is often related to war and violence

  
Today roughly half the world's refugees
are children

  
some of them unaccompanied by an adult

  
a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor

  
or sexual exploitation

  
Each refugee's story is different

  
and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes

  
But before we get 
to what their journeys involve

  
let's clear one thing up

  
There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms

  
"migrant" and "refugee"

  
"Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country

  
for reasons not related to persecution

  
such as searching 
for better economic opportunities

  
or leaving droughtstricken areas
in search of better circumstances

  
There are many people around the world
who have been displaced

  
because of natural disasters

  
food insecurities

  
and other hardships

  
but international law rightly or wrongly

  
only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees

  
So what happens when someone
flees their country

  
Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous

  
with limited access to shelter
water or food

  
Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected

  
belongings might be left behind

  
and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents

  
like visas to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries

  
Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling

  
by standard routes

  
This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea

  
and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers

  
to help them cross borders

  
Whereas some people seek safety
with their families

  
others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind

  
with the hopes of being reunited later

  
This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long

  
While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities

  
sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp

  
usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments

  
Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures

  
offering shortterm shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home

  
be integrated to the host country

  
or resettle in another country

  
But resettlement and longterm 
integration options are often limited

  
So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years

  
and sometimes even decades

  
Once in a new country the first legal
step for a displaced person

  
is to apply for asylum

  
At this point they are an asylum seeker

  
and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted

  
While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee

  
every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum

  
and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee

  
Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially

  
Host countries have several duties

  
towards people they have 
recognized as refugees

  
like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and nondiscrimination

  
The most basic obligation towards refugees
is nonrefoulement

  
a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual

  
to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened

  
In reality however refugees are
frequently the victims

  
of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment

  
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia

  
and racism

  
And all too often they aren't permitted
to enter the work force

  
and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid

  
In addition far too many refugee children
are out of school

  
due to lack of funding 
for education programs

  
If you go back in your own family history

  
chances are you will discover that
at a certain point

  
your ancestors were forced 
from their homes

  
either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution

  
It would be good of us to remember
their stories

  
when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced

  
searching for a new home

  
We're going to have hotter
drier summers in our cities

  
We're going to have to deal
with more frequent and intense heat waves

  
It's going to have an impact
on our health and wellbeing

  
but not just us

  
What about the plants and animals
that call our cities home

  
So what could we do about that

  
We could green our cities
we could plant trees

  
The shade provided by trees
provides protection

  
from those impacts of the heat

  
But what do we need to make
those plants thrive and survive

  
We need water

  
Our green cities need water
but mosquitoes also like water

  
And so how can we balance the impacts
that come from both of those

  
if we perhaps are inadvertently
creating increasing pests

  
and public health risks for ourselves

  
in the ways in which we try to respond
to a changing climate

  
How can we green our cities
and not create a problem with mosquitoes

  
The mosquito is the deadliest
animal on the planet

  
About half a million people die every year
because of mosquito bite

  
Diseases such as malaria and dengue

  
infect hundreds of millions
of people every year across the planet

  
That burden of disease
weighs quite heavily

  
on both communities and local authorities

  
as they struggle to try to deal
with those impacts

  
Here in Australia
we're very fortunate to be free

  
of some of the more serious
mosquitoborne diseases

  
but there are still pathogens
spread by local mosquitoes

  
that can make us sick

  
So something like Ross River virus

  
If we get infected with this virus
we may not die

  
but we could get seriously ill

  
Fever rash joint pain fatigue 

  
We could be battling illness
for many months

  
But notwithstanding the burden of disease

  
what about the nuisance that mosquitoes
can have just to our daytoday lives

  
How many of you have been
bothered by mosquitoes

  
when you're outside enjoying the barbecue

  
or visiting the local wetlands
during summer

  
What about that mosquito
that buzzes around your bedroom at night

  
How can we manage these risks
and move forward

  
and try to live in a greener city

  
and not create opportunities
for mosquitoes

  
So I spend my summers
sloshing about in wetlands

  
wrangling mosquitoes

  
Despite the sunburn
and the mosquito bites and the mud

  
I actually do quite like my job

  
And I've also got a confession
to make to you all 

  
I actually quite like mosquitoes

  
(Laughter)

  
I'm quite fascinated by them

  
I think they're actually quite beautiful

  
if you get a chance to look at them
underneath the microscope

  
So before I started my research

  
and first looked through
a microscope at a mosquito

  
I don't think I'd really given them
much of a thought

  
I knew that they were involved
in outbreaks of disease overseas

  
and I was quite familiar with that smell
of a smoldering mosquito coil

  
It still reminds me of summer holidays

  
But the work I do now

  
together with that of scientists
around the country

  
is trying to work out how we can
stop people getting sick

  
because of mosquito bites

  
It requires us to understand

  
the role that mosquitoes have
in our local environment

  
and how we can change our cities

  
so that we're greening our cities

  
we're mitigating those impacts
of climate change

  
but at the same time not creating
opportunities for mosquitoes

  
Did you know there are over 
different types of mosquitoes

  
that are found in Western Sydney

  
So it's not just that one mosquito
that you slap on your arm and squash;

  
they're an incredibly diverse
and interesting range of animals

  
There's  different types
across Western Sydney

  
These mosquitoes might be big
they might be small

  
They might be black
with distinctively striped legs

  
They might be a pale brown color

  
Or they might be
a really vibrant orange color

  
But one of the things I love
about all of these mosquitoes

  
is that they're very unique

  
they've adapted to very different
types of environment

  
It’s one of the reasons that I like them
because they’re incredibly adaptive

  
But it’s also the thing
that worries me about them

  
because they could be adapting
to these sources of water

  
we're creating around our cities

  
So mosquitoes are found in an incredibly
wide range of environments

  
from coastal rock pools

  
to snowmelt streams in our Alpine regions

  
from polluted drains to pristine wetlands

  
and almost every puddle
of water in between

  
There are mosquitoes found
in all of these environments

  
And understanding how the mosquitoes
interact with these environments

  
and the climate

  
is really important to understand
how they might play a role

  
in outbreaks of disease

  
But all of these mosquitoes
essentially need two things

  
they need blood and they need water

  
So I'll get to the blood
in a little while

  
but let me talk to you about why water
is really important for mosquitoes

  
The humble mossie is a really frail
and fragile creature

  
Looks like it'll fall apart
in a strong breeze

  
It's hard to imagine these are the most
dangerous animals on the planet

  
But these animals kind of rely on water;

  
they've got an amazing life cycle
that starts in the water

  
They need water

  
So eggs are laid in and around
sources of water

  
and then when it rains
or tides come into the wetlands

  
these eggs hatch and out of these eggs
hatch these wormlike larvae

  
that swim around in the water

  
Maybe you’ve seen them in puddles
or your pot plant saucers

  
Or maybe as I did as a child

  
if you're a bit slow to clean
your backyard swimming pool

  
when warmer weather arrives

  
all of a sudden
you can see these mosquitoes

  
swimming around at the top of the water

  
But during summer
it might only take a week or so

  
for them to emerge from that water
and start flying around

  
They only live for a few weeks

  
but during that time
they can bite a lot of people

  
and they can lay
more than a thousand eggs

  
But to get those eggs they need blood

  
Mosquitoes need blood
that's why they bite

  
It's only the female mosquito that bites

  
and she needs that protein hit
in her blood to develop her eggs

  
They can live quite happily on plant
juices and sugars most of the time

  
but they really need
that blood to develop eggs

  
And the animals they can get
that blood from can be incredibly varied

  
from cows and kangaroos
to birds to frogs

  
But also us

  
And I know some of us in this room
you're probably thinking

  
"Boy mosquitoes sure like to bite me

  
more than they like to bite my friends"

  
And sometimes we can be
a bit unlucky like that

  
But it's also important to remember
that mosquitoes when they bite

  
can not only create
an itchy red lump on our skin

  
but they can also make us sick

  
They can transmit pathogens
that make us sick

  
But mosquitoes aren’t flying around

  
transferring droplets of infected blood
from person to person

  
These are not dirty syringes;

  
they’re much more complicated organisms

  
So the mosquitoes themselves
have to become infected with the pathogen

  
before they can pass that on to us

  
And when it comes
to pathogen transmission

  
not all mosquitoes are created equal

  
It's why it's really important
to understand mosquitoes

  
because even though we have dozens
of mosquitoes here in Sydney

  
that could transmit
something like Ross River virus

  
there are no mosquitoes
currently in Sydney

  
that can transmit the pathogens
that cause more serious diseases

  
things like dengue chikungunya or Zika

  
Let's hope it stays that way

  
So what does a green city
look like for a mosquito

  
So first of all there are trees
that provide shade

  
protection from wind and sun 

  
It provides these kind of protected
humid little areas

  
where mosquitoes can take refuge

  
The longer mosquitoes live

  
the more people they bite

  
the more eggs they lay

  
But it’s not so much the plants
but the water they need

  
which is really critical for mosquitoes

  
So in a green city we have water tanks

  
we build wetlands

  
We’ve got green walls and frog ponds

  
We’ve got bioretention basins

  
We’ve got rain gardens

  
All of these structures that might be
designed to store and recycle water

  
in and around our cities and suburbs

  
could be used by mosquitoes

  
Remember mosquitoes love this water
that's available to them

  
So how can we design our cities

  
so that mosquitoes aren't quick to adapt
to these types of environments

  
Wherever there's water
mosquitoes will lay eggs

  
and we have to be mindful about that
as we try to respond and green our cities

  
create the structures that will help us

  
It'll make a city greater

  
I want to live in a green city

  
I would love to live in a green city;

  
it's probably great for my physical
and mental health and wellbeing

  
I just don't want to share that
with too many mosquitoes

  
And mosquitoes are so adaptive

  
that I'm sure that they're going
to create opportunities

  
in these structures that we're building

  
and so I'm really worried

  
that we're going to see
more and more mosquitoes into the future

  
So how do you create a wetland
that's not home to mosquitoes

  
One of the really interesting pieces
of research we've found in recent years

  
is that problematic mosquito populations

  
often seem to be associated
with wetlands of poor health

  
wetlands that have more stagnant water

  
wetlands that don't have enough predators
to eat the mosquitoes

  
So it’s a tantalizing idea

  
that if you can create
a wetland that's healthier

  
it has more water flow

  
it has a greater level of biodiversity

  
you can actually keep
mosquito populations down

  
If you provide habitats
for the animals that eat mosquitoes 

  
the birds the bats
the fish the frogs the spiders

  
any number of aquatic insects
that love munching on mosquitoes 

  
rather than being a problem

  
mosquitoes are not going to disappear

  
we're not going to get rid
of mosquitoes completely

  
but if they're at a more balanced
place in the ecosystem

  
maybe we'll have fewer pest impacts

  
and more importantly

  
maybe we will see less
mosquitoborne disease

  
But what about stormwater drains

  
These are already a common sight
in our local wetlands

  
and there's a mosquito
that calls these habitats home

  
which you all already know

  
You may not notice it
when it flies past you

  
but you know its sound

  
You've probably learned to hate
the sound of this mosquito

  
more so than its bite

  
This is a mosquito called
the brown house mosquito

  
It loves breeding in polluted ponds
and pipes and waterways;

  
it's going to be quick to exploit

  
the ways in which we store
wastewater in our cities

  
The thing is about this mosquito

  
is that it loves coming indoors at night

  
It's the mosquito that's going to be
buzzing around your face at night

  
keep you awake disrupting your sleep

  
Now the reason you can hear that mosquito

  
is not because it makes a sound
that's different to any other mosquito

  
It's just that a mosquito
prefers to bite birds

  
and so it's flying
around your face and your body

  
responding to your heat
and the smell of your skin working out

  
"Is this a large featherless bird

  
I'm not sure whether
I want to bite it or not"

  
It's bad luck for those of you
who smell a bit like a bird

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's a reminder that sometimes

  
it's not just the bite of mosquitoes
that's the problem

  
it's the disturbance that can be caused
by large numbers of mosquitoes

  
And so we don't want these mosquitoes
coming inside our homes

  
where we're kind of creating opportunities
for these mosquitoes in our cities

  
So what about our backyards

  
We all want to keep our backyards healthy

  
we want to have a great opportunity
for our plants and our pets

  
and the local wildlife

  
One effective way to do that
is installing a rainwater tank

  
Problem is rainwater tanks
can be a great source

  
for very serious mosquitoes

  
You all in this room
have probably been bitten

  
by the Australian backyard mosquito

  
Its scientific name is Aedes notoscriptus

  
It is the most widespread
mosquito in Australia;

  
almost everybody has opportunities
for this mosquito in their backyard

  
Whether it's a birdbath
a pot plant saucer

  
even the smallest volumes of water
trapped in a waterholding container

  
will be a place this mosquito
can lay its eggs

  
It's a nuisance biting pest

  
but it's not a serious threat
to our health

  
But there's a problem here

  
because these same habitats
where this mosquito is found

  
could also be the home of a mosquito

  
that's associated with the transmission
of much more serious pathogens

  
pathogens that can cause
outbreaks of disease

  
such as dengue chikungunya and Zika

  
These mosquitoes
are the Asian tiger mosquito

  
or the yellow fever mosquito

  
These two mosquitoes are not found
in Sydney at the moment

  
but worldwide they contribute to major
outbreaks of mosquitoborne disease

  
They don't breed in wetlands

  
they love these waterholding
containers in our backyards

  
And as we do a better job
of creating these opportunities

  
like rainwater tanks in our backyards

  
maybe we're creating an opportunity
for these mosquitoes to move in

  
The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti

  
was actually once common in Sydney

  
but during the 's it disappeared

  
One of the reasons for its disappearance

  
could well have been the fact
that we moved away from rainwater tanks

  
And now rainwater tanks are coming back

  
They're going to become more common

  
And could that see the return
of these mosquitoes

  
I certainly hope not

  
So what can authorities do
about reducing the mosquitoes

  
associated with these greening cities
that we're dealing with

  
There's a role for our local authorities

  
to consider mosquitoes
when they're building wetlands

  
creating wastewater recycling schemes

  
regulating the installation
of rainwater tanks

  
Because these are dynamic systems

  
It's not just about
how you design them and build them

  
but it's how you maintain them

  
You can't just build them and walk away

  
because as we've learned

  
if these habitats degrade
they become more suitable for mosquitoes

  
These types of structures

  
these wetlands
in our cities they're great

  
They help reduce pollution
they help store water

  
but we don't want them to become
an opportunity for mosquitoes

  
But what about us

  
There's a role for local government
for our local authorities

  
but how an we help protect
our families and our friends

  
from the impact of mosquitoes
associated with a greening city

  
I'm going to leave you with three tips

  
that can help you stop
the bite of mosquitoes

  
and the buzz of mosquitoes this summer

  
First of all

  
don't create opportunities
for mosquitoes in your backyard

  
Anything that traps water after rainfall
will be a source of mosquitoes

  
so tip out cover up or remove
these waterholding containers

  
in your backyard

  
Screen your rainwater tanks

  
Clean your gutters and your drains

  
reduce that standing water
that mosquitoes love so much

  
around our homes

  
Secondly

  
insect repellents are a safe
and effective way

  
to avoid mosquito bites

  
When you're choosing a formulation

  
from the local pharmacy
or the supermarket

  
make sure you apply it
as a nice even coat

  
over all exposed areas of skin

  
Don't put it on like perfume

  
A dab here or there
is not going to provide protection

  
Unless you've got complete cover
those mosquitoes will find a way

  
to find that gap
in your repellent and bite

  
Lastly a way that you might be able
to stop the buzz of mosquitoes

  
Why not just switching on a fan

  
We know that operating a fan in a bedroom
can help reduce those mosquitoes

  
that come in and buzz around
our ears at night

  
It disperses the smells
and the temperatures

  
around that body that attracts them;

  
it might make it a bit harder
for that mossie

  
to fly around and find us as well

  
So finally I want to leave you
with a thought

  
We may hate mosquitoes and I understand

  
I don’t want to convert you
into loving these bloodsuckers

  
But we need to understand them

  
Because if we can’t understand
the diversity of mosquitoes

  
and their relationships
with the environments

  
we’re creating in our green cities

  
it's going to become
a much greater struggle

  
to kind of reduce the burden of disease
that might come with them

  
And unfortunately

  
mosquitoes are going to be
yet another challenge we face

  
as we move forward into our future cities

  
under the impact of a changing climate

  
As a new widow Sarah Rosas Garcia

  
was already struggling to support
her nine children

  
when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities

  
Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school

  
and being sexually promiscuous

  
so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents

  
committed her to a state hospital

  
After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score

  
the doctors made their verdict

  
They told Sara her yearold daughter
would be sterilized

  
to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency

  
This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime

  
But in fact it took place 
in Southern California in 

  
And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color

  
targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics

  
Since ancient Greece there have been
efforts to control human populations

  
via reproduction retaining some
traits and removing others

  
But in the th century the discovery
of evolution and genetics

  
inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor

  
In  British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton

  
named this idea eugenics

  
drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born”

  
This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists

  
and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society

  
by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down

  
However their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable

  
was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era

  
Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction

  
including immigrants people of color
and people with disabilities

  
Meanwhile their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members

  
white Europeans
of Nordic or AngloSaxon descent

  
As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early th century

  
many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions

  
These measures to improve socalled
“racial hygiene”

  
were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany

  
The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews

  
as well as individuals from other groups

  
including Roma gay men 
and people with disabilities

  
Outside their extreme brutality however

  
Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe

  
Throughout the midth century

  
many countries enacted eugenics policies

  
and governments in Sweden 
Canada and Japan

  
forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals

  
Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US

  
From  to 

  
US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over  people

  
with  states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization

  
for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective”

  
This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses

  
and the results of IQ tests

  
which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations

  
These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California

  
From  to  Latina women were 
% more likely to be sterilized

  
than other women

  
And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high—

  
this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations

  
Such was the case of Andrea Garcia

  
whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates

  
With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus

  
Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law

  
violated the US Constitution

  
depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law

  
However while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea

  
the other two did not

  
Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery

  
but many more victims 
of these policies did not

  
Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations

  
after the horrors of World War II

  
many of its practices including
sterilization continued for decades

  
By the late s research 
into human genetics was more nuanced

  
and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence

  
Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization

  
well into the s

  
Finally class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers

  
and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 

  
Unfortunately today

  
the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities

  
still continues around the globe

  
Anna Malaika Tubbs "The Three Mothers"

  
is about Alberta King
Berdis Baldwin and Louise Little

  
the mothers of MLK Jr
James Baldwin and Malcolm X

  
And I wrote this book

  
to not only celebrate
these three incredible life stories

  
that we should have known
for years and years before my book

  
but to also think about what their stories
could symbolize for Black women

  
Black mothers mothers more generally

  
and what it could mean
to save their stories

  
from being forgotten from being erased

  
and how it changes our understanding
of where we are as a nation today

  
how we have arrived here

  
what are changes
that we still need to make

  
Whitney Pennington Rogers That's great

  
I think in reading it

  
you can feel how really lovingly
you put all of this together

  
and did this research and the attention
that you put to this

  
this really comes through
in the finished product

  
Well we have we have
a question from Jeff

  
Jeff says that "As a father
this talk changed my life

  
I bought the book a few copies
and was in the audience in December live

  
and it generated this concern for me

  
How much history was impacted
with lack of mother's input

  
especially Black mothers”

  
And that's the question

  
AMT Oh it's a big question

  
First thank you Jeff
I really appreciate that

  
So much of our history
we are missing these stories

  
And the feeling that you felt
in being in that audience

  
and that I felt
in uncovering these stories

  
and every piece of the puzzle that I found

  
just really shocked me

  
that we didn't know these things
already and infuriated me

  
And it really caused me some deep sadness

  
because I realized
how many more stories are 

  
I mean we're missing so many

  
and of course not everybody
is going to be famous

  
and not everyone’s going to have
a book written about them

  
But it's very very unique this erasure
of Black women's contributions

  
It is very intentional

  
Like I said with "Hidden
Figures" as an example

  
why would we not know that Black women
were the mathematicians

  
called "the computers"
behind a space launch

  
That is critical information
for our history

  
And for me to think
as a young Black woman

  
when I was sitting in school

  
when I was a young Black girl

  
what that could have meant
to me to know that

  
That it was a part not only of 

  
I could not be the first Black
woman to do something

  
but that there was a history before me

  
of Black female mathematicians

  
and these brilliant brains

  
And even as much as you know

  
my parents educated me on my Black
history and my African history

  
because even I have a privilege
that many Black Americans do not have

  
I knew my connection
to my lineage in Ghana etc

  
So much of this history
has been robbed from us

  
And it's a very strategic robbing

  
It's not a mistake

  
So that just thinking
from that perspective

  
we want to continue to uncover
more and more stories

  
of those who have been
intentionally marginalized

  
intentionally oppressed

  
Because the more we can correct
our telling of that story

  
and that history

  
the better we'll do moving forward

  
So these attacks on telling history
right now it's very strategic

  
It’s not again a mistake

  
It's not something
that people are doing unconsciously

  
It’s very “We don’t want
to tell the truth”

  
And we all need to reckon with that

  
and we need to fight against that

  
WPR I think that it's really
interesting in the book

  
that you draw these parallels
between what was happening

  
in the lives of these three women

  
and what we're seeing happening you know

  
play out in the news today

  
or have seen happen at other
moments in history during their lives

  
And you know I'm curious
to hear how you think

  
writing this book changed your perspective

  
on the experiences of mothers currently

  
just how you think about motherhood today

  
AMT Yeah this is something
that I already knew was an issue

  
Going back to my mom
she would always say

  
in every place that we travel
to pay attention

  
to how women are being treated
in the society

  
how mothers very specifically
are being treated

  
That is an indicator on how successful
this community will be

  
And so I always carry that
in the back of my mind

  
I was always aware that
when I moved back to the US for instance

  
that we weren’t really giving mothers
the support that they deserved;

  
we certainly weren’t giving them
the celebration that they deserve

  
and therefore the support was lacking

  
And there was this lack of understanding

  
around the critical
importance of the role

  
But in putting this book out there
and even doing the TED Talk

  
and speaking to so many different
audiences around this

  
it is a dire situation for mothers

  
And whether that's on a personal level

  
where those who have come up
to me and said

  
“I am the mom who feels
unappreciated in my household right now”

  
“I am the mom who feels unseen”

  
To this national level of a crisis

  
where we are fighting for weeks
of parental leave

  
mere weeks

  
This is 

  
It’s upsetting

  
and we should be embarrassed by that

  
These are things that should
have been established by now

  
and I really do 
and I say this in the TED Talk 

  
I truly hope that within my lifetime

  
we can usher in a shift that starts with
first saying “Mothers are essential”

  
We need mothers to be supported

  
because they are holding
so much of our lives together

  
our society together

  
Stayathome moms are performing some
of the most important work in our country

  
and we are devaluing them

  
And not only that we are making them
feel bad about what they are doing

  
This really is an issue
that more of us need to take on

  
Going back to that very first question

  
why this is an issue
for everybody to care about

  
And it sounds obvious

  
but we shouldn't have to say
that if mothers are dying

  
in a maternal health crisis 

  
one that is exacerbated for Black women 

  
the Black maternal health
crisis is alarming

  
but generally the maternal
health crisis in the US is terrible

  
It shouldn't be this way

  
Mothers of all races are dying
more than they should be

  
We need to pay attention to that

  
That's not only bad
for mothers obviously

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to walk away
from their job during the pandemic

  
because there were no supports
in place to catch them

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to choose
between being a mother

  
or making money for their family

  
That shouldn't be put on their shoulders

  
There should be supports in place

  
We should have affordable child care

  
We should have universal preschool

  
All of these things that impact mothers
have ripple effects for the rest of us

  
So yes it opened my eyes
to just how alarming

  
and how critical a situation
we're currently in

  
Even though again my mom raised me
to know all of these things

  
Through doing this work

  
I’ve just now been kind of
awoken to the need

  
for people to open their eyes right now

  
WPR M Watson has a question
that actually kind of piggybacks on this

  
more than just thinking about how
we can gain access to these stories

  
they want to know you know

  
what do you feel is the most
effective way we can as a people

  
change the narrative around Black women

  
You know if you have
any specific examples

  
which I know you share some in your talk

  
They ask

  
"How can I personally be involved
in this work of changing this narrative"

  
AMT Great question
and there are levels to this

  
I would say definitely
understanding the history

  
of how Black women
have been treated is very important

  
So again it's a shameless plug
but read the book

  
I talk about not only these three women

  
but again many of the goals that I had

  
one of them also was to explain tropes

  
like the mammy and the matriarch trope

  
and the Jezebel trope

  
and the "welfare queen"
and the strong Black woman trope

  
What all of these have meant
in American history

  
and what their intention was

  
And that is to say that anything
Black women were dealing with

  
was their own fault

  
That with the mammy trope
that we didn't deserve necessarily

  
to be compensated for work
that we were doing

  
that we deserved to stay
within domestic work

  
and that we shouldn't necessarily
be paid what that work was worth

  
because we liked it
and we were happy to be the mammy

  
The Aunt Jemima who was smiling
and wanted to do you know

  
wanted to serve her white family
more than her own

  
The matriarch trope that Black families
have been separated from each other

  
not because of systems
that have made it so that 

  
you know mass incarceration

  
or so many other things
that I can mention

  
but instead because Black women
were emasculating their men

  
Or the Jezebel trope that justified
sexual violence against Black women

  
because that's what Black women wanted

  
they were more promiscuous

  
Even the "welfare queen"

  
saying Black women are having children
just to make money

  
So you have to understand
this is a very long

  
ugly painful history

  
that we are dealing with as Black women
day in and day out

  
And when people don’t get

  
that those are the burdens we are holding

  
years and centuries of being told
that everything that's happening to you

  
the pain you're going through
is because of you

  
and not because of policies
we've voted for

  
or the ways in which we kept you
from being elected

  
or even being able to run for office

  
or even vote

  
That's where it really begins

  
Take the time as much as you can to know
how we've gotten to where it is right now

  
and then to really have a moment
where you fully appreciate

  
the incredible resistance of Black women

  
and the ways in which
we've continued to create life

  
despite the ways that people
have tried to rob it from us

  
And the vision behind what Black women
have been able to accomplish

  
what they have imagined for this world

  
because we can't accept
the situation as it is right now

  
because that dehumanize us

  
But we have pushed this nation forward
to our vision in incredible ways

  
It's not only Stacey Abrams in Georgia

  
it's a long long history
of Black women saying

  
"We don't agree
with the system as it is now

  
So here is how we're going to
help you see the world

  
and the possibilities
from our perspective"

  
And you look at American history
from that angle

  
and it is powerful

  
There is nothing like it

  
And therefore you better understand
why we should elect more Black women

  
why we should vote for them

  
to help usher our country
and continue to do it

  
But with even more support
and even more backing

  
because without that backing
without that support

  
when Black women have been erased
and misrecognized misrepresented

  
we have still created incredible change

  
So now we're asking that we be heard

  
we be listened to

  
and that our energy no longer be spent
on explaining how we got here

  
but instead on how we can do
whatever is next and whatever is possible

  
So it’s kind of a combination
of try to learn our history

  
support us as leaders

  
put those tools in our hands
as much as possible

  
Trust us hear us believe us

  
and also stop wasting our time
on the need to explain the extra

  
when that's work
that we can do on our own

  
That kind of brings me
full circle to my research

  
being around

  
I didn't reach out to the family
until I'd done my part

  
So yeah I mean even attending
a conversation like this

  
is part of doing your part
so kudos to you all

  
We're all real starting today

  
WPR And that's doing your part
to sort to educate yourself

  
on information that already
exists out there it sounds like

  
Beyond what we could do individually
to educate ourselves

  
and make change in this space

  
what can we expect from our government

  
to do more on the national scale

  
and even thinking globally

  
What are some things
that you would like to see

  
so that we change the way
that we as a culture

  
think about Black motherhood

  
AMT For this one

  
because I'll give it quicker answer
than I have in me

  
because you can tell I like to talk
and I can go for a long time

  
But in the book

  
the concluding chapter is entirely
about what we need to do as a world

  
and what are the lessons that Alberta

  
Berdis and Louise’s lives are teaching us
about our next steps forward

  
when it comes to policy
when it comes to 

  
actually even kind of
the threelevel layer

  
that I like to talk about

  
which is the interpersonal level
is an important one

  
The conversations
that we're having with each other

  
and the stories that we're telling

  
when I you know
in the TED Talk a little snippet

  
where we have mothers who feel
like they have to be selfless

  
and that we celebrate mothers
for being selfless

  
So even around Mother's Day
we say to moms

  
"Thank you for sacrificing
everything for me

  
and for putting yourself
behind everybody"

  
And yes a lot of mothers have done that

  
and certainly if they have
we should thank them for that

  
But what we can start to do is shift
that story and that thank you

  
and say "Thank you for doing
everything you could do for us

  
And also thank you for still seeing
yourself as a human being"

  
or "for representing yourself as a human
with a full range of emotions

  
and for teaching me
about my first life lessons

  
for being my first caretaker

  
for being my first leader
for being my first teacher"

  
Those are things that I think
more accurately represent mothering

  
in a way that is sustainable for mothers

  
Where mothers aren't going to burn out

  
where we're not putting all of it on moms

  
and then reiterating it by saying

  
"Thank you for putting yourself
behind everyone else"

  
So that's on like an interpersonal level

  
I do think those conversations
can make a huge difference

  
in terms of what mothers
are even thinking is the goal

  
of what we're trying to achieve

  
and what we want to be thanked for

  
The second level of that is
you know in relationships

  
even beyond our households 

  
And I mean like you said
in terms of Black motherhood

  
very specifically

  
this burden of putting
our needs behind everyone

  
I just did a piece
for “New York” magazine on this

  
that that is further
exacerbated for Black women

  
because we have been seen
as "the mothers" of a movement

  
We're always like mothers
of something much larger

  
and not just like mothers
of our own children

  
but this weight of what's placed upon us

  
And specifically in this article

  
I'm focusing on mothers
whose children have been killed

  
whether by police officers
or neighborhood vigilantes

  
and how in these moments

  
instead of giving these moms
the space to grieve

  
we're asking them to do something
for our entire country

  
You know we ask them to speak to crowds

  
they run for office which can be a part
of their personal healing as well

  
but we interpret that as look at what
this Black woman is doing for all of us

  
rather than us thinking about what is
she going to do for her own healing

  
for her own restoration

  
So that's kind of
the extra layer to that

  
And then thinking about it
on a national level

  
what we're voting for

  
I think about what could
have helped Alberta Berdis and Louise

  
and what we still need
to this day right now

  
So to give a little bit more
information on the women

  
Alberta King had to walk
away from her job

  
because the law stated at the time

  
that married women
were not allowed to teach

  
and she'd always had this dream
of being an educator

  
She had a bachelor's degree
she had a teaching certificate

  
but when she met her husband

  
she made the decision to start a family

  
because this was like
she had to make a decision

  
And even though that law
the marriage bar is not in place now

  
what are the many ways in which
we're pushing women and mothers

  
out of their jobs

  
There are many that still exist
and we need to start addressing those

  
These are just one example
from each woman

  
If we look at Berdis Baldwin

  
she was the victim of an abusive husband
for years years and years

  
And James Baldwin speaks about this often
how abusive his stepfather was

  
But she didn't have anyone
she could really turn to

  
because especially in Black communities

  
we are so afraid of what might happen
if we call a police officer

  
and we have multiple examples of this

  
where we really needed
help and intervention

  
and then somebody ends up
being shot when they're called

  
when police officers
are called to protect us

  
So Berdis Baldwin was aware of this

  
Her children had been harassed
by police officers

  
James Baldwin tells a story
of when he was pushed into an alley

  
and he was maybe  years old
and police officers searched him

  
they were looking for someone

  
and just left him there
on his own this little boy

  
So she's not going to call them
to help her in this situation

  
So she just endures this abuse
all on her own

  
So what are systems we can think about

  
in terms of should there be
other people we can call

  
who are not police officers

  
Should there be you know

  
more support even for social workers
that could come out

  
That's something to think about
and to reflect on

  
And then as an example for Louise Little

  
I mean all three of them have
these different painful traumas

  
that they experience

  
And for Louise one of the major ones

  
is that she is put in an institution
against her will for  years of her life

  
because she was this activist
radical activist

  
who spoke up against white supremacy

  
who stands and facesoff
with the KKK literally

  
And a white male physician was sent
to her house to evaluate her

  
after her husband had been murdered

  
And he concludes that she's
experiencing dementia

  
And in his doctor's note
he says that she is quote

  
"imagining being discriminated against"

  
"Imagining being discriminated against"

  
as a Black woman

  
Black immigrant woman
living in the Midwest

  
and that is enough to put her away
in an institution against her will

  
So in terms of us thinking
about the biases

  
that Black women are facing
when they don't ask for help even

  
and people just decide they're going
to come in and evaluate them

  
especially even when they do
that they're going to be misunderstood

  
that they're going to be told
they're imagining things

  
these are things we need to address

  
So we also have to do an evaluation
of our health care systems

  
and the biases that still exist

  
So it's kind of like this endless list

  
and I definitely don't want to end
on such a heavy and hard note

  
But in that concluding chapter

  
it's called "Our Lives
Will Not Be Erased"

  
that's where I go with it is policy

  
and what we can do

  
Kind of some tangible next steps

  
WPR Well I think that's
so important and so valuable

  
And to your point of not ending
in such a heavy place you know

  
I guess how do you feel though
about the progress we are making

  
M Watson asks do you feel

  
that the Black women
narrative is progressing

  
AMT I am an optimist

  
and I often say that my optimism
lies in this incredible activism

  
that Black women have held for so long

  
and we continue to envision
new realities for this world

  
And that makes me really hopeful

  
To study Alberta Berdis and Louise
who again it's not ancient history

  
Berdis passed away in 

  
Louise passed away in 

  
So this isn't like ancient
ancient history

  
but they did face a lot of things
that I no longer face

  
as a result of their work

  
and a result of what
they were able to accomplish

  
and how they taught their children
to accomplish these things

  
and change the world

  
So I'm not the kind of person
who thinks we are stuck

  
and there is no forward progress
that we've made

  
I feel like that would be really
disrespectful to them if I felt that way

  
because they gave as much
as they could to that progression

  
and it's my turn to carry
that forward as well

  
But what I do hope is that more
people join us in this

  
and that Black women are not continuing
to have to do this on our own

  
That more people will be aware of history

  
I sound like a broken record

  
but be aware of history
so that we can move forward

  
and fight anything that tries
to keep us from telling accurate

  
and full representations
of our country's history

  
Because I think if we're aware of it
then we won't want to repeat it

  
And we have more people who will want
to be allies in this fight

  
And in my contribution to this

  
I'm just hoping I'm giving more of us
tools to join the conversation

  
and think about how we can
carry it forward

So when I was  years old

  
I was a lonely geeky girl;

  
a firstgeneration Latina growing up
in a small Midwestern town

  
where hardly anyone else
had parents who spoke with thick accents

  
But then I came across
Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy

  
“The Lord of the Rings”

  
and I fell in love

  
(Applause)

  
What a cool world of elves

  
orcs

  
and small but heroic hobbits
fighting against impossible odds

  
to defeat a powerful enemy

  
Kind of like life

  
But one thing bothered me

  
There weren’t enough
female characters in this book

  
The adventurers accompanying
the protagonists were all male

  
It made me feel left out

  
like I did in school when 

  
you’re not going to believe this 

  
when my th grade teacher told me

  
“Why are you working so hard in math

  
You should be getting a boyfriend!”

  
(Audience boos)

  
But worse it offended
my sense of fairness

  
Surely girls could have adventures too

  
So what could I do

  
I sat down with my spiral notebook

  
and I rewrote the story

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I regendered a couple
of the main characters

  
and I added new scenes

  
like one where a female hobbit
devised a clever plan

  
to foil the Balrog

  
a monster who caused the death
of one of my favorite characters

  
By reimagining Tolkien’s fantasy world

  
I was creating a place

  
where someone like me could feel at home

  
Writing my story gave me comfort

  
But it also taught me a lot
about how to write

  
I never shared that spiral
notebook with anyone

  
But what I didn’t realize then

  
was I was writing something
called fanfiction 

  
(Laughter)

  
a story based on characters
or settings from another’s work 

  
and that I was not alone

  
It was an experience I never forgot

  
And many years later

  
after I became a data science professor
at the University of Washington

  
in 

  
I met another professor named Katie Davis

  
and we sat down over lunch

  
and discussed a recent news story

  
that claimed “kids today can’t write

  
all they produce
is misspelled short texts”

  
Katie and I didn’t believe it

  
We both knew kids whose writing abilities
defied these stereotypes

  
What’s more the talented young people
we happened to know

  
all had heavy involvement
in fanfiction reading and writing

  
So this apparent contradiction
sparked our exploration

  
into one of my most enduring
research projects

  
a deep data dive

  
into the vast world of fanfiction

  
to study the impact

  
that writing these stories
could have on the writers themselves

  
and whether writing fanfiction
could actually teach kids

  
to become stronger writers

  
And what we found surpassed
anything I could have imagined

  
So let me set the stage

  
For those of you who haven’t
heard the term before

  
fanfiction

  
sometimes known
as transformative literature

  
is said by some to go back centuries

  
After all in the s

  
John Milton wrote “Paradise Lost”
using characters from the Bible

  
(Laughter)

  
But today scholars generally feel

  
that modern fanfiction
traces its origins to typewritten zines

  
written by “Star Trek” fans
in the ‘s and’ s

  
And with the growth of the internet

  
barriers to sharing
have been lowered further

  
Millions of people are writing
and sharing fan fiction

  
on a variety of websites

  
around existing plots like “Harry Potter”

  
“Twilight”

  
“Naruto”

  
“My Little Pony” 

  
(Laughter)

  
and “Pokémon”

  
and many others

  
You probably have
a teenage relative or neighbor

  
who reads or writes fanfiction

  
These stories are wildly diverse

  
and may be creative
thoughtful or hilarious

  
You might find titles like

  
“When Harry Potter
Accidentally Started a Cult”

  
(Laughter)

  
Or “Five Times Hermione Snogged Harry 

  
(Laughter)

  
And One Time She Didn’t”

  
(Laughter)

  
The sheer quantity of fanfiction
that’s been produced is astonishing

  
In the past  years alone

  
over  billion words of fanfiction
have been written

  
and posted on a single online site

  
fanfictionnet

  
which is only one
of many fanfiction hubs

  
Now compare that with the amount
of fiction written in the English language

  
that’s been traditionally published

  
in all of human history 

  
 billion

  
So this is an incredible
outpouring of creativity

  
And on this site it's written
primarily by young people

  
This site’s  million members
write in  different languages

  
and their median age is  and a half

  
Most of the authors are between  and 

  
and most are teenage girls

  
 percent identify as female

  
and interestingly

  
more fanfiction authors identify
as gender nonconforming than male

  
Authors we interviewed
told us they wrote fan fiction

  
because they love
the characters and worlds

  
And over and over again

  
they told us how much
they learned about writing

  
from participating in these communities

  
Here’s an example

  
One author told us she started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
when she had this intense crush
on a fictional character

  
(Sighs)

  
It led her to write fanfiction
with phrases like

  
“gorgeous cerulean orbs” or

  
(Laughter)

  
“manly hunks of muscle”

  
(Laughter)

  
Kind of embarrassing

  
(Laughter)

  
And she told us

  
“But reviewers were kind enough

  
to be positive about
my amateurish fangirl postings

  
mostly because they also
like this character

  
But they also pointed out
my uses of clichés and overwriting

  
As a result I learned to be sensitive
to these types of bad writing

  
Today I publish original fiction

  
and no one has ever called me out
on a florid writing style”

  
She concluded with

  
“I think if a teacher had simply
redpencilied my childish scribbles

  
I might have been so discouraged
as to never write again”

  
Another author

  
who later became our student

  
told us that she learned about spelling
and grammar while writing fan fiction

  
But she also told us

  
“When I started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
I was a queer autistic middleschooler

  
who hadn’t yet realized
I was either of these things

  
I had difficulty with social situations

  
Fanfiction communities
were a vital social and learning outlet”

  
Today she’s done something
that few undergraduates ever have

  
She’s published a first author
academic paper in a toprated venue

  
(Applause)

  
After studying many individual
writers’ stories over time

  
we came to see that these personal stories
were consistent with the data

  
The young writers’ use of words
grew more diverse

  
as they received more reviews

  
So how did these kids learn

  
and from whom

  
To find out

  
we did a deeper dive into mentoring
in fanfiction communities

  
Now we expected to find traditional
mentormentee pairs

  
older or more experienced authors
mentoring younger

  
or less experienced ones

  
But what we found
was completely different

  
We found millions of authors
and readers communicating

  
via multiple channels

  
and reviewing each other’s work

  
regardless of experience level

  
People of all ages listening to
and reviewing each other’s stories

  
This was so cool we had to give it a name

  
so we call it “distributed mentoring”

  
You can also think of it
as nanomentoring

  
Each piece of mentoring
is tiny on its own

  
but the combination of all of it
is much greater than the sum of its parts

  
A key attribute of distributed
mentoring is its abundance

  
One author we interviewed

  
who wrote both traditionally
published fiction and fan fiction

  
told us that she received
more feedback in a single week

  
on her fanfiction

  
than she did in two years
on her published novel

  
It’s a difference not only of degree

  
but also of kind

  
By itself a single comment
on a story such as “loved it”

  
is relatively meaningless

  
but hundreds or thousands
provide valuable feedback

  
Like 

  
“I like the ambiguity of your ending 

  
it leaves me feeling hopeful”

  
and others like these

  
Reviewers build on
and reference each other’s comments

  
This enables authors to piece together

  
an overall view of their writing
that’s supportive as well as constructive

  
We found only one percent of comments
constituted bullying

  
And these are anonymous

  
This is a surprisingly low number

  
as anybody who has read comments
on an internet platform knows

  
What’s more

  
we found the supportive nature
of most of these comments was critical

  
in writing development

  
One author who was Black

  
made all the characters
from a popular TV show Black

  
She got comments filled
with readers’ sense of freedom

  
and delight from reading her story

  
It not only encouraged her
to keep writing

  
it gave her the conviction
that what she was doing was worthwhile

  
And so through this research

  
Katie and I found ourselves

  
not only believing
that yes kids can be good writers

  
but also that fanfiction

  
and distributed mentoring
could be used in formal education

  
A report from the National Assessment
of Educational Progress

  
found that a whopping
 percent of US students

  
in grades eight and 
lack proficiency in writing

  
Research has shown
that adolescence is a wonderful time

  
to improve your writing skills

  
and the popularity of fanfiction
in this age group shows

  
what an opportunity there is
to use it as a learning tool

  
So here's how I'm imagining it

  
Students with similar interests
from school districts across the country

  
could be connected with one another
to get and give anonymous feedback

  
on their writing

  
It must be anonymous

  
I know this from personal experience

  
Teachers could moderate the channels
to make sure feedback was constructive

  
as well as helping students learn from it

  
If this work grew burdensome for teachers

  
hierarchical moderation could help

  
which is a system where members
themselves can report negative

  
or abusive comments

  
and volunteer moderators
from among the students could decide

  
which ones to delete

  
with teachers weighing in
only when necessary

  
This technique is used
in many large online communities

  
and lots of adolescents
are familiar with it

  
Fanfiction is a private universe
that’s become a welcoming community

  
particularly for those
from marginalized groups

  
This vast and vibrant resource

  
for kids who have something to say

  
is especially meaningful to me

  
when I contrast it
with the isolation I encountered

  
growing up Latina in the US

  
And sometimes

  
I wonder what would have been
different in my own life

  
and maybe in many other people’s lives

  
if only we could have access
to this supportive community

  
of millions of young people

  
and their distributing mentoring

  
as kids

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
The last time I addressed
this august TED crowd was in 

  
from the main stage in Vancouver

  
where I was giving my first TED Talk
on the case for having children

  
And that's where I shared the news
I had just received earlier in the week

  
that my then twoyearold
daughter Nusayba

  
was diagnosed with stage IV cancer
and needed a full liver transplant

  
So how have your past three years been

  
As you can imagine

  
our last three years have been eventful

  
However they have given me some tough

  
learned lived experiences and lessons

  
about this ephemeral thing we call hope

  
And apparently there is a huge demand
for hope right now

  
In 

  
we're all dealing with multiple crises

  
A pandemic has killed  Americans

  
there's a partial lockdown
there's disinformation

  
there's income inequality

  
the rise of white supremacy
people telling people like me

  
“Go back to where you came from”

  
We have to learn new Greek letters
every few months

  
and oh yeah there's climate change

  
But other than that
things are pretty peachy

  
And with all of that you might be asking

  
“Well then why should we be hopeful
in such hopeless times Wajahat”

  
And that is a very valid question

  
And it's a perfectly fair question

  
But hope is what allowed me to believe
that my daughter would somehow survive

  
And she did

  
And so if I may allow me to share briefly

  
three pieces of advice or lessons

  
or things that we can do

  
that gave me hope in hopeless times

  
and that I hope can help you

  
Number one

  
Tie your camel first

  
There's a great saying in Islam

  
many Muslims know this

  
that have faith in God
but tie your camel first

  
As a dad

  
I felt utterly hopeless
with Nusayba's cancer

  
I'm the dad I'm supposed to fix things

  
But I couldn't fix cancer

  
Cancer plays for all the marbles

  
It's a relentless brutal
remorseless killing machine

  
It does not care
about your vacation plans

  
It does not care about your bucket list

  
It does not care about your Netflix queue

  
It comes for everything

  
Then coronavirus

  
Awesome

  
How do I defeat coronavirus

  
A yearold middleaged
slightly overweight male with flat foot

  
It's easy to feel helpless

  
out of control adrift

  
But at the end of the day

  
try letting go of what you can't control

  
and just focus on what you can control

  
The simple stuff

  
Wear a mask

  
Get vaccinated

  
Take care of your daily chores

  
Something that makes you feel
that you have some control

  
some agency in this world

  
When it came to Nusayba

  
that meant as a dad
just to be present you know

  
building her her Lego Friends set
when she asked me to build it

  
Watching "Frozen"  times

  
then followed by "Zootopia"  times

  
then followed by "Moana"  times

  
Getting her the tasty frozen yogurt
from the hospital vending machine

  
that she loved

  
Do what you can the best you can

  
Have hope but tie your camel first

  
And then be like Elsa from "Frozen"

  
and let the rest go

  
Number two

  
invest in joy

  
Make the intention to actively invest
in this thing called joy every day

  
Almost like a workout

  
You have to commit to it

  
It has to be a discipline

  
Build and flex that muscle

  
The world does not need
more masochists or martyrs

  
It does not need more overworked
overstressed burnouts

  
New rule for 

  
You deserve to have moments of joy
even if they are fleeting

  
every day that you are alive

  
And you have to take those moments

  
you have to grab them
you have to seize them

  
I love food

  
so I learned how to cook Pakistani food

  
took my mom's recipes during lockdown

  
My kids love Lego
so that means now I love Lego

  
I love drinking chai

  
I make a cup of chai every day
it makes me happy

  
No matter how much stress or pain
or misery I was going through

  
I made sure to invest time every day

  
to invest in things and people

  
and experiences that gave me joy

  
And finally number three

  
I would recommend humbly
invest in the narrative of hope

  
because the alternative
is apathy and cynicism

  
Investing in hope is painful

  
It means opening yourself up
to the possibility of pain

  
betrayal and disappointment

  
It's easier to court cynicism right

  
You expect nothing so you lose nothing

  
But it also means you have resigned
yourself to the cheap seats

  
You are a spectator who yells out "Boo"

  
instead of being a participant in the ring
where your nose could get bloody

  
but at least you're pushing
the ball forward

  
It means choosing apathy and nihilism
which is comforting and easy

  
but also lazy and destructive

  
During Nusayba's cancer

  
I used to sit up every night
after my family went to sleep

  
and I stayed up till like
three or four am I couldn't sleep

  
And instead I imagined

  
like Doctor Strange
in "Avengers Endgame"

  
with the time stone

  
every possible scenario and outcome
just to prepare myself as a father

  
I had to emotionally prepare
for every outcome

  
So I used to imagine Nusayba dying

  
I imagined burying her with my own hands

  
I imagined making the phone call
to her grandparents

  
explaining that she had died
listening to them cry

  
I imagined living the rest of my life
like a shell of a man

  
but pretending to put a smile on my face

  
because I had a son to raise
and now a daughter

  
My wife badass that she is

  
was also pregnant
during Nusayba's cancer

  
I had to be prepared

  
But I also chose to invest in a narrative
in which Nusayba lived

  
And I imagined seeing her alive

  
with a liver transplant smiling

  
regaining her hair full of joy and life

  
I preferred that story

  
That's the story I invested in

  
even as we were sitting on the edge
of what seemed like a falling cliff

  
I decided I would put out the lawn chair
and at least enjoy the scenery

  
Over  people mostly strangers

  
chose to sign up
to be donors for Nusayba

  
even people who told me
they hated me for my politics

  
They were moved by her story

  
Sometimes some people can change

  
Sometimes some people
can choose to do and be good

  
An anonymous donor Shawn Zahir

  
decided to give a piece of his liver
to a girl he never met

  
just so she could live

  
I'm not Pollyanna

  
I'm not a foolish
wideeyed naive optimist

  
I'm a pragmatist

  
fully aware of the many challenges
and horrors we are facing

  
But through my own personal experience
if it is at all helpful

  
I can assure you that walking
through this forest of horrors

  
going on this journey
wherever it may lead

  
if you choose to invest in hope

  
it at least makes the ride
a bit sweeter and easier

  
And as the wise ram tells Po
in “Kung Fu Panda ”

  
"Your story may not have
such a happy beginning

  
but that does not make you who you are

  
It is the rest of it

  
who you choose to be"

  
Right now

  
survival is victory in this story
that we are living

  
We are alive during a pandemic

  
We are winning

  
And just for that we should be grateful

  
And I hope the choices we make
in these challenging times will

  
Inshallah God willing

  
lead to a better story for all of us

  
And I believe that begins
with choosing to invest in hope

  
during hopeless times

  
Whitney Pennigton Rogers
Thanks so much for that

  
It was really wonderful to hear

  
and I think we may even hear
Nusayba in the background

  
which is I think exciting

  
WA I'm sorry that's her
it's virtual school

  
I'm doing the best I can

  
The wildlings are right there

  
What's keeping us from the wildlings
is a very thin wall so let's pray

  
WPR I think we talked
about this before we started

  
that we're all at home right now

  
That's the thing I think we all know

  
So that's what it is

  
I think before we dive into just
talking more about what you've suggested

  
around growing hope

  
I'd love to start by talking
a little bit about your book

  
"Go Back to Where You Came From"

  
because I think that it
will provide a nice foundation

  
for sort of understanding
your thinking around this

  
and sort of how you've come
to really embrace this

  
So I guess maybe you could start first
by talking about the title of the book

  
You know it's part memoir
part historical analysis

  
part howto guide on being inclusive
and creating a place of belonging

  
How did you come up with the title

  
Why did you choose this
for the title of your book

  
WA So the title is “Go Back
to Where You Came From

  
And Other Helpful Recommendations
on How to Become American”

  
Very deliberate tongue in cheek
both ugly and funny right

  
Because I believe that's the lived
experience of life

  
But that's the lived experience
of many Americans

  
who are still trying to love a country
that doesn't love us back

  
And so how do you respond to that pain

  
And some people cry
as you can tell I laugh

  
And so this book is also an elegy

  
for the rest of us

  
who are still striving
to be coprotagonists

  
of this American narrative

  
And the book tries to expand
and stretch this country

  
to accommodate all of us

  
to become the multiracial
democracy it has to become

  
Or else I believe it'll all fail

  
And it's done with a lot
of humor and hope

  
and throughout the journey
you read the book

  
you know I talk about Nusayba's cancer

  
but there's lots of interesting
things that happen to me

  
WPR To put it mildly

  
WA Yeah my life is like a telenovela

  
like a Mexican soap opera
for better and for worse

  
And so I hope that when you get
to the end part

  
where I talk about "invest in hope
but tie your camel first"

  
the hope that I give
the audience for the future

  
I don't want it to make it a hallmarky

  
fake saccharine Hollywood ending

  
I want you to really like
I want it to be earned

  
And you know the way to earn it
is to confront the horrors

  
confront the challenges name it own it

  
Talk about the pain
wear the mileage and the scars

  
But despite all of that
you still persist right

  
And because I agree I mean

  
what I said in the speech
the fiveminute talk that I just gave you

  
I believe in it

  
I've been on all the sides
in moments of deep despair

  
I've been there of darkness of pain

  
and I realize if you tap out it's over

  
If you tap out it's done

  
And what I've seen

  
and we'll probably talk about it
because you read the book

  
in those moments in my life
where you feel like it's over it's done

  
I'm at the edge of the cliff
and I'm about to fall

  
there's been a plot twist

  
Like the the page turns

  
and with it comes like a better story

  
And so in the book
I mention there was a time

  
where I was completely broke homeless

  
my parents were in jail
I was taking care of my grandparents

  
And I’m like there’s no way
I couldn’t even imagine my future

  
I couldn't imagine
living to the age of 

  
I thought I would be dead by 

  
I’m being honest
with anyone who’s listening

  
My timeline you know I imagine a lot
like I said like Doctor Strange

  
it ended at 
I just couldn't imagine it

  
And I just knew that I would die

  
It’d be over and I almost did die

  
But here I am sitting in my home

  
married to a woman
who's way better than me

  
I married way up

  
Like hotter than me smarter than me

  
like it’s ridiculous not even cool

  
And then I got three kids
and then Nusayba who was supposed to die

  
that’s what they told me
she wouldn’t make it

  
They said every complication
against this girl is happening

  
you could just hear her
chirping right now

  
I'm sure you guys can hear her
chirping that's Nusayba

  
So you never know you never know

  
WPR We have a question
that came in from Darcy

  
where Darcy asked "The idea
of investing in hope is a great one

  
But how can we make it tangible

  
You mentioned visualization
or avoiding complaining

  
but how else can we actually
bring this to life"

  
WA It's a very good question

  
and that's where I say
tie your camel first

  
You have to exhaust yourself
of every possibility within your control

  
You know and after that
you have to let go

  
I'll give you an example
I mention it in the book

  
There was a moment
my parents were in jail

  
I'm  years old I have to leave school

  
I'm taking care of my grandparents

  
my grandmothers who used to live with me

  
I'm an only child

  
I have to care of the family business

  
I have to pay the lawyer

  
It's post/ my community
turns vicious and cruel

  
Bad news travels fast
ladies and gentlemen

  
bad news travels fast

  
I'm surgical with my budget

  
I have an Excel sheet

  
I've got to pay all the bills

  
According to my Excel sheet

  
after I withdrew the  dollars
from Wells Fargo

  
on the corner of Warm Springs and Mission

  
I was supposed to have  dollars left

  
I go to the ATM of Wells Fargo

  
I take out the  bucks
I get the receipt

  
I look at the bottom
instead of  dollars

  
it was 

  
I had  dollars 

  
I had to pay the bills pay the lawyer

  
take care of my family

  
And I swear to you at that time 

  
I mean honestly I said
“I have done everything in my power

  
I am exhausted

  
What can I do with three cents”

  
I didn't even get angry
I didn't get upset

  
I remember this vividly
it was a beautiful Bay Area day

  
anyone who lives there knows
pm little bit of a windy breeze

  
The sun was still there
it was just idyllic

  
And I remember I started laughing
look at the receipt

  
and a couple of people behind me

  
were trying to figure out
what’s wrong with this guy

  
Because I didn’t know what to do
I just chuckled I had three cents left

  
So this is what I did

  
I took the  dollars went across
the street and decided to splurge

  
I went to Subway

  
and had a Subway supersized meal

  
footlong tuna sandwich
with all the workings and avocado

  
And then I decided to have
two chocolate chip cookies

  
Then I went next door and had 
what is a Venti

  
What's the largest one at Starbucks

  
WPR I think Venti I don't drink coffee

  
WA Venti caramel frappe
with extra caramel drizzle right

  
And I had now  dollars
became  dollars

  
I went home and I told my grandmother

  
I said "I've done
everything I possibly could

  
There's nothing else I can do

  
We have  bucks left I'm sorry"

  
I had some Dal Chawal that night
watched a Netflix movie

  
And I remember I said this
in the book I let go

  
There's nothing else I could do

  
I completely let go

  
I said Allah whatever happens
Inshallah I leave it up to you

  
I've done everything within my powers

  
like everything I could possibly
think of I've done

  
This is it like
you want to save me save me

  
you don't want to save me whatever
I enjoyed my Subway meal

  
And I remember
this is really interesting

  
I had the best night's sleep that night
that I have ever had in my life

  
I remember that sleep to this day

  
I have prayed for that sleep

  
I felt like I was a baby
in my mother's womb

  
I tried to wonder why

  
It's because I knew that I did
everything within my powers

  
I exhausted myself and I let it go

  
And then what happened

  
somehow I got a loan
and  bucks came

  
And the story continued

  
And so when you're saying
about doing something tangible

  
it's not just me saying that like

  
you have to have some feeling
of control and autonomy

  
in what is a world where you feel adrift

  
and the ground is shifting
beneath your feet

  
Those small chores
that you take for granted

  
they'll give you order some discipline

  
I’m making that chai I’m painting this

  
I’m feeding my children
I took out the trash

  
I did some work today

  
I can control this
I did this with my hands

  
I'm still alive right

  
And then you plot
and you do the best you can

  
and then you let go

  
And I think those daily chores
that daily routine that you establish

  
gives you a sense of rhythm

  
at the very least says

  
"The world can take everything
but it won't take this

  
It won't take my delicious cup of chai
that I made with my own hands

  
It won't take this little plant
I plotted outside

  
It won't take my love for my kids

  
It won't take that from me

  
Not today death not today"

  
So I hope for whoever asked that question
I hope that was hopeful

The moon goddess Ix Chel patiently
watched a spider at work

  
She could make use of it skills 
she thought

  
Through careful observation and imitation
she soon became a skilled weaver

  
The sun god Kinich Ahau 
was impressed with her work

  
and admired her from afar

  
But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive

  
and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter

  
To get past the grandfather
the sun god disguised himself

  
as a hummingbird

  
As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey

  
the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather

  
to capture the bird for her

  
The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart stunning him

  
Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health

  
and soon he was able to spread his wings
and fly again

  
He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess

  
to escape with him

  
The two rowed away in a canoe

  
but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god

  
to help him stop them

  
Sensing danger the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below

  
and transformed into a crab

  
But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt

  
which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart killing her

  
Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered

  
buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings

  
They formed a thick magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body

  
For thirteen days the dragonflies cut 
cleaned and hollowed thirteen logs

  
On the thirteenth night 
the logs burst open

  
and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever

  
The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage

  
The moon goddess happily agreed

  
Sidebyside they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays

  
Unfortunately the story 
doesn’t end there

  
The sun god’s brother visited often

  
Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel 
the sun god grew jealous

  
and began to mistreat her

  
One day Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank

  
furious at her husband

  
A huge bird came gliding down

  
and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks

  
To get away from the cruel sun god
she agreed

  
There she met the king of the vultures

  
The vulture king was kind and funloving—

  
a much better partner
than the violent sun god

  
The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains

  
When the sun god heard he was distraught

  
He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down

  
then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom

  
where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king

  
He begged her to come home with him
apologizing for how he had treated her

  
The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back

  
But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again

  
He struck her scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays

  
Ix Chel flew off into the dark

  
From then on she vowed 
to appear only at night

  
She befriended the stars and combined
her pale blue rays with their light

  
to guide night travelers to safety

  
She used her healing gift

  
which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god

  
to cure people who were ill

  
Today Ix Chel is so widely known

  
that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture

  
But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya

  
Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities

  
In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists

  
the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends

  
beyond the limits 
of the historical record

  
Her story like all myths 
isn’t just one story

  
the variations ancient and modern
speak to what people value

  
and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes

  
So I come from Bosnia

  
I mean I live in Sweden now

  
but you don't need to know
my whole life story

  
But the story that I do want to share
is from my home country

  
So close to  percent
of the land in Bosnia

  
is dedicated to agriculture and farming

  
So the government
decides to support farmers

  
to set up a budget

  
to set up the requirements
for the people to receive the budget

  
and then to disburse the funds

  
So they do that and towards
the end of the process

  
they decide to analyze
who really received these funds

  
And they did that

  
and the Ministry
of Agriculture was shocked

  
because only one group of citizens
received  percent of these funds

  
And those were men
men working in agriculture

  
So where were the women

  
Why didn't they have access to the funds

  
The Minister of Agriculture was surprised
because they didn't mean to discriminate

  
They knew there were women
working in agriculture right

  
So they went back
and analyzed the situation

  
And the problem was 
well there were three things

  
The first thing is they didn't even know
the gender of farmers

  
because they'd never done
gender analysis before

  
So actually they did know
the sex disaggregation of cows

  
but not of people

  
(Laughter)

  
I will let that sink a bit 

  
because gender is unimportant

  
The second issue is that the way
they were distributing the funds

  
could not possibly reach women

  
Why Because one of the conditions
to get this subsidy

  
was to give out
a land ownership certificate

  
and we know that traditionally
women do not own land

  
And the second problem
was that women didn't even know

  
Why Because the information was shared
at forums that they do not participate in

  
But the story has a happy end
because when the ministry realized this

  
they changed these provisions

  
And with the help
of gender experts from Bosnia

  
we now see more and more women
getting funds every year

  
So what is the point of this story

  
The point is not only that we should have
sexdisaggregated data on people

  
not only cows

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's also that we can budget
fair and equitably

  
but we can't just run numbers blindly

  
We need to know the faces of the people
that we are serving with public funds

  
So this is really the heart
of genderresponsive budgeting

  
or as I like to think of it
and maybe you too

  
commonsense budgeting

  
(Laughter)

  
So I'm an economist

  
I work with public finance
so public finance and budgets

  
but my specialty is helping governments
inject a gender perspective

  
in their financial decisions and budgets

  
OK so budgets are fairly simple
straightforward

  
as it was introduced

  
and now you are thinking

  
"Well that does not look
fairly straightforward"

  
And it's intentionally done like that

  
because this is how we often imagine
the budget to be so complex

  
so technocratic bureaucratic
we don't even want to engage

  
But the reality
is very different than that

  
In fact all our budgets

  
be it your own budgets
or public budgets or company budgets

  
go through the four logical steps

  
The first step is of course
we are calculating our revenues

  
In the sense of the state
it would be taxes and fees right

  
The second step is budget approval

  
After we figure out
what we will do with the funds

  
it goes to the approval of the parliament

  
And then the third step
my personal favorite

  
is spending or budget execution

  
Ideally according to priorities 
not my personal favorite

  
And then we go into control
and budget oversight

  
So whether we have actually spent
the money as we planned

  
and also whether we have
achieved the objectives

  
So in the sense of the state

  
it would be an increased
level of education

  
decreased level of poverty

  
In the sense of the companies
it would be profit or income

  
You see where I'm going

  
So what is really wrong with that

  
It sounds perfectly logical

  
Well what is wrong with that

  
is that traditionally in most countries
if not all around the world

  
we assume when we are planning
the budget funds

  
that we are targeting one universal
homogenous human

  
that will have the same access to funds
the same needs almost

  
And then a situation such as this one
in the Ministry of Agriculture happens;

  
then we are surprised that our funds
didn't really reach everybody

  
So what I want to also say here
what do we then do about that

  
In Ukraine the government has analyzed
close to  budget programs

  
And when I say “budget programs”

  
these are expenditures
in health education sports

  
infrastructure defense 

  
anything you can think of
that is funded with public funds

  
And in every single one of these programs
we have found gender gaps

  
We have found big gender gaps

  
And these gender gaps
were usually on account of women 

  
they didn't have access

  
And why did this happen

  
It happened because finance officers
were just doing their jobs

  
and they were doing it really well

  
They were planning for economic
effectiveness efficiency

  
value for money 

  
We really love value for money

  
Performance budgeting mediumterm 

  
all of these very valid
economic objectives

  
very valid goals

  
but we really didn't account
for the needs of the people

  
that we are serving with these funds

  
And let me illustrate that

  
So we have analyzed
the program for tuberculosis

  
So treatment of patients
with tuberculosis

  
And you may be now asking

  
"OK but you know
you need to treat the patient

  
Why is gender important here"

  
But when we have done the analysis

  
we have actually seen that  percent

  
of the patients
with tuberculosis were men

  
And tuberculosis
is a big issue in Ukraine

  
And these were men living in remote areas
in rural areas working in mines

  
However the preventive measures
and the way they were designed

  
they didn't account for it

  
They were actually targeting
those sectors

  
such as education and health

  
where women traditionally dominate

  
And this is fine

  
but they really didn’t account
for the needs of the men in these groups

  
And why

  
Because gender equality was not important
in the budget decision

  
So what I'm trying to illustrate here

  
is not only that we need
to account for gender equality

  
to achieve our objectives of equality

  
but we also need to account for it to make
more commonsense budgetary decisions

  
more effective and efficient budgets

  
So how do we do that

  
It looks equally entertaining

  
but now we also add gender

  
so it's a total mess and we would think
"How do we even go about that"

  
But of course
it's not as complex as that

  
because in the heart of this work
is gender analysis

  
And what do I mean by that

  
So when we are planning
as finance officers

  
any financial or fiscal decision

  
meaning when we are planning
introducing a new tax for example

  
the core is to analyze
how will that influence

  
different groups in a society

  
So will we have
our gender gaps increased 

  
we don’t want to do that 

  
reduced or leave the status quo

  
So of course we want to reduce them

  
and I just want to put it here as well

  
in most countries 
not all unfortunately

  
but in a lot of countries
around the world

  
we have a very solid legislative framework
for gender equality

  
We have commitments

  
But when it comes to budget and finance

  
that's where suddenly
the story evaporates

  
So when it comes to money

  
it's not really analyzed
for gender impact

  
So this is really important

  
and we do this in as I said three steps

  
I will take you very fast
through these steps don't worry

  
So the first step is really
to do a situation analysis

  
So in our agriculture example

  
if we had done a situation analysis

  
and if we had known
the gender gaps in this sector

  
we wouldn't have been surprised

  
We would have known
that women do not own land

  
so we wouldn't give this as a requirement

  
and we would definitely have known
that we need to inform them

  
in a different way

  
So this is the first step

  
The second step is related to my example
with sex disaggregation

  
you will remember from the beginning

  
So we really need to know
the beneficiaries

  
that we are trying to serve

  
And now you are thinking
"This sounds very obvious"

  
but it's not done

  
And the third step of course
is to know the procedures

  
How will we give this budget out
who will have access

  
What will be the excluded groups

  
And that's it

  
And now I will just share
some good news I think

  
It's that around  countries
around the world

  
are working with gender budgeting

  
And please if you have an interest

  
just see if your own country
is one of them

  
But when I say they are working
with gender budgeting

  
that does not mean that their whole budget
is genderresponsive

  
That would be my dream

  
But my personal hero is Austria Why

  
Because they have gender budgeting
entrenched in the constitution

  
So that means that in Austria

  
it cannot happen that you have
an investment project

  
that you are doing
without considering gender

  
and gender equality

  
Canada  feminist government
genderbalanced cabinet 

  
and they are doing gender budgeting

  
but they are taking into account
the needs of Indigenous groups of people

  
So this is also something
that we want to do

  
and we have to do

  
Let me take you to Morocco

  
Morocco is working with gender
budgeting for  years

  
Indonesia with the help
of the World Bank

  
has just analyzed
their whole budget system

  
to make it more genderresponsive

  
And I need to take you again to Bosnia

  
because I did start with that example

  
Balkan countries are doing fantastic work
with the help of UN Women

  
So there is a lot of work happening

  
and I am now coming to an end

  
because you might now be wondering

  
"OK but what is in it
for me" in a sense

  
"You are talking about public budgets

  
but I work in a company or NGO
or I'm selfemployed" doesn't matter

  
So what is it Why is it important for us

  
Because this is our money

  
These are our budgets

  
We are filling these budgets 

  
it's not some abstract money out there

  
so we have the right to demand it
to be equitable to be fair

  
That's one thing

  
So it is important for countries
it's important for companies

  
Of course we should ask
who is making decisions

  
whose needs are being satisfied

  
And also maybe families

  
But who really has the voice
who is making decisions

  
It's interesting just to see
and then to maybe be surprised

  
that these ministries are not

  
So if you are interested
you are literally one click away 

  
and I'm aware this sounds
like a sales pitch

  
but I am selling you the work of many
many genderbudgeting experts

  
around the world

  
who have been for years
working with these concepts

  
So you have such a wealth of material

  
from UN Women IMF different scholars

  
World Bank Swedish government 

  
doesn’t matter I will not go
into all the wealth of materials

  
So it's all out there

  
And if we do that
we will have the budgets

  
that will not only lead
to gender equality

  
which is an amazing objective in itself

  
but we will have better more effective
more efficient more fair budgets

  
What's not to like

  
So I hope next time we meet
maybe here again

  
this type of genderresponsive budgeting
will be called "budgeting"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
So when I was born on September  

  
my grandparents and great
grandparents back in India

  
didn't find out for two weeks

  
which is a shame because I mean
look how perfect I was

  
(Laughter)

  
And it's not because the phone
lines were down

  
or because they weren't available

  
It's because there was
a complication with my birth

  
And that complication
was being assigned female at birth

  
You see because my mom had been told
that if she gave birth to a daughter

  
it wasn't worth phoning home about

  
After all she’d already given birth
to my older sister

  
and this time everyone had high hopes
that she would do right and have a son

  
But she didn't

  
She had me

  
And so there were no congratulations
or Indian sweets sent our way

  
Just the reality that from the moment
I came into this world

  
I was already a disappointment
to so many people

  
It's as if they had a time machine

  
and already knew the trajectory
of my entire career and life

  
and decided that I had less to offer

  
And it sucked

  
So why am I telling you this heavy story

  
I'm supposed to be a funny person

  
I have the nerve to come out here
and hit you right in the feels

  
How dare I

  
I'm telling you this because although
this is my lived experience

  
it's also the reality
that millions of girls face every day

  
across every culture and in every country

  
And I'm telling you this
because being born into this reality

  
set me on a lifetime mission
of trying to prove myself

  
and just feel like I was enough

  
What did I want to be when I grow up

  
I wanted to be treated equally

  
And I'm not alone in this mission

  
In fact us girls
what we desperately want

  
is a seat at the table

  
It's what every motivational poster
Tumblr post Instagram account you follow

  
business card tells us

  
Success is a seat at the table

  
And if they want to be extra spicy

  
they say "If there is no seat
drag your own seat"

  
I'm sure you've heard this right

  
And so my marching orders were clear

  
Get a seat at this coveted table
by any means necessary

  
And that's been the driving force
behind my entire career

  
Now in 

  
I noticed that no one
on YouTube looked like me

  
There was no South Asian woman
who's very loud and uses her hands a lot

  
giving her take on the world

  
There was no me in front of a camera

  
I saw a seat up for grabs

  
So I got to work and I started a channel
under the name “Superwoman”

  
Yeah because although
I’m smart enough to do a TED Talk

  
I'm not smart enough
to understand copyright

  
(Laughter)

  
I taught myself how to write

  
shoot and edit my own content

  
And I worked really hard

  
When I finally got the hang of it

  
I committed to posting
two comedy videos a week

  
And I found success

  
With a backwards snapback on my head

  
I gave my take on relationships
pop culture taboo subjects

  
and most popularly
dressed up like my parents

  
(Laughter)

  
I can't tell you how many times
I forgot to wipe that chest hair off

  
A lot of times

  
(Laughter)

  
Now fast forward to 

  
and I'm on stage in India
announcing my first world tour

  
As fate would have it

  
the day after this monumental milestone

  
I was set to fly to Punjab India

  
to visit my grandfather
for the first time in my adult life

  
And whoo nothing could have prepared me

  
for what was about to happen

  
I vividly remember it

  
I was in the car driving to his house

  
He was standing outside

  
I nervously got out of the car
walked up to him

  
He walked up to me
looked me right in the eyes

  
and he raised his hand

  
and decorated me with a flower garland

  
a gesture fit for people of importance

  
He then proceeded to welcome me
into his home my mom by my side

  
and proceed to show me
all the newspaper clippings he had saved

  
with my name and face on them

  
He said the words he was wrong

  
Words I had never heard
a man say before to me

  
He said that I had done
what no one else could have done

  
and I had made the family name proud

  
Me Lilly the baby born a girl

  
That's right

  
Now in that moment
I truly felt like Superwoman

  
I did

  
You know through my YouTube videos

  
I've amassed almost  million subscribers
and three billion views

  
But more important than all of that

  
I managed to change one view

  
I challenged my grandfather's
entrenched gender beliefs

  
And for the first time in my life
I remember thinking in that moment

  
“Oh I finally got
a seat at the table ”

  
Hello props

  
(Laughter)

  
"  alongside the men in the industry”

  
I felt like that

  
And encouraged
by my grandfather's approval

  
I became more confident in my influence

  
I remember thinking "Oh I'm going
to talk at this table

  
I'm going to join
the dinner conversation"

  
You know a lot of my male mentors
make comments and posts

  
about box office numbers
and salaries and titles

  
and those dollar dollar bills

  
So I thought

  
I'm going to chime in here

  
I learned very quickly
that whenever I spoke of money

  
people got a little uncomfortable

  
Like the time I pointed out the gender gap

  
in the Forbes list for online creators

  
a list I'd previously been on

  
I remember wanting to start
a critical conversation

  
because I saw this article
and I was heartbroken

  
You know the digital space
had always been a place

  
that I thought was without gatekeepers

  
And here it was looking
just like old Hollywood

  
Well let me tell you
the internet was not interested

  
I don't know how it's possible

  
but it literally felt as if Twitter
leaped through my screen

  
and body slammed me onto my desk

  
The message was clear

  
you can be on this list

  
but don't try to start any conversations
about the inequality on this list

  
I have thousands and thousands of videos

  
One of my most disliked videos
is why I’m not in a relationship

  
Yeah

  
A lot of the men at the table
did not like me telling them

  
why I didn't need a boyfriend

  
I quickly learned

  
that there’s an invisible
gatekeeper called culture

  
and the table is smack dab
in the middle of it

  
Now in 

  
I made history with my latenight show

  
“A Little Late with Lilly Singh”

  
Thank you thank you

  
(Applause)

  
There I was Lilly
the baby born a brown girl

  
rubbing elbows or at least time slots

  
with comedy royalty

  
And I got to give a huge shout out to NBC

  
for boldly trying to break
latenight tradition

  
I remember when the show came out

  
I remember all the articles
because they looked practically identical

  
"Bisexual Woman of Color
Gets LateNight Show"

  
I almost legally changed my name
to "bisexual woman of color"

  
because that's what people
called me so often

  
And you know as strange
as that sentiment was I thought OK

  
the silver lining is that we'll finally
get a different perspective in latenight

  
A little bit of melanin a dash of queer

  
a different take on things

  
Let's do this!

  
And I remember thinking

  
"Now oh now I've been invited
to the big table

  
And now things will be different"

  
So I took my seat

  
Now unfortunately

  
the budget wasn't based
on the importance or significance

  
or historic nature of the show

  
It was based on the am
timeslot that we had

  
So to say the budget was small

  
the writing staff even smaller

  
and to do the first season

  
I had to shoot  episodes
of latenight television in three months

  
Audience Whoo

  
LS Whoo is right

  
To put that into perspective

  
that is shooting two
to three episodes a day

  
versus the network standard of one a day

  
maybe two on Thursday

  
We did it all with a writing staff
of about half a dozen writers

  
versus the network standard
that's about double that

  
Words cannot explain
to you how exhausting

  
emotionally and spiritually
challenging that was

  
And I started to feel like

  
"Hm I think this chair's
a little wobbly"

  
Now I think we can all agree

  
that the beauty and magic
of latenight is its timeliness

  
You know that no matter
what's happening in the world

  
you can turn on latenight television
and hear all about it

  
But when you shoot  episodes
in three months

  
you kind of lose that magic

  
I was the only show talking about
hooking up partying cuddling traveling

  
in front of a live audience
during a literal global pandemic

  
Now still I thought

  
if the budget doesn't celebrate
the historicness of the show

  
then the creative can

  
I can bring some much needed
spice to latenight

  
And sometimes I was successful

  
But other times

  
I would receive notes like

  
"Don't be so loud"

  
"Don't be so big"

  
"Don't be so angry smile more"

  
And my all time favorite

  
"Don't overindex
on the South Asian stuff"

  
After all everyone else at the table
who's been sitting there for years

  
people are used to them

  
I might be a little jarring to audiences

  
Now during season two of my show

  
I remember I went into overdrive

  
I found all the loopholes
I did all the necessary jobs

  
to try to make the show more timely

  
And I was excited to

  
And I felt compelled to
because for the first time in history

  
we had a woman not to mention
half South Asian woman

  
become vice president
of the United States

  
Now we witnessed one of the greatest
protests in human history

  
with the farmer protests in India

  
And I was excited to finally give
my take on these things

  
But my take was almost never included

  
in topical media news coverage roundups

  
You know we still got the same voices

  
the same perspectives

  
even though someone
and something different

  
was literally in the next time slot

  
I kept trying to pull up my seat

  
I kept trying to join
the dinner conversation

  
I kept trying to ask
for a more supportive seat

  
But every time I would be told

  
that I should be grateful
to have a seat in the first place

  
After all everyone else
that looks like me

  
is still waiting outside
the restaurant in the cold

  
You know the strange thing
about having a wobbly seat

  
is that you spend so much time
trying to keep it upright

  
that you can never bring
your full self to the table

  
So now why am I telling you all this

  
Well because my therapist
costs  dollars an hour

  
and this is way cheaper

  
(Laughter)

  
But also because I just experienced

  
one of the most notorious boys' clubs ever
in latenight television

  
And I'm here to offer solutions

  
I don't always follow up
a venting session with solutions

  
but when I do it’s a TED Talk

  
(Laughter)

  
That's right

  
(Applause)

  
You see my goal was always
a seat at the table

  
It's what women are conditioned
to believe success is

  
And when the chair doesn't fit

  
when it doesn't reach the table
when it's wobbly

  
when it's full of splinters

  
we don't have the luxury
of fixing it or finding another one

  
But we try anyways

  
We take on that responsibility
and we shoulder that burden

  
Now I've been fortunate enough
to sit at a few seats

  
at a few different tables

  
And what I've learned is
when you get the seat

  
trying to fix the seat
won't fix the problem

  
Why

  
Because the table was never built
for us in the first place

  
The solution

  
Build better tables

  
(Applause)

  
So allow me to be
your very own IKEA manual

  
I would like to present to you
a set of guidelines

  
I very eloquently call

  
“How to Build a Table that Doesn’t Suck”

  
(Laughter)

  
I've been told I'm very literal

  
Now right off the bat let me tell you

  
this assembly is going to take
more than one person

  
or group of people

  
It's going to take everyone

  
Are you ready Should we dive in

  
Let's do it

  
Up first

  
don't weaponize gratitude

  
Now don't get me wrong
gratitude is a great word

  
It's nice it's fluffy
a solid  points in Scrabble

  
However let's be clear

  
Although gratitude feels warm and fuzzy

  
it's not a form of currency

  
Women are assigned  percent more work

  
and spend more time on unrewarded

  
unrecognized and nonpromotable tasks

  
Basically what this means is

  
all the things men don't want to do
are being handed to women

  
and a lot of those things largely include
things that advance inclusivity

  
equity and diversity in the workplace

  
So hear me when I say

  
a woman shouldn't be grateful
to sit at a table

  
She should be paid to sit at a table

  
(Applause)

  
Especially ones she largely helped build

  
And a woman's seat shouldn't be threatened
if she doesn't seem "grateful" enough

  
In other words corporations

  
this step involves a woman doing a job

  
and being paid in money
opportunity and promotion

  
not just gratitude

  
And women  yeah go ahead
live it up live your life

  
(Applause)

  
And women a moment of real talk

  
trust me I've been there
and I know it's so tough

  
but we have to understand
and remember that being grateful

  
and being treated fairly
are not mutually exclusive

  
I can be grateful but still know
exactly what I deserve

  
And that's the way to do it

  
(Applause)

  
Up next invest in potential

  
When investing in women

  
don’t invest in the am time slot

  
Invest in empowering something different

  
Invest in a new voice

  
Give them the support they actually need

  
Cultural change takes time and money

  
Heck it took my grandfather  years
to see that I was worthy of more

  
So a true investment is one
that values potential over proof

  
Because so often that proof
doesn't exist for women

  
Not because we aren't qualified

  
but because we haven't been
given the opportunity

  
In other words

  
if you're trying to be inclusive

  
don't give someone new
a seat made of straw

  
until they prove
they deserve a better one

  
Don't hold something
called a "prove it again" bias

  
which requires less privileged people
to constantly keep proving themselves

  
even though white men tend to get by
on just their potential

  
Give them a seat that they can thrive in

  
that they can do the job
you hired them to do in

  
Allow them to contribute to the table

  
and they will make it better

  
Up next this is my favorite one

  
My favorite one it's quite
common sense actually

  
Make space for us

  
You know for every three men at a table

  
there's only one
place setting for a woman

  
People are so used to more men
showing up that they plan for it

  
There's an extra seat in the corner
there's a steak under the heat lamp

  
When more men show up
the table gets longer

  
But when that extra RSVP is a woman

  
more often than not

  
she's encouraged to compete
against the only other woman

  
that was invited to the table

  
Instead we need to build
multiple seats for multiple women

  
not just one or two

  
so that women are not sitting
on top of each other's laps

  
fighting for one meal

  
We already know that more
diverse teams perform better

  
A recent study shows

  
that corporations that have
more gender diversity

  
on their executive teams

  
were  percent more likely
to experience above average profitability

  
And more racially diverse companies
had  percent more profit

  
So really no matter how you look at it

  
it's time to build
longer tables and more seats

  
And I want to say something

  
and I want to admit something
I want to be vulnerable for a second

  
Because I've fallen victim
to this so many times

  
and women let me know
if you've experienced this

  
We have to get rid of the scarcity mindset
and champion each other

  
you know because I've learned
what's the better win

  
Me sitting at a table

  
or us sitting at a table

  
Don't be convinced to fight for one spot

  
Instead fight for multiple spots

  
(Applause)

  
And let me lead by example
right now and say

  
I know there’s many other women
that are going to come on this stage

  
and I hope they all nail it
and I will be cheering you all on

  
because we can all win

  
And I'm going to be your biggest
cheerleader when you're up here

  
(Applause)

  
Last it's time to upgrade the table talk

  
Now I believe stories
make the world go around

  
You thought it had something
to do the solar system

  
Joke's on you it's stories

  
(Laughs)

  
Stories are how we understand ourselves

  
how we understand others
and how we understand the world

  
And arguably the most important stories
are those we see in the media

  
Because we’ve seen time and time
that they control the narrative

  
and impact culture

  
Now when it comes to genre

  
you can argue that certain genres
have certain target demographics

  
When it comes to the world news
the target demographic is the world

  
and we know half of the world is female

  
Yet women and girls make up only
a quarter of the people interviewed

  
or that the news is even about
in the first place

  
Instead when it comes to issues
that impact women

  
we not only need to be included
in the coverage

  
we need to be driving those stories
and dimensionalizing our own experience

  
Inviting everyone in on the table talk
isn't just a nice gesture

  
It makes for better more productive
smarter conversation

  
with more than one point of view

  
And that's how you get better

  
So this all sounds like a lot of work

  
And it is

  
But I'm going to tell you
why it's necessary and worth it

  
To be honest this is about so much more
than just women in the workplace

  
In fact I could probably come up
with many more guidelines

  
across many other industries

  
This is about creating a world
where half of the population can thrive

  
You see because the work we do today

  
can create a world
where future generations of girls

  
can have equitable access and opportunity

  
And here's the best part
Are you ready for it

  
Everyone listening today
all the men the women

  
everyone in between the big companies
the small ones the media outlets

  
the people that snuck
into the back all of you

  
you can help create this future

  
A future where we have longer tables

  
and more seats that actually work

  
instead of fighting for a seat
at the old ones that don't

  
A future where everyone
is seated at the table equally

  
And a future

  
where being assigned female at birth
is not a disappointment

  
or a disadvantage

  
because girls are encouraged

  
empowered and expected to do great things

  
And I can't wait to make that a reality

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Growing up in a workingclass town
in upstate New York

  
I was taught to hope for a future
with a husband and two kids

  
How about you

  
I saw women in my community
marry as a path to economic security

  
but often end up with discontent
and even abuse instead

  
As I got older

  
I came to wonder and I ask you now

  
What is family

  
What do we want family to be

  
The nuclear family has been the basis
for our cultural stories and our laws

  
But only about half
of US adults are married

  
Fewer every year

  
Forty percent of US adults
don't live with a romantic partner at all

  
As of 

  
less than half of US children
had two married heterosexual parents

  
in their first marriage

  
The majority of us are not in a nuclear
family with a spouse and kids

  
Yet somehow

  
we treat this majority of people
like social failures

  
What’s worse

  
our laws treat unmarried people
as lesser citizens

  
Marriage comes with over  rights
and benefits under federal law

  
These include the ability
to get your spouse citizenship

  
share health insurance
get better tax rates

  
and inherit taxfree at death and more

  
Part of the winning argument
for samesex marriage

  
was that we shouldn't deprive gay couples
of all of these essential benefits

  
But I ask you

  
why should anyone be denied benefits
because they're in a romantic relationship

  
of which some people disapprove

  
Or because they're single

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
Or because they're basing family

  
on something other
than a romantic relationship

  
like coparenting a child

  
Our laws should move away from the idea
that there's one ideal family form

  
and value all families as they exist

  
(Applause)

  
That's what I've dedicated my career to

  
and today I'll share some of my visions

  
for how we can change US laws
to benefit all families

  
but also how an expansive view of family

  
will strengthen all
of your own relationships

  
For nearly  years with my law firm
for LGBTQ and nonnuclear families

  
I've supported same sex couples

  
But also the many family
forms beyond marriage

  
like platonic partners
who are raising a child together

  
or sharing finances
without a romantic relationship

  
Or grandparents who are raising
their grandchildren

  
Or a lesbian couple
coparenting with a male friend

  
Or polyamorous partners

  
who might be in a committed
relationship of three or four

  
Within that legal advocacy

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
and then help them design
their own family agreements

  
With the nonprofit
organization I founded

  
Chosen Family Law Center

  
I advocate for changes in US laws

  
to benefit this whole beautiful spectrum
of family constellations

  
And it is my core belief
that no matter how you form family

  
actively discussing
how we intend to live together

  
is the best thing we can do to strengthen
our own personal relationships

  
So how did we end up with this current
US emphasis on nuclear family

  
Most of us throughout history have lived
in large extended family networks

  
and  percent of the world
population does today

  
The nuclear family is actually
a relatively new development

  
It emerged in the industrial revolution

  
to support a working dad
and a homemaker mom

  
It peaked in the s and 's

  
but it hasn't been the most common
family form before or since

  
Still somehow it's the basis
for our health insurance system

  
How well is that working out

  
And a reason for our lack
of affordable childcare in this country

  
We still build and zone suburban homes
with this fictional family in mind

  
In Western Europe where I live
and in many other countries

  
states provide support
for citizens in need

  
including parents who are home
with young children

  
such as paid maternity leave

  
and financial support throughout
the childhood if needed

  
But in US law

  
we make sure that financial safety net
happens between spouses

  
rather than between citizen and state

  
US marriage is a social
welfare state of two

  
I'd rather a different social
welfare state personally

  
This leaves many people especially women

  
stuck in unhealthy relationships

  
So at this point

  
we can evaluate how samesex partnership

  
when we move into that movement
for same sex marriage

  
there was really an emphasis

  
on whether we should be
pushing for gay marriage

  
so that gay people could get
the benefits of marriage

  
or whether we should be working
to protect the rights of the unmarried

  
And we can do both

  
It's time now to protect
the rights of unmarried people

  
and other kinds of family constellations

  
(Applause)

  
Because the reality is
there's no evidence

  
that the nuclear family model
is actually the best one

  
Research has consistently shown

  
that children need stability
of parental figures

  
But from what I've consistently found

  
it doesn't matter
if that stability is mom and dad

  
two dads mom and grandma

  
or three polyamorous partners

  
So this is not only about justice

  
This is about what's best for children

  
If we really want that stability for kids

  
we need to provide support for all
the kinds of families that kids are in

  
rather than try and fail

  
to push people into a nuclear family model
with government benefits

  
It's time to observe
what's not working and change course

  
My definition of family

  
is people who are committed
to be there for each other

  
no matter what

  
This includes chosen family

  
regardless of biological relationship
or legal marriage

  
Many Black families in the US
have chosen aunties and uncles

  
with no blood relation

  
but a decision to be family
and a commitment to the children involved

  
Countless LGBTQ people
create chosen family

  
when they're rejected
by their family of origin

  
or when wanting to create
families that share their values

  
I am one of those queer people
to find home with chosen family

  
I grew up in a Christian family
in a small town

  
the only child of wonderful older parents

  
When I came out as bisexual

  
then as polyamorous
then as gender nonbinary

  
most of my blood relations
and over  cousins stopped talking to me

  
That's pretty standard

  
When I was a broke something
starting my law practice

  
I was diagnosed with cervical cancer

  
And realized that I'd been duped
into buying a health insurance

  
that didn't cover cancer

  
I was in a desperate
lifethreatening situation

  
And while my parents were loving

  
they couldn't provide me
with material support or problemsolving

  
So I broke through my shame
and my embarrassment

  
about asking for help

  
And I reached out
to my communities of friends

  
And I discovered that they were eager
to more actively support one another

  
They made a schedule

  
so there was always
someone there to cook to clean

  
to make phone calls
about my health coverage

  
or just sit with me while I cried
in my grief and my fear

  
When I won my appeal to receive coverage
by the Cancer Services Medicaid program

  
the administrator called and said

  
"I don't know who you are
but a lot of people love you"

  
(Applause)

  
And then she said "And I'd like them
to stop calling my office now please

  
Let them know you got coverage it's done

  
Thank you"

  
(Laughter)

  
The chosen family who stepped up for me

  
probably saved my life

  
But they wouldn't necessarily be able
to visit me in the hospital

  
or cross a border
in a pandemic to be with me

  
Because relationships beyond blood
and beyond marriage

  
often don't get those rights

  
And since then my life's work
has been to change that and I will

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
When we embrace the idea of chosen family

  
our own free will is more important
than biological connection

  
We can choose to create
family relationships

  
with the people who provide us
with the meaningful support

  
that we need and deserve

  
Samesex parenting has also advanced
the concept of family beyond biology

  
because in a same sex couple

  
only one parent's providing
the sperm or the egg

  
In my familybuilding legal work
with these families

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
before designing that legal agreement

  
For example

  
I’ll often work with a female
samesex couple

  
who has a male friend
who wants to "help" them become parents

  
So I'll facilitate discussions
to make sure they're all clear

  
on whether he's going to be
a coparent or a sperm donor

  
and design a legal agreement either way

  
Without that I've seen
too many situations of ambiguity

  
Where mom calls him a dad
when she needs childcare help

  
but a donor when it comes time
to make a big decision

  
she doesn't want his input on

  
He calls himself dad
when the baby's adorable at the park

  
but feels more like a donor
when the school bill comes you know

  
When we're designing our own families

  
we need clear written agreements

  
especially if children are involved

  
Let's say I have two clients
Sharon and Bill

  
best friends who are considering
becoming coparents

  
Sharon's turned 

  
and hasn't found the right man
with whom to marry and have kids

  
Neither has her gay bestie Bill

  
who can’t afford the $
surrogacy process by himself

  
So they call each other their Plan B

  
I would facilitate discussions with them
about their parenting values

  
their plans to share
finances for the child

  
their ideal week of childcare split

  
But the conversation
often gets more difficult

  
when I ask questions like

  
"Are you willing to live in the same city
for the next  years

  
to each be near the child"

  
We're used to the idea
of sacrificing for a spouse

  
and saying "no" to a dream job
in a different city

  
to stay close to each other

  
But it's a shocking idea
to do that for your buddy

  
But by becoming coparenting partners

  
they need to elevate their level
of commitment from friends

  
to platonic partners

  
They need to consciously say “goodbye”
to a Prince Charming fantasy

  
and welcome and embrace a new reality

  
of a beautiful partnership
grounded in their longterm friendship

  
and agree that this coparenting
relationship will come first

  
I have found in my work

  
that these kinds of discussions
are much more powerful

  
for preventing future disputes
than any written contract can be

  
We need to have these conversations

  
Legal contracts are sometimes written
to avoid looking eye to eye

  
and coming to agreement

  
But family contracts should only
be written after you've done that

  
When I design relationships

  
for polyamorous triads of three
or quads of four

  
I sometimes use existing legal structures

  
like trusts or LLCs

  
that allow you to share
property and finances

  
without a question
as to your relationship

  
So for example if I've got
a polyamorous triad

  
Ayesha Susan and Linda

  
I can set up an LLC for them

  
so that they can coown
real estate properties

  
pay taxes together

  
purchase a common health insurance

  
and have clear
exit strategies if they wish

  
(Applause)

  
And if people trust each other enough

  
to pool their financial fortune
and want to pay taxes together

  
it shouldn't matter
whether they're business partners

  
siblings or romantic partners

  
All of those families are valid

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
We should be able to choose legal partners

  
beyond a single romantic
partner like a spouse

  
Some people are doing that now

  
and it's the trend for the future

  
Domestic partnerships have been used
for  years by samesex couples

  
but also by best friends and siblings

  
Doing so as domestic partners
allows you to share your health insurance

  
to visit each other in the hospital

  
and across borders
in a pandemic like spouses

  
But unlike spouses you don't become
a social welfare state of two

  
which can be a good thing

  
I had a client who had
a severely disabled sister

  
By becoming domestic partners

  
she was able to put her sister

  
on her excellent
health insurance coverage

  
Why would a sister be any less worthy
of that than a boyfriend

  
Right

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
We've built on that history

  
In  my organization
helped pass the first laws

  
for multipartner domestic partnership

  
which have passed
in several cities and counting

  
This means that three
or four polyamorous partners

  
could become domestic partners

  
or two or more platonic coparents

  
or any two three or four people

  
who want to become
each other's legal partners

  
When relationships
have legal status like this

  
it reduces discrimination and promotes
social acceptance and awareness

  
as we saw in the samesex
partnership movement

  
Still we hope this year to pass

  
the first family status
nondiscrimination laws

  
at city levels across the United States

  
which means that you
can't be discriminated against

  
you can't be fired from your job
or denied housing

  
because of your family configuration

  
(Applause)

  
In future

  
I propose that we move from these
citylevel domestic partnerships

  
to statelevel multipartner
domestic partnerships

  
and then federal recognition

  
as we did with samesex marriage

  
And if we really want
to value families as they exist

  
rather than incentivize marriage

  
I also suggest that we separate out
some of the legal perks of marriage

  
so that single people and other kinds
of families get these benefits

  
without an evaluation of whether
they're in a romantic relationship

  
that passes muster

  
And marriage should not be the gateway
to social and economic privilege anymore

  
That time is done

  
And marriages will be stronger
when we do that

  
Do you know anyone who got married
faster than they should have

  
for health insurance or citizenship

  
Because I know too many
and I’m a divorce lawyer

  
(Laughter)

  
As a divorce lawyer
relationships last longer

  
when we marry for better reasons
than government perks

  
So many of you may be married

  
and may not think that these issues
have personal relevance for you

  
But I ask you to reflect

  
Could your relationship be stronger

  
if you adopted a more
expansive view of family

  
Marriage and partnership
are not onesizefitsall

  
Every couple in partnership benefits

  
from actively deciding how they want
to cocreate together

  
in terms of coparenting shared finances

  
your household

  
and your definition of monogamy

  
For example

  
is there any hidden expectation
that you have with your partner

  
that would benefit from being
spoken out loud and confirmed

  
I bet there is

  
Or is there any aspect of partnership
that you participate in

  
just because everyone does it

  
like sleeping in the same bed
or only vacationing together

  
that just isn't really working
for your partnership

  
When we expect any one relationship
in our lives to meet most of our needs

  
we may be putting too much pressure
on that relationship

  
And whether it's your romantic partner
your parent your adult child

  
your relationship may be stronger

  
if you also strengthen
other connections in your lives

  
and find other ways to get
some of your own needs met

  
(Applause)

  
My husband does not want
to help me process

  
I have other people for that in my life

  
So 

  
I think it's worthwhile to question

  
no matter what kind of family
configuration you're in

  
whether you could be part of a movement
for greater interconnectedness

  
beyond our romantic relationships
and beyond the walls of our home

  
Your family and your community
will be stronger when you do

  
Is there a longterm friend
that you could reach out to

  
with whom you'd like to be better in touch

  
and suggest a regular date
for a special time together

  
Could you create a childcare cooperative
with other parents in your community

  
Is there a single parent
or elderly person in your life

  
whose home you could spend more time in

  
At some point in a long life

  
you too will need support

  
And it benefits you
to practice asking for support now

  
and actively caring
for people in community

  
who may one day care for you

  
A baby whose diaper you change
may one day change yours

  
(Audience murmurs and laughs)

  
Sorry

  
It's the beautiful reciprocity
of human relationship

  
And in my vision for the future

  
while we work together
to redefine family in law

  
we can all redefine family
in our own culture and lives

  
There may even be a close friend
to whom you get the courage to ask

  
Do you want to make family with me

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
In the s American industrialist 
Henry Ford had one overwhelming obsession

  
soybeans

  
He extracted their oil to make enamel 
for painting his cars

  
He crushed them into powder
to make plastic parts

  
And he encouraged American farmers 
to grow as much of the plant as possible

  
But he wasn’t just feeding soy 
to machines

  
At the Chicago World’s Fair
he hosted a soycentric feast

  
The ingredient had been a staple
in Asian cuisine for centuries

  
but Ford’s dinner— full of soy substitutes
for dairy meat and wheat—

  
took the integration of soy
into food a step further

  
Today soy is in so many foods 
that most people consume it every day

  
without even knowing it

  
So what makes soybeans so versatile

  
And is our global obsession
healthy or harmful

  
Soybeans have been cultivated in Asia
as early as  years ago

  
but since then they’ve spread 
across the globe

  
Part of soy’s success is that 
the crop can be grown easily and cheaply

  
in variable conditions

  
And once they’re grown

  
soybeans have an incredibly high density
of proteins and fats;

  
ingredients which in recent years
have been used in everything

  
from mayonnaise to biodegradable plastic

  
The ideal method
for separating these components

  
depends on what you’re trying to extract

  
To isolate soy proteins dehulled beans 
are sometimes pressed through rollers

  
to create thin flakes and then steeped 
in water to draw out the proteins

  
Alternatively whole beans can be simply
soaked and ground

  
into a whitish protein rich liquid

  
In both cases the resulting substance 
can be used to make spongy foods

  
like tofu or filtered to produce soymilk

  
And at the industrial scale

  
these proteins can be used in various ways
to help make processed foods

  
Soy fats may be even more versatile

  
In one extraction method

  
soybeans are dried cleaned 
and then fed into an extruder

  
This machine simultaneously heats
and presses the beans

  
producing a liquid containing soy oil
and other fatty components

  
By adding water and spinning the mixture
components are separated into two parts

  
refined soy oil for things like salad
dressing and a substance called lecithin

  
Lecithin is made of molecules
called phospholipids

  
which have a phosphate head that attracts
water and a tail that attracts fats

  
These features make phospholipids
excellent for blending ingredients

  
that naturally separate from each other

  
This process is called emulsification

  
and soy lecithins are used 
as an emulsifying agent

  
in a huge variety of foods

  
For example during chocolate production

  
phospholipids attach to both the fatty
components of the cocoa butter

  
and the watersoluble sugar particles

  
making them easier to combine
into a smooth mixture

  
A similar process happens 
in powdered products

  
that need to be instantly rehydrated

  
Soy lecithin bonds with the water

  
and helps the powder 
disperse more quickly

  
While there are other plants 
we can process for lecithin and proteins

  
soy’s mild taste 
and widespread availability

  
have earned it a place 
in thousands of food products

  
But is it unhealthy to be eating
this much soy

  
Not really

  
Soybeans contain many of the essential
amino acids our bodies need

  
making them one of the best ways 
to get these proteins without eating meat

  
And the beans’ fat content is largely
made up of socalled “good” fats—

  
poly and monounsaturated fatty acids

  
which can decrease cholesterol 
and reduce the risk of heart disease

  
There are some compounds in soy

  
that may inhibit our body’s absorption
of various minerals

  
And about % of the general population
has a soy allergy

  
which can be severe in rare cases

  
But for many people the biggest complaint
about soy consumption

  
is the occasional increase in flatulence

  
Outside our bodies however
soy is much more worrying

  
To accommodate the soy farms needed
for heavy industry

  
processed foods and livestock feed 
huge swaths of land have been deforested

  
Between  and  roughly
 square kilometers of the Amazon

  
were cleared for soy production

  
In some regions this has also led
to the displacement of farmers

  
and indigenous communities

  
So if we want to keep using soy
and all its byproducts

  
we’ll need to find a way 
to do it humanely and sustainably

  
Pasture is the single
largest type of land

  
on the surface of the Earth today

  
thanks to our taste for meat and dairy

  
Just over a quarter of all land
is used for livestock

  
That's more than forests
or farm fields or anything else

  
Most of that land is best for ruminants

  
such as cows

  
that can digest highfiber feed
such as grass and straw

  
However the process by which grass
and fiber is broken up

  
in the stomachs of cows
and other grazing ruminants

  
has a byproduct methane

  
a potent greenhouse gas

  
Despite what you might have heard
about methane and cows

  
most of the methane
is actually burped out

  
not through the back end

  
(Laughter)

  
And that represents
about two billion tons

  
of carbon dioxide equivalent per year

  
or more than four percent of our annual
global greenhouse gas emissions

  
We have a methane problem from cows

  
So how can you reduce these methane burps

  
My colleagues and I
may have found a solution

  
Seaweed!

  
Let me explain

  
A couple of years ago

  
an article was published
by Rob Kinley and colleagues

  
that showed almost complete
elimination of methane

  
when seaweed was added
to chopped grass in the lab

  
Great

  
But as an agricultural researcher

  
I know lots of additives
work well in the lab

  
but not in real animals

  
But there was something
different about seaweed

  
and the way in which it reduced methane

  
So we thought we should
test this in live animals

  
In collaboration with Joan Salwen

  
an entrepreneur

  
and colleagues from
James Cook University and CSIRO

  
we decided to conduct a small experiment

  
to determine the amount of seaweed
we might need to use

  
This was the first ever
experiment in dairy cattle

  
and we had no idea how much to give them

  
So we started with about  grams per day

  
going up to  grams

  
Mind you this was mixed in
with  kilograms of their feed

  
One of the graduate students
I work with Breanna Roque

  
trapped their methane burps

  
(Laughter)

  
In that first experiment

  
the emissions were reduced
by up to  percent

  
(Applause)

  
And I thought at first

  
the equipment must have
malfunctioned but it was real

  
But we are left with more
questions than answers

  
Would the microbes
in the gut get used to it

  
and start producing methane over time

  
Would the seaweed be stable
over a long period of time in storage

  
Would the taste be affected
and the cows turn up their noses

  
Or would the seaweed affect
the cows's health or milk production

  
So we teamed up again
to conduct another trial

  
Over a fivemonth period

  
we saw the seaweed
that was harvested three years prior

  
reduce emissions by over  percent

  
(Applause)

  
Our colleagues in Australia

  
they saw up to  percent
reduction in a similar trial

  
That kind of reduction
is simply staggering

  
And in the graph

  
you see methane emissions
in three levels of intake

  
So the first line
is for cattle with no seaweed

  
The second line is for cows

  
that were supplemented
with about  to  grams of seaweed

  
And the last one is for cows

  
supplemented with
about  to  grams of seaweed

  
As you can see as you increase
the amount of seaweed

  
you see a reduction in methane emissions

  
We have also seen
an improvement in bulking up

  
of the beef cattle
with no adverse health effects

  
So it’s a win for the environment;

  
it's a win for the farmers and consumers

  
A panel of  people got to taste steak

  
made from steers offered
seaweed and control

  
And they did not detect any difference

  
We also did a nutritional
quality of the meat

  
and we found no difference between
animals that were offered seaweed

  
and the control

  
So how does it work

  
Some seaweeds contain ingredients

  
that directly inhibit microbes
in the cow’s gut from forming methane

  
without interfering with food digestion

  
The amount of methane produced

  
is dependent on how much
the animal is eating

  
and what's in the diet

  
And as such

  
previous efforts to reduce
methane emissions

  
focused on changing their diets

  
or improving forage quality

  
And we do have potential solutions
other than seaweed

  
to reduce methane emissions

  
We looked at additives to feed
such as NOPs

  
reduce emissions by about  percent

  
Even garlic and citrus extract

  
can reduce methane burps
by over  percent

  
without affecting
animal health and productivity

  
Now you may ask

  
Why not stop eating
beef and drinking milk

  
Audience member Yeah!

  
(Laughter)

  
EK That would be a good question

  
So adopting a plantbased diet
with supplements

  
may help shrink
a person's carbon footprint

  
in highincome countries like the US

  
But you know a lot of people
are not going to do that

  
And for the rest of the world

  
these foods are needed
to provide key nutrients

  
such as vitamin B and vitamin A

  
which are critical for brain function

  
for vision and immunity

  
These are found almost exclusively
in beef and milk

  
In this graph you see different countries

  
with their annual meat consumption
per capita on the bar graph

  
and then you see the dots
representing the stunting rate

  
in children below the age
of five years old

  
And countries that have lower
consumption of methane

  
are associated with higher
incidence of stunting

  
I know this firsthand

  
Growing up in Eritrea

  
I loved milk and meat
when you could get it

  
which wasn't often

  
Even as a kid I always wondered

  
how a cow eating just grass
produces nutritious milk I love to drink

  
And that wonder pushed me
into a career to understand

  
and improve livestock production

  
so that people in lowincome countries
do not suffer with stunting

  
and other nutrientdeficiency diseases

  
(Applause)

  
So what now

  
We know seaweed can work

  
But the cultivation of the specific
seaweed has been a barrier

  
It's not so easy to farm
asparagopsis taxiformis

  
But there are a number of efforts
going on at the moment

  
to scale up production

  
Blue Ocean Barns is growing
seaweed in Hawaii already

  
and they estimate that there will be
enough production to feed all cattle

  
in the US by 

  
All we need now
is for governments to step up

  
and facilitate the use
of these methanebusting feed additives

  
Cattle industries in some countries

  
have already committed
to climate neutrality by 

  
But if we can get these
feedadditive innovations

  
into cow stomachs earlier

  
we can cut methane burps significantly

  
Given that methane only lasts
in the atmosphere for a decade or so

  
we could even slow global warming
in the short term

  
Yes we have a methane problem from cows

  
but we may have seaweed
and other solutions

  
for these methane burps

  
helping us provide meat and dairy
while maintaining a safe climate

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
If you've gone to a tech conference

  
literally any tech conference
in the last five years

  
you would walk away with the impression
that the connected easytonavigate

  
clean and green smart city
is just around the corner

  
The reality and the hype is

  
that many companies are working
on products and solutions to get there

  
Take transportation for example

  
Allegedly in the city of the future

  
you will be able to seamlessly plan
your journey from public transportation

  
to shared autonomous taxis
and even electric scooters

  
If you own a car it will be electric

  
and there will be charging stations
strategically placed throughout the city

  
So all you do is type
your location into your GPS

  
and it will automatically
take you to your location

  
in the minimum amount of time

  
and any payment you need for charging

  
will be done automatically
in the background

  
Now you might say wait a minute

  
there are companies
that are doing this today

  
I can do this today

  
But it’s individual companies

  
and it's certainly not ubiquitous
across the city

  
But it doesn't just stop
with transportation

  
Let's take health

  
In the future there will be airquality
monitors at every street corner

  
and they will be connected
with your asthma inhaler

  
so that you know when it's safe to go out

  
Or there will be infrared cameras

  
that are measuring the temperature
of citizens anonymously

  
and that will be connected
with your thermometer

  
so that we can detect future outbreaks

  
And of course you will also have
your wearable device

  
that connected to your bathroom scale
and your smart refrigerator

  
so that nutritionists doctors
and other companies

  
can come up with new ways
to keep you you know

  
slim and and trim as I am

  
Then of course there's shopping

  
I mean when you shop today you know

  
you purchase from different retailers

  
and you receive multiple shipments
during the course of the day

  
Now if you had an app
where you could set your preferences

  
and those shipments can be consolidated

  
and maybe you receive
fewer shipments during the week

  
a little bit less convenient

  
but you get to reduce
your carbon footprint

  
So these are all great ideas
and solutions and products

  
that companies are working on

  
but they all share
an underlying requirement

  
that could make that smart city

  
more of a distant dream
than a reality just around the corner

  
And that is the need for greater sharing
of data across companies

  
individuals and cities

  
And if there's one thing
that we've learned

  
is that companies
don't like to share data

  
they don't even like to share
our own data with us

  
So let alone data
with competitors or partners

  
And therein lies the dilemma

  
because if we want to have a chance
at really combating climate change

  
we need to have our cities become
as smart and as connected

  
as quickly as possible
and as many cities as possible

  
So we need to overcome
this fear of data sharing

  
and move towards the smartcity future

  
But why is it that companies
fear sharing data

  
Well it’s what I call “FOMA”

  
Not FOMO

  
the fear of missing out
on a great party or either opportunity

  
but FOMA the fear of missing out
on competitive advantage

  
Data is a source of competitive advantage

  
So why would companies want to give it up

  
In our research over the last two years

  
we've been looking
at many different solutions

  
that would improve the citizen experience

  
and as well sustainability
solutions for cities

  
And what we found is that  percent
of those solutions

  
require much more data sharing

  
across companies individuals and cities

  
So the question really comes

  
how do we motivate companies
to share more of their data

  
We need to actually
overcome this fear quickly

  
if we want to make meaningful
progress on climate change

  
Well as we talked
to a number of companies

  
that were building platforms
and ecosystems in different verticals

  
like logistics transportation

  
smart buildings smart cities

  
we asked about what it would take
to drive greater data sharing

  
across these different solutions

  
And what we heard were the usual concerns

  
data sharing is costly it’s complicated

  
And companies were concerned
about unintended disclosures

  
that could risk their brand

  
However there was one exception

  
And this I think is promising

  
Companies were more willing
to share their data

  
if it could serve a broader common purpose
beyond commercial motivations

  
And in particular

  
they're more willing to share their data
beyond their own four walls

  
if that data sharing could help
fight climate change

  
Let's take for example
a few car companies

  
that actually are fierce competitors

  
and they got together

  
and started to share detailed mapping data

  
so they could develop better solutions
for routing trucks

  
so they spend less time idling

  
and also could route trucks in a city

  
based on prevailing
wind patterns to reduce smog

  
These are pretty cool solutions
that companies are working on

  
But the real question is

  
if this common purpose
of fighting climate change

  
can help leaders overcome
their data sharing FOMA

  
how do we get them to actually do it

  
Well in our work we found
that it takes three actions

  
to jumpstart a virtuous cycle
of data sharing and innovation

  
First companies need to look for new
unexpected sources of data

  
Second they need to develop new
sustainability solutions quickly

  
And third they need to act
together for change

  
Let's take finding new
unexpected partners for data

  
Well what I mean by that

  
is looking well beyond
the four walls of a company

  
for sources of data that can be combined
with a company's own

  
to analyze and develop
new sustainability solutions

  
But let me give a specific example

  
Let's take farming

  
Farming historically
has been more art than science

  
You've had farmers that make
decisions on when to plant

  
what fertilizer to apply
when to irrigate etc

  
based on their own personal experience
and knowledge of the farm

  
Do you remember "Star Trek"

  
and when Spock could scan
the surface of a planet

  
to know what the habitat was
using the sensors from the “Enterprise”

  
and they could tell whether the planet
could support human life

  
Well I know I'm dating myself
and I'm a bit of a geek

  
but that science fiction
is becoming a reality today

  
You have data from satellites

  
from drones from sensors on the field

  
from connected farming equipment
that is collecting data

  
All of that can be combined

  
so that farmers can make
better realtime decisions on

  
how to improve their overall crop yield

  
reduce the amount of fertilizer
and other chemicals they need

  
and also conserve
scarce resources like water

  
So they can improve their income

  
lower their costs

  
and now they can even start
generating new income sources

  
by planting carbonabsorbing crops
and getting paid for that

  
So really quite fascinating
what's happening in agriculture

  
Next comes innovating quickly
new sustainability solutions

  
What I'm talking about is not
your typical long product road map

  
but we need to have companies
hire data scientists

  
that can analyze all these
different data sources

  
and in new agile ways

  
bring new products and services to market

  
We need to use data and digital quickly
to fight climate change

  
Finally acting together

  
Now let me come back
to the smartcity example

  
If we had transportation
companies and utilities

  
and buildings share data with the city

  
then the city could make better decisions
on investing in renewable energy projects

  
That could mean that you lower
your energy bill

  
and also reduce your carbon footprint

  
Or that transportation data
can be used to decide

  
where charging stations are needed

  
so that we can accelerate the speed
of adoption of electric vehicles

  
And that means maybe you spend
less time in traffic

  
but also your air is cleaner

  
So to really make progress
on more sustainable energy

  
we need to have data sharing across
buildings transportation and utilities

  
All of this data sharing needs to come
together for a brighter future

  
Now 

  
You also have a critical role to play

  
Of course we individually need to be
in control of our own data

  
Imagine you have an app
that allows you to set preferences

  
so that data from your car
from your utilities

  
from your shopping patterns can be shared

  
and you can make decisions
about your own carbon footprint

  
in a very easy way

  
So you can run "what if" scenarios

  
What if I purchase an electric car

  
What if I take the train
from Boston to New York versus fly

  
Or what if I change my shopping pattern
so I shop more locally

  
How much will that impact
my overall carbon footprint

  
Would you be willing to share more data

  
to have more sustainable climate

  
and to make those
climatefriendly decisions

  
Well I for one I'm pretty
excited about this future

  
a future where greater data sharing

  
can really help us
jointly combat climate change

  
What we need is for company leaders
to move away from FOMA

  
and back to good oldfashioned FOMO

  
The future is bright
if all that data can be shared

  
and I don't think
we really want to miss out

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
On October st   residents 
of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood

  
approached William Simpson
who’d just bought a plot in the area

  
and told him to leave

  
The Simpsons would be the second 
Black family

  
in the otherwise white neighborhood  
where they intended to build a home

  
When the Simpsons refused offers 
to buy them out

  
their neighbors tried blocking
their home’s construction

  
They finally moved into their house 
but the incident had a ripple effect

  
Just a few months 
after the mob harassed the Simpsons

  
the first racially restrictive covenant
was put into place in Minneapolis

  
Covenants are agreements in property deeds
that are intended to regulate

  
how the property is to be used

  
Beginning in the mids

  
people in the United States and elsewhere
began employing them in a new way

  
specifically 
to racially restrict properties

  
They wrote clauses into deeds that were 
meant to prevent  all future owners

  
from selling or leasing 
to certain racial and ethnic groups

  
especially Black people

  
Between  and 

  
these racial covenants spread
like wildfire throughout the US

  
making cities more segregated 
and the suburbs more restricted

  
In the county encompassing Minneapolis

  
racial covenants eventually appeared 
on the deeds to more than  homes

  
Not only was this legal

  
but the US Federal Housing Administration

  
promoted racial covenants 
in their underwriting manual

  
While constructing new homes

  
real estate developers began racially
restricting them from the outset

  
Developments were planned as dream
communities for American families—

  
but for white people only

  
In  one company began building
what became widely recognized

  
as the prototype of the postwar American
suburb Levittown New York

  
It was a community 
of more than  identical homes

  
They cost around $ each 
and were intended to be affordable

  
for returning World War II veterans

  
But according to Levittown’s 
racial covenants none of the houses

  
could “be used or occupied by any person 
other than members of the Caucasian race”

  
with one exception servants

  
Between  and 

  
the population of the American suburbs
nearly doubled

  
as white people flocked 
to more racially homogenous areas

  
in a phenomenon known as “white flight”

  
The suburbs spread

  
replacing native ecosystems with miles
of pavement and waterguzzling lawns

  
And their diffuse layout necessitated
car travel

  
American automobile production quadrupled
between  and 

  
cementing the nation's dependence on cars

  
Federal programs like the GI Bill
offered American veterans

  
favorable lending rates for buying homes

  
But it was difficult for people of color
to take advantage of such resources

  
Racial covenants restricted them
from certain neighborhoods

  
And at the same time government programs
labelled neighborhoods of color

  
bad investments and often refused
to insure mortgages in those areas

  
Therefore banks usually wouldn’t lend
money to people purchasing property

  
in neighborhoods of color—
a practice that became known as redlining

  
So instead of owning homes 
that increased in value over time

  
creating wealth that could be passed
to future generations

  
many people of color were forced
to spend their income on rent

  
And even when they were<i </iable 
to buy property

  
their home’s value was less likely
to increase

  
The suburbs boasted culdesacs 
and dead ends that minimized traffic

  
Meanwhile city planners often identified
redlined neighborhoods

  
as inexpensive areas 
for industrial development

  
So the massive freeway projects 
of the midth century

  
disproportionately cut 
through redlined neighborhoods

  
accompanied by heavy industry
and pollution

  
As a result many neighborhoods of color
experience higher rates

  
of drinking water contamination asthma
and other health issues

  
People targeted by racial covenants
increasingly challenged them in court

  
and in  they were finally banned
under the Fair Housing Act

  
But the damage had been done

  
Racial covenants concentrated wealth
and amenities in white neighborhoods

  
and depressed the conditions 
and home values in neighborhoods of color

  
As of  about % of white families 
in the US owned their homes

  
while about % of Black families did

  
That gap is greatest 
in Minnesota’s Twin Cities

  
Across the country
neighborhoods remain segregated

  
and % of all suburban counties
are predominantly white

  
Some landlords real estate agents
and lenders

  
still discriminate against people 
based on race—

  
rejecting them steering them to and away 
from certain neighborhoods

  
or providing inaccessibly
high interest rates

  
Gentrification and exclusionary 
zoning practices also still displace

  
and keep people of color
out of certain neighborhoods

  
Racial covenants are now illegal

  
But they can still be seen
on many housing deeds

  
The legacy of racial covenants is etched
across the pristine lawns

  
of the American suburbs

  
It’s a footnote in the demographic divides
of every city

  
And it’s one of the insidious architects
of the hidden inequalities

  
that shape our world

  
My very first food memory
was when I was three or four

  
It was a warm day

  
and my mom had just picked me
and my sister up from school

  
buckled us into the back
of her dusty blue Ford Taurus

  
She was halfway out
of the school parking lot

  
when she pulled over to the side

  
She strangely reached for her purse
that was resting on the dashboard

  
started fishing around for something
until she found it

  
Then she twisted around to us

  
and she tore open a yellow paper bag

  
of slightly melted Sugar Babies

  
(Audience murmurs)

  
She poured a few of the pellets
into each of our tiny hands

  
Now I want to be clear

  
this was not a normal mom thing

  
This was breaking several rules

  
It was after lunch but before dinner

  
we were in the car

  
(Laughs)

  
we hadn't done anything spectacular
to be celebrated

  
And Sugar Babies are well pure sugar

  
I was so confused

  
But I was a kid so I took the candy
and I started chewing

  
God I felt like I had just been inducted
into the coolest club possible

  
The one that eats candy
on a random Wednesday

  
(Laughs)

  
And then the world it slowed down

  
Everything faded

  
And then everything sharpened

  
There is only one word
for what I felt in that moment

  
Magic

  
Real magic

  
Now most people think
that’s kind of crazy

  
three or four years old

  
I don't remember anything
about my childhood for years after that

  
but I remember that day

  
I remember those Sugar Babies

  
and I remember that feeling

  
Now most people think of magic
as a trick right

  
Abracadabra

  
This seemingly impossible act
put on purely for entertainment

  
But I'd like to challenge that

  
Magic real magic is not an illusion

  
Real magic is the feeling

  
when life transforms
from the ordinary into the extraordinary

  
And not only is it real

  
It is the very thing
that connects us to this world

  
to one another

  
to our entire existence

  
It's the spark of a moment

  
It's the feeling of believing

  
of belonging

  
of getting

  
of being gotten

  
It is the crack

  
that opens up our hearts
and reminds us to let light in

  
Now I own Milk Bar

  
this quirky Americanstyle bakery

  
that I'll tell you
a little bit about later

  
And I have found

  
that magic is often created
by breaking some sort of rule

  
Like the "no sweets before dinner" rule

  
Or wearing overalls
to a corporate board meeting

  
Or simply daring to defy the expectations
of the people around us

  
Now as a kid

  
breaking the rules usually
only got us in trouble right

  
But as adults it's a different story

  
Breaking the rules pushing boundaries

  
challenging the norm

  
asking why why not

  
It does something to us

  
It shakes us from sleepwalking

  
And it makes space for magic to sneak in

  
Now I was raised by matriarchs

  
fierce heroic grandmas
who loved to bake in their free time

  
And they knew good and well that food
was for nutrition and sustenance

  
but they didn't care

  
(Laughs)

  
They'd baked as their way
of breaking the rules

  
They'd make batches of lemon bars
instead of casseroles

  
or onepot wonders

  
And they put those baked goods in baggies

  
and hand them out

  
hand that magic out
to the most unassuming people

  
The newcomer to the neighborhood

  
the mail carrier or my personal favorite

  
the receptionist at the dentist office

  
(Laughs)

  
Now I knew what the receiving end
of magic felt like

  
from that Sugar Baby moment

  
But witnessing what the giving part
of real magic did 

  
It moved these people

  
It was aweinspiring

  
And so I decided

  
that baking would be my way
of making magic in the world

  
creating a moment and then giving it away

  
A magic pyramid scheme basically

  
that I wanted needed more of

  
Only my mom and my grandmas
thought that baking was just a hobby

  
But I knew it could be more than that

  
So I moved to New York City
to become a professional pastry chef

  
I went to culinary school;

  
I climbed the ladder of fancy restaurants

  
making fancy desserts
to become the very best of the best

  
Only 

  
I never found magic in those beautiful
delicate plated desserts

  
I could only find my magic
in a cookie or a slice of cake

  
or a gooey underbaked pie

  
And so when I opened Milk Bar

  
that bakery that I was telling you about

  
I decided I wasn't going to frost
the sides of a cake

  
like the textbooks taught me

  
(Laughter)

  
I decided I was going to load
cookie dough with marshmallows

  
or pretzels and potato chips

  
and butterscotch chips and coffee

  
tossing convention out the window

  
I wanted people to eat birthday cake
not just on their birthday

  
but any day they wanted

  
I knew that my magic came in the form
of these simple baked goods

  
but I also knew that simple
approachable accessible

  
nostalgic flavors

  
were my best jumpingoff place
to create new desserts

  
Almost as though fancy
were the enemy of delicious

  
I’d go to county fairs to nosh

  
I'd go to the diner
and order slices of pie

  
from that revolving display case

  
I'd take french fries and dip them
in chocolate milkshake and dream

  
And then I'd go into the kitchen
and tie on my apron

  
and start mixing up a new creation

  
rooted in something known
and safe and loved

  
but reaching far beyond
what anyone thought accessible

  
Or approachable

  
Or doable

  
Breaking the banking rules
became my daily ritual

  
I mean who says a layer cake can't taste
like salty malty sweet pretzels

  
I mean my culinary instructors for one

  
(Laughs)

  
"Watch me" I'd think

  
And I'd take pretzels

  
toast them in the oven
to deepen their flavor

  
then grind them
into a powderlike consistency

  
and substitute some
of the cake flour in a recipe

  
for that pretzel powder

  
It's pretty good

  
When I was opening Milk Bar
I knew I wanted to serve ice cream

  
A rebellious kind of ice cream

  
No surprise right

  
So I decided to buy a soft serve machine

  
which for the record
was very rebellious at the time

  
I had to decide what flavor to make

  
I mean why do we only accept
chocolate and vanilla

  
as ice cream flavors

  
I needed to come up
with something better different

  
Push that boundary

  
I knew I had to come up
with a flavor of milk

  
that was different

  
Milk is like the base
of any great ice cream

  
So I sat out inspiration
at my hour bodega

  
Favorite place to go

  
Because that's where we all shop

  
that's where our simple
taste buds are formed

  
it's the flavors we know

  
Up and down the aisles till I hit it

  
My favorite section
of the grocery store as a kid

  
the cereal aisle

  
Now as a kid my mom and I
had an agreement

  
I was a pretty picky eater

  
and we agreed that I could have
as much cereal as I wanted

  
as long as I drank
all the calciumrich milk

  
at the bottom of the bowl

  
I mean I thought it was highway robbery

  
Does she not understand how good
that sugary sweet milk was at the bottom

  
That's interesting

  
That's a really delicious flavor of milk

  
It moved me

  
It made sense to me

  
but would it make sense to other people

  
Figured I'd give it a try

  
So I went back to the kitchen

  
and made the equivalent
of a giant bowl of cereal

  
I strained out all that delicious milk

  
and I spun it into ice cream

  
Put it on the menu

  
And I've got to tell you even now

  
people stop me on the street

  
to tell me about their cerealmilk
ice cream moment

  
"So good"

  
"Seemingly a little naughty"

  
I mean how did I know
that was their flavor

  
That's the flavor they eat
when they're wearing pajamas

  
when no one's looking

  
The flavor of their childhood

  
These people will tell me
about every detail of the day

  
They will tell me about the weather
the company they kept

  
the way that an ordinary moment
was transformed into something magical

  
with a simple bite

  
I built my business with the same
"challenge the norm" mentality

  
Rather than measure my business's success
by the profit or loss sheet

  
by the average order value

  
the other metrics that businesses use

  
to know if they're doing well

  
I decided we'd measure our impact
by the twinkle in people's eyes

  
By the "Oh I can't put that down" feeling

  
that they had when they ate
one of our desserts

  
I chose to put women
at the helm of my organization

  
Because when I looked
around the hospitality industry

  
people running operations
folks holding CEO titles

  
they were all men

  
I mean why

  
I was raised by these fierce matriarchs
who handled business

  
and I wanted my organization
to look like that

  
I want to show the world
what women were capable of

  
and what a "bakery" could be

  
Push back on that cute little box
people like to put us in

  
And in turn the rules broke for us

  
The magic our magic got out

  
Word spread without us spending
a dollar on marketing

  
Rare in our industry

  
we grew our business
without diluting the business

  
I mean we won awards

  
no tiny East Village bakery
has any business winning

  
(Laughs)

  
It's pretty incredible

  
Even today

  
I get to witness that feeling

  
that same one that my grandmas
conjured up in my childhood

  
We ship cakes all across the country

  
we keep our doors open from early
in the morning until late at night

  
It's insane for a bakery to do

  
But we do it because we're
obsessed with it

  
We're obsessed with what we do

  
We teach classes we share recipes

  
despite any concerns of copycats

  
or intellectual property infringements

  
because that's what you do

  
when you benefit
from what came before you

  
and you plan on passing it
along long after you

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
When you know you're here
to give not take

  
and leave this place
better than you found it

  
See mom you can bake for a living

  
Pretty cool if you ask me

  
Now I don't have
the full equation cracked

  
but I do know that it starts
with the decision to act

  
My mom she could have driven
that car home routinely

  
but she decided that that day
would not be like the others

  
She threw out that rule book
for just a second

  
I carry this lesson with me

  
that every day has within it hundreds

  
thousands of opportunities
to create real magic

  
Only they disappear

  
Unless you reach out and grab them

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
A few years ago I sailed on a ship
that comes from an earlier era

  
when moving goods by sea
didn't mean polluting the planet

  
Our voyage to the Caribbean
was eyeopening

  
and not just because I learned
that apparently I’m incurably seasick

  
(Laughter)

  
I also saw what it's like

  
when you take away the diesel fumes
and the black smoke

  
that spew from today's
freighters and ports

  
Instead our vessel smelled
like fresh sea breeze

  
and the bags of cardamom we carried

  
and all that camomile tea I was chugging

  
Nearly every modern cargo ship
relies on highly polluting fossil fuels

  
Fortunately there's a way
to clean up the industry

  
beyond just reviving
oldfashioned sailing ships

  
and it's 

  
green ammonia

  
If you know anything about ammonia

  
it's probably that it's stinky
it's toxic it's potentially explosive

  
So it's a great place to start right

  
Ammonia is mainly used today
to make chemicals and fertilizers

  
But for many reasons
industry experts are convinced

  
that ammonia could be a gamechanging way
to drive giant cargo ships

  
and that it could be used safely
and be costcompetitive

  
Tens of thousands of freighters
crisscross the oceans every day

  
bringing the food we eat
the clothes we wear the cars we drive

  
Container ships alone

  
carry some four trillion dollars
worth of goods by sea every year

  
That's roughly the GDP of Germany

  
At the same time

  
the shipping industry
contributes a significant share

  
of the world's annual
greenhouse gas emissions

  
If shipping were a country

  
it'd be the sixth largest emitter of CO

  
trailing just behind Japan

  
And as world economies grow
and populations rise

  
shipping's emissions are expected to soar

  
unless the industry
charts a cleaner course

  
Green ammonia really first came
to my attention in 

  
at the UN Climate Change Conference
in Bonn Germany

  
At the panel I attended
ammonia seemed kind of like an aside

  
or something we should be keeping tabs on

  
Since then the industry
has really coalesced around ammonia

  
as the next dominant shipping fuel

  
Chemical companies and investors

  
are spending millions of dollars
to build green ammonia plants

  
and shipbuilders and manufacturers

  
are busy developing
the necessary technology

  
The first ammoniapowered ships
are just around the corner

  
So what's so special
about this pungent gas

  
Well to start ammonia doesn't contain
any carbon molecules

  
so it doesn't create carbon dioxide
when used as fuel

  
Instead it contains one part nitrogen 

  
which is the main component of air 

  
and three parts hydrogen
which is a building block of water

  
It's possible to make ammonia
without using any fossil fuels

  
That's what makes it "green" ammonia

  
Think of it like this

  
instead of the oil wells
and petroleum refineries

  
that make today's dirty diesel fuels

  
picture solar panels or wind turbines
or hydropower plants

  
Renewable electricity is the foundation
of this whole ammoniamaking ordeal

  
We can start with electrolysis

  
which uses electricity to split water
into hydrogen and oxygen

  
Then renewables can power the process
that separates nitrogen from air

  
And so with our hydrogen and nitrogen
we can combine the two

  
in an industrial process
at high temperatures

  
to make NH  ammonia

  
Now if you want to use
this ammonia to power

  
your thousandfootlong freighter

  
you have two options

  
The first is an internal
combustion engine

  
so similar to how diesel
is used in ships today

  
but with certain modifications

  
Experts think that the first vessels
to use ammonia in their engines

  
will be chemical tankers

  
because they already carry it
in their cargo holds

  
So they'll be like the early adopters

  
The next options is to use a fuel cell

  
Fuel cells create electricity
through a chemical reaction

  
and that's what drives the ship's motors
and turns the propellers

  
In Norway work is underway

  
to launch the world's first
ammoniafuelcell ship

  
in just a few years' time

  
So we can make green ammonia

  
and we can use it
in fuel cells or engines

  
The final piece of the ammonia
puzzle is the infrastructure

  
the storage facilities the pipelines
the distribution networks 

  
everything that's needed to ensure
a ship can fill its tanks

  
anywhere in the world

  
And none of this is particularly novel

  
because we already have infrastructure

  
for the chemical
and fertilizer industries

  
Now it just needs to be built near ports

  
and at a global scale 

  
and with great caution

  
So what's needed
to take ammonia mainstream

  
We can draw a rough parallel
to the rise of electric cars

  
A decade ago

  
about  EVs
were on the roads worldwide

  
Then more and more countries
adopted policies

  
encouraging people to buy EVs

  
supporting manufacturers

  
and to build up charging infrastructure

  
And as sales climbed
and production boomed

  
the cost of batteries
and other components plummeted

  
making it easier for more people
to afford electric cars

  
So now instead of  EVs
it's more like  million

  
and green ammonia
could follow a similar path

  
in the shipping industry

  
Policies to curb emissions
and incentivize green investments

  
could spur a shift away from fossil fuels

  
And as ammonia catches on

  
fuel prices and technology costs
could decline in step

  
enabling more ship operators
to make the switch

  
And while all of that is happening

  
a much bigger story will be playing out
on the global scale

  
the rising development and plunging costs
of renewable energy supplies

  
Giant offshore wind farms

  
sprawling solar arrays
and other technologies

  
could provide the electrons
needed to make that green ammonia

  
Green ammonia might be
the main fuel source

  
on future cargo ships

  
but it doesn’t have to be
the only clean technology onboard

  
Ships will likely use
a combination of tools

  
Batteries can already power
the lights and equipment on giant ships

  
and certainly smaller vessels
can be fully batterypowered today

  
Design fixes like supersleek hulls
and dolphinlike flippers

  
can improve ships' efficiency

  
And another technology
that's quickly gaining traction

  
is called "windassisted propulsion"

  
which puts a modern twist
on an old idea of harnessing wind

  
One cargo ship I sailed on
in the North Sea

  
uses devices called "rotor sails"

  
These are foottall tubes

  
that spin around
like hyperactive barber's poles

  
which produces a forward thrust

  
and reduces demand on the diesel engines

  
It's really exciting to see
these things whip around

  
but it's funny how almost blasé
the crew was about the whole thing

  
They push a button

  
the tubes swirl to life
the ships saves fuel

  
and they can all carry on
with their normal tasks

  
as we sailed from Rotterdam

  
to this industrial eyesore
in northern England

  
and back again

  
Meanwhile of course

  
I spent my time admiring the sails

  
and then curling up in the fetal position
as the sea knocked our ship around

  
The maritime industry
is at a pivotal moment

  
in its long and storied history

  
Over the last few centuries

  
fossil fuels have powered the freighters
that have transformed global trade

  
connecting cotton fields
to farflung garment factories

  
and bringing blueberries
from one side of the equator to the other

  
Coalpowered steamships made it possible
to travel farther and faster

  
and diesel engines
took this into overdrive

  
What began in the early th century
as a humble canal boat

  
puttering along with this tiny engine

  
has since become giant container ships

  
that stretch as long
as skyscrapers stand tall

  
We know that to keep the planet
from warming further

  
we must completely transform the way
that we power our homes our cars

  
and the freighters that bring us
all our precious stuff

  
The shipping industry
must join the rest of the world

  
in addressing climate change

  
and it could do that
with the help of green ammonia

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause)

  
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and wow you’re still reeling

  
You’re a particle of matter 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces

  
fusion and annihilation

  
If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter

  
you'll be the seed of a future galaxy

  
You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game

  
A friendly gluon explains

  
there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles

  
At the blow of a cosmic whistle

  
every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right

  
will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate

  
The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle

  
and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains

  
They’d been waiting for someone like you
as with a perfectly balanced setup

  
no one would be left in the end

  
As guest of honor they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring

  
What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing

  
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like

  
But we can rely on how it should end 
with you as the last particle standing

  
Let's start there and work backwards

  
Just before this there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs

  
Here’s  for the sake of example

  
This right away suggests a strategy

  
You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle

  
by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles

  
then the newly adjacent pairs and so on
to reach this final set

  
If you map them back 
to the original circle

  
standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles

  
or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles

  
means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive

  
So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles

  
You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance

  
of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy

  
You’re soon left alone

  
But wait a minute!

  
Today’s the big day

  
You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races

  
Every hundred million years

  
sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core

  
to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from

  
Each of the  attendees

  
has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter

  
Except you you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor

  
and reenact its moment of choice

  
Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring

  
Your job pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated

  
The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before

  
but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes

  
The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle

  
count cubes of each type
perform arithmetic

  
and carry out simple logical commands

  
How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots

  
Pause to figure it out for yourself
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Let’s go back to our earlier approach

  
running time backwards 
starting from you alone

  
then a sequence of pairs of cubes

  
A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes

  
As does the next and the next
each adding nestled pairs

  
like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles

  
A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate

  
Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right

  
buffering you from antimatter

  
We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum starting with your +

  
For instance this would be +++

  
From your perspective 
no matter how far you look

  
this sum will be positive

  
Considering how we introduced pairs 
this makes sense—

  
each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus

  
If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube

  
its sum will eventually hit zero

  
The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner

  
Again our introduction of pairs 
reflects this;

  
nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes

  
We can now program the device

  
Start a running sum with +
representing you

  
and scan around the circle

  
For each matter cube add one

  
and for each antimatter cube 
subtract one

  
If all  cubes have been scanned

  
without the sum ever hitting 

  
that spot is safe

  
Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks

  
Hello everyone

  
My name is Orit yes

  
And I study insurance

  
Telling people that you study insurance
is not a good way to start a conversation

  
In fact if ever you need
to end the conversation

  
try it tell people you study insurance

  
People don't want to talk about insurance

  
They don't think it's all that exciting

  
But I disagree

  
I find insurance fascinating;
in fact I find it magical

  
And today I'd like to show you why

  
Now the famous author Franz Kafka

  
used to work for an insurance
company in Prague

  
And this is what Kafka
had to say about insurance

  
He said "Insurance is like a religion

  
Insurance is like a primitive religion

  
It's the religion of people
who believe that by having insurance

  
they can ward off evil"

  
So according to Kafka

  
what leads us to buy insurance
is not rational thinking

  
but magical thinking

  
It's the belief that if I have insurance

  
somehow magically those negative events
that I fear in the future

  
they're not going to happen

  
Of course this is totally irrational

  
It's like believing
that if you have an umbrella

  
it's not going to rain

  
If your car gets stolen yes

  
the insurance company
will cushion the blow

  
With the compensation money

  
you could probably afford a new car

  
But the fact that you have insurance

  
does not make your car
less likely to be stolen

  
The risk is the same
whether you are insured or not

  
So are people this naive

  
Do they really believe
that if they have insurance

  
they are less at risk

  
Yes

  
Perhaps not consciously but they do

  
Let me show you

  
In one of my studies

  
I asked people to predict
what is the likelihood

  
that in the future they will suffer
all kinds of medical misfortunes

  
yhat they will need an operation
physiotherapy or nursing care

  
Another group was asked
to make the same predictions

  
but we first asked them

  
"Do you have health insurance"

  
And of course they do

  
Israel has universal coverage

  
Reminding people
that they have health insurance

  
had a fascinating effect

  
It made them feel less at risk

  
Surprisingly the effect
was not limited to medical problems

  
It also made them believe
that they are less likely to lose money

  
and my personal favorite

  
asking people in Tel Aviv
if they have health insurance

  
made the prospect of a war
in Europe seem less likely

  
(Laughter)

  
And that's magic

  
Kafka was right

  
There is an interesting paradox here

  
We buy insurance against those events
that we fear the most

  
But once we are armed
with this protection measure

  
we feel that we are no longer
at risk somehow magically

  
And this protection effect
is not unique to insurance policies

  
We see it with other
protection measures as well

  
Let me show you

  
In  the citizens of Israel

  
were very worried about a possible
military attack by Iran

  
And the government was distributing
gas masks to all the citizens

  
At the time we called people
and asked them to predict

  
what are the chances
that Iran would attack Israel

  
with weapons of mass destruction

  
The ratings were quite high

  
People were worried

  
But if we first asked them
"Do you have a gas mask"

  
then the ratings dropped dramatically

  
And that's magic

  
Apart from the fact
that gas masks are largely useless

  
against weapons of mass destruction

  
the fact that you have a gas mask
is unlikely to affect the strategic

  
or the tactical decision
of a foreign power

  
We have to remember

  
insurance is an antidote
it's not a vaccine

  
It doesn’t ward off evil;

  
it doesn't eliminate
the risks that we face

  
However when it comes to insurance

  
the distinction between
an antidote and a vaccine

  
somehow gets blurred in our minds

  
Why does it happen

  
It happens because people
are not that good

  
at assessing risks rationally

  
Let me give you an example

  
When I arranged my flight to come here

  
I had to decide if I wanted
to buy travel insurance

  
Rationally I should have based
this decision on several considerations

  
the price of the policy of course

  
the value of my luggage

  
the aggravation
that I'm likely to experience

  
if my luggage gets lost

  
And of course the likelihood
of such an event right

  
But most of the time we're just too busy
to make such rational calculations

  
And anyway

  
I doubt that Lufthansa are very keen
to share their damage statistics with me

  
So what do we do instead

  
We rely on our intuition

  
So how do we evaluate risks intuitively

  
We start by imagining
the outcomes that we fear

  
So here I am

  
it's late at night
I'm sitting at this airport

  
all the other passengers
already collected their luggage and left

  
I realize that my own suitcase
is now probably heading to the North Pole

  
Thinking about this scenario
creates anxiety

  
and then we use the level
of anxiety that we feel

  
in order to assess the probability

  
So if I'm feeling terrified

  
I will infer that the risk
of such an event is quite high

  
But you see this is
an intuitive risk estimate

  
It is entirely psychological
and emotionbased

  
which is why it is also highly susceptible
to the magic of insurance

  
Insurance reduces our anxiety

  
First because the outcomes
that we imagine are suddenly less grim

  
Yes I'm sitting at the airport
yes it's late at night

  
all the other passengers had left

  
but there will be this guy there
they would give me a voucher

  
eventually I will get
compensated it's OK

  
Also because we are conditioned
to associate insurance with safety

  
security tranquility and peace of mind

  
And if I'm feeling less anxious

  
I would infer that the risk
is not that high

  
So there you have it

  
I have insurance and the risk is gone

  
But why do we associate insurance
with peace of mind

  
Well first in many languages

  
this is exactly what the word
"insurance" means

  
It comes from the word "sure"
which means lack of doubts

  
no unknowns that would sneak up
and bite you in the future right

  
But also because traditionally

  
this is how insurance was promoted

  
Let me show you an example

  
This is a lovely advertising toy

  
that was distributed to visitors
at the British exhibition in 

  
So you see this guy
and he looks terrified

  
He is barraged by the bricks of doom

  
fire accident falling on his head

  
And the tag on the bottom

  
it reads "anxiety" which perfectly
describes the guy's expression

  
But if you pull on that tag

  
something slides inside
and the guy transforms

  
First he now has the protection
of the Prudential insurance helmet

  
and his expression
is changed into a smile

  
You know why

  
Because Prudential insurance
dispels anxiety

  
Modern images of insurance
convey the same message

  
Insurance logos often incorporate
supporting hand below

  
and umbrellas above ultimate protection

  
And then travel insurance ads

  
They could easily be mistaken
for vacation brochures right

  
Romantic couples
exotic islands palm trees

  
And if for some reason
you need images of smiling

  
happy people wearing white

  
do an image Google search
with the words "pension plans"

  
or "health insurance"

  
Insurance ads rarely show you
sick people smashed cars torn suitcase

  
The message is loud and clear

  
You have insurance

  
all is well in the world

  
However to get us to buy insurance

  
the promoters must also work our fears

  
Which is why right after
you paid a lot of money

  
for a top of the line refrigerator

  
the same seller who just moments ago

  
were explaining
how reliable this product is

  
is now telling you that it may
break down at any moment

  
which is why you should buy
the extended warranty

  
And with some credit cards
you could get free travel insurance

  
All you need to do is to call the agent

  
But when you make this call

  
you are told yeah but the free deal
is only for the basic plan

  
Basic plan doesn't sound
good already right

  
And then you get to hear a list of things
that you are not covered against

  
like fires and heart transplant
and floods etc

  
But if you pay one more
dollar a day right

  
And your active imagination does the rest

  
with each item on the list
your anxiety is mounting

  
and you don't ask yourself
"Hey I'm going to Paris

  
why would I care about a tsunami"

  
You pay the dollar and all is well
in the world again

  
In fact

  
just realizing that we are not
covered against something

  
is enough to distort
our perception of risk

  
I once asked people to imagine
in one of my studies

  
that they're going to go on a trip

  
and they plan to buy
travel insurance at the airport

  
But by the time they reach the counter

  
boarding had already started

  
and they have to board that airplane
painfully aware that they are not covered

  
And then I asked them to assess
all kinds of travelrelated risks

  
And these were dramatically inflated

  
compared to the ratings of people
who did have insurance

  
For example lost luggage

  
the risk of lost luggage
almost  percent

  
What are the chances
that you will need hospitalization

  
Almost  percent well  percent

  
And how about
you will need to be rescued

  
Thirtyone percent

  
I remember the first time
I saw this data I was speechless

  
I was thinking

  
"Guys if this is what you believe
why would you ever leave home"

  
you know

  
(Laughter)

  
Yeah

  
Boarding an airplane
with no insurance is tempting fate

  
It's like realizing that your insurance
policy had just expired

  
and not renewing it

  
Grave danger indeed

  
Your appliances they know you know

  
So we buy insurance
and restore our peace of mind

  
And now you're probably asking yourself

  
"But peace of mind is good

  
What's wrong with peace of mind" right

  
"What's the problem"

  
The problem is that we are highly
likely to be overinsured

  
What does it mean

  
Well first

  
we may be protecting ourselves
against really unlikely events

  
like a tsunami in Paris

  
Or we may be paying a lot
to prevent a trivial loss

  
Does it really make sense to extend
the warranty on an old washing machine

  
And if you will examine
your own policies back at home

  
many of you will find
that you have redundant coverage

  
You are paying several policies
on the same event

  
Many of you do that

  
Me included and I should know better

  
So 

  
This kind of behavior
can get people in debt

  
and even if they don't

  
this is money that we could spend
in far more pleasurable ways right

  
At least I can

  
But selling peace of mind is a problem
for the insurance companies as well

  
Why

  
The insurance companies are well aware
of the problem called “moral hazard”

  
You see when people are insured

  
they become negligent

  
They start leaving
their valuables out in the open

  
They don't check their fire alarms
they drive faster

  
In short they act in ways
which put them at greater risk

  
Now the insurance companies

  
they believe that we behave like that

  
because we know that if something happens

  
someone else will pay

  
Which is why many policies
include deductibles

  
That's the money that comes
out of your pocket right

  
So the deductibles are there to make sure

  
that some of the risk
will stay with the client

  
But based on the research
that I just shared with you

  
it is entirely possible

  
that the reason that we are careless

  
is not just that we think
that someone else will pay

  
but it's also the magical belief
that if I have insurance

  
it's not going to rain

  
The damage is not going to happen

  
and magical thinking
is not susceptible to deductibles

  
What are the lessons to be learned

  
For us for you

  
Next time you consider buying insurance

  
remember Kafka

  
Ask yourself

  
Am I buying insurance
for the right reasons

  
Am I making a sound economic decision

  
or merely trying to please my psyche

  
As for the insurance companies

  
I hope they will consider
changing their message

  
Don't sell magical happiness

  
Encourage us to buy insurance
when it is economically rational

  
and the responsible thing to do

  
And finally

  
guys I hope that next time
someone says "I study insurance"

  
you would say "Wonderful

  
Please tell me more"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Now when you think of the industries
most responsible for climate change

  
you probably summon up
an image of an oil rig right

  
Maybe even a coal mine

  
or a megafarm

  
perhaps heavy engineering

  
But there’s one industry
that’s never mentioned in that list

  
even though every other industry
depends upon it

  
I’m talking about
an economic sector that makes 

  
nothing

  
It has no stock

  
no warehouses

  
no factories

  
It’s entirely powered by brains

  
by spreadsheets

  
and by PowerPoint

  
Who is this mystery industry

  
The professional services
of advertising and PR firms

  
the big management consultancies

  
the corporate lawyers and lobbyists

  
Together this sector is worth
over two trillion dollars a year

  
Let’s call it the “X industry”

  
where X is for influence

  
Now when it comes to climate change

  
each individual firm in this sector
has the carbon footprint

  
probably no bigger
than your average kindergarten

  
But the brainprint of the X industry
is felt everywhere

  
And that’s because these problemsolvers
and storytellers act

  
as the grease in the wheel
of all other businesses on Earth

  
And that gives the X industry
an outsize influence

  
on the likelihood that we reach netzero

  
or they will be one of the primary
architects of climate destruction

  
Now how

  
Remember that oil rig
we imagined a moment ago

  
Think about how it’s actually built

  
I’ve seen this firsthand

  
It takes a village of X industry
advisers to raise a rig

  
First 

  
often

  
the oil exploration proposals
are financially modeled

  
by one of the big constultancies

  
Then the lobbying firms
push through regulatory approval

  
often years if not decades ahead
of a single drop of oil being pumped

  
Then the PR agencies

  
they come in and they work
to get local communities onside

  
And the legal firms
squash any legal objection

  
Finally the creative agencies
craft influence campaigns

  
to help sell the image of the oil industry

  
and to sell the product itself

  
Oil companies know how to drill for oil

  
but they’ve outsourced
almost everything else

  
to this army of publicists
and consultants

  
to lawyers and to lobbyists

  
We all remember the Deepwater
Horizon disaster of 

  
when BP polluted the Gulf of Mexico

  
with over four million barrels of oil

  
What you might not know

  
is that BP admitted

  
to spending three times as much
on promotional advertising

  
in the year after the disaster
than in the year before

  
And arguably

  
the X industry has done
a better job of cleaning up BP’s image

  
than BP has yet done cleaning up
the Gulf of Mexico

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Oh come on come on

  
Is it really fair for me to hold
the X industry responsible

  
for the environmental impact
of their clients

  
There is no official way
to do so just yet

  
We recognize only three scopes
of carbon emission

  
Scopes one and two

  
all the direct emissions
from your fleets and your factories

  
and the power that you purchase

  
In the UK

  
the advertising association has estimated

  
that the entire carbon footprint
of the UK ad industry

  
worth over  billion dollars a year

  
is just  million tonnes

  
 million tonnes

  
Now scope three

  
the third scope

  
this is a bit harder

  
This is all the indirect emissions
from how people use your products

  
or from your supply chain

  
And that’s a necessary headache
for a lot of companies

  
to start taking control over

  
But technically the X industry
barely moves the dial here either

  
That’s why I believe that the X industry
needs a new scope X

  
a way to account
for the emissions of influence

  
Now the 

  
(Applause)

  
The experts at the Purpose
Disruptors network have made a start

  
at doing just that

  
They looked at a single
advertising campaign made for Audi

  
Now this campaign won one of the big
effectiveness awards in advertising

  
And the car company
and their advertising agency claimed

  
that this single campaign
generated  billion dollars

  
of incremental revenue for Audi

  
The ad campaign sold a lot of cars

  
And if their claim is correct

  
it also generated  million tonnes
of additional carbon for Audi

  
So this is a onetofive ratio

  
between the impact
of an entire industry 

  
the entire ad industry 

  
versus one single advertising campaign

  
It is time for those of us like me

  
who work in this industry

  
to take our responsibility seriously

  
And that starts with being honest
about who pays our bills

  
The X industry is famously
murky about that

  
And so my firm in  produced
the first client disclosure report

  
It’s very simple

  
We just disclosed our revenue
by the client industries which we serve

  
I’m so pleased to say
that  other ad agencies

  
consultancies and PR companies

  
have now promised to do the same

  
(Applause)

  
But our industry is dominated
by a handful of really big consultancies

  
and advertising agencies

  
and not one of them
have yet promised to join us

  
And this really matters

  
because the X industry is hiring up
many of the most inventive

  
creative

  
knowledgeable

  
and influential minds that humanity has

  
And those are the exact
same skills that we need

  
to change the course of climate change

  
Now we need all of that X industry talent
to stop serving destruction

  
and start serving solutions

  
And if you work in the X industry

  
you’re probably beginning to feel
a little bit uncomfortable right now

  
Good

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I want you to ask yourself

  
Are you selling your talent
to the right people

  
Are you serving the causes
of climate change or the solutions to it

  
And are you using all that vaunted ability
to influence your clients

  
or just to influence their critics

  
This must be the solutions decade

  
and we’re nearly two years into our window

  
to change our systems
towards climate justice

  
towards clean energy

  
circular systems

  
sustainable and equitable lifestyles

  
This solutions decade desperately requires
really goodquality financial modeling

  
It requires a really strong
legal framework

  
great research

  
It really needs public support

  
It needs the right regulatory rules

  
And it needs creative storytelling

  
and that’s what my X industry
could deliver

  
This year I changed my job title
to “Chief Solutionist”

  
I changed it to constantly remind myself
of the job that needs doing

  
Because as an X industry leader myself

  
I can either serve
the solutions every day

  
or by default

  
I’m serving destruction

  
There is no middle ground here

  
There must be no
carefully worded rationales

  
And the X industry can no longer pretend
it can remain neutral

  
Now if we do that

  
perhaps we could become
a league of solutionists

  
and shift all of this creativity

  
inventiveness

  
knowledge and influence

  
towards fixing climate change

  
And then this invisible

  
and intangible

  
and incredibly influential X industry

  
can finally stop being part of the problem

  
and become part of the solution

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
In the mids two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog

  
Stretching  meters into the sky

  
these ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge

  
But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania

  
they first had to be dismantled
packaged and shipped piece by piece

  
over  kilometers away

  
Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent

  
was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss

  
the project's lead engineers

  
Even before construction began 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition

  
The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor

  
an even more vulnerable target

  
Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business

  
and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery

  
Worse still many engineers thought
the project was impossible

  
The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to kilometerperhour winds

  
swirling tides an endless blanket of fog

  
and the earthquakeprone 
San Andreas fault

  
But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built;

  
and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters

  
more reliable passage to the city

  
He was however a bit out of his depth

  
Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge

  
This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end

  
and extended horizontally
like a diving board

  
Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight

  
Strauss’s design used two cantilevers
linked by a structure in the middle

  
But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss

  
to pursue a different approach
the suspension bridge

  
Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end

  
a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap

  
The result is a more flexible structure

  
that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads

  
This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges

  
And in the s 
advanced steel manufacturing

  
could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope

  
for largescale construction

  
At the time the Golden Gate Bridge

  
was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted

  
and its design was only possible
due to these innovations

  
But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks

  
on the country’s east coast

  
While the recently completed Panama Canal

  
made it possible to ship these components
to California

  
reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly

  
It was relatively easy to find a stable
shallow foundation for the north tower

  
But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting

  
a tenstory building underwater

  
Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations

  
bombs were dropped on the ocean floor
creating openings for pouring concrete

  
A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents

  
and workers operated in minute shifts
between tides

  
The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans

  
to prevent getting lost

  
And at one point an earthquake rocked
the south tower

  
nearly  meters in each direction

  
Strauss took worker safety very seriously
requiring hard hats at all times

  
and stretching a safety net 
below the towers

  
But not even these precautions 
could prevent

  
an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 

  
carrying ten workers to their deaths

  
Once the towers were complete 
workers spun the cables in place

  
hung suspenders at foot intervals
and laid down the concrete roadway

  
The bridge was finished
but there was still one more task ahead

  
painting it

  
After production the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer

  
it maintained throughout construction

  
But the Navy had been pushing hard

  
to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow

  
Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself

  
paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone

  
Citing numerous letters from locals

  
Morrow’s page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange”

  
beat out the Navy’s plans

  
And today this iconic color 
still complements

  
the strait’s blue water green hills 
and rolling fog

  
When we look at poor
smallholder farmers across the world

  
and particularly in my country India

  
we often think that what they need
is access to better tools

  
education government support
markets and so on

  
Yes they need all that

  
But what they really need
is a reliable and regular income

  
to live with dignity

  
A dependable income

  
even if it is as small
as  dollars a month

  
is essential for them
to stay out of poverty

  
Today their incomes
are in and out of poverty

  
which is extremely painful

  
Growing up in South India

  
I could not overlook
what poverty did to our farmers

  
I was about  years old when one day

  
I saw a farmer in my village
sitting next to a farm stream

  
and eating something from the ground

  
Something did not seem right

  
I walked up to him
to see what was going on

  
I was shocked to see him eat mud

  
Mud

  
Brown soft mud from the stream

  
I was afraid he might die

  
I yelled at him

  
"What is this stupid mudeating business"

  
He looked at me helplessly and said

  
"I'm a farmer my crops failed;

  
my stomach doesn't know
that my pocket is empty"

  
I walked away quite helplessly

  
That night I shared this
with my grandfather

  
He was a remarkable man very clever

  
He was a part of the Indian
freedom struggle

  
under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi

  
Unlike me he wasn't surprised at all

  
He knew of people
who added rice starch to mud

  
to calm their hunger

  
And he told me something profound

  
If you see a person walking
on the road without footwear

  
it is important to understand
the root cause

  
that the person doesn't have enough money
to probably buy the footwear

  
I finished my college

  
started working with a big company

  
but that incident kept coming back to me

  
Why are smallholder farmers
in such abject poverty

  
What causes them to be so desperate

  
and why is it that
even in stcentury India

  
one farmer dies by suicide
every  minutes

  
My cofounders and I spent about six months
traveling across India

  
meeting hundreds of farmers
to listen to them

  
It became clear that climate risk
is the root cause

  
that causes farming to be
unpredictable and unviable

  
Farmers who make
reasonable money in one season

  
can fail miserably in the next

  
And farmers who could grow crops
earlier in summers

  
no longer get to grow crops in summers

  
Heat is so much more

  
The wells are drying up

  
every year there are new varieties
of pests and diseases

  
Farmers told us that this is all
because of because of God

  
I said "What"

  
"This is all because of God"

  
God is the one who caused it
God is the only one who can solve it

  
God in that context
I did not see as a sign of hope

  
I read it as a sign of helplessness

  
We heard from the farmers

  
They knew the problem

  
but they could not use
these two words "climate risk"

  
So we got together a team of engineers

  
scientists designers
from about six countries

  
to cocreate a solution with our farmers

  
which is quite unconventional

  
And the solution is “greenhouseinabox”

  
We call it "Kheyti Rakshak"

  
It’s a microgreenhouse

  
It's a beautiful greenhouse

  
which sits in a small portion
of the farmer's land

  
It's easy to build a small structure

  
covered with netting on all sides

  
which cuts off heat
prevents bugs and saves water

  
We can't cool the entire
planet in one day

  
but we definitely can create a climate
for a small portion of a farmer’s land

  
to be suitable for farming

  
From our first experiences
of growing vegetables 

  
staple vegetables like tomatoes
cabbage cucumbers 

  
we observed that greenhouses
can increase yields up to seven times

  
and use  percent less water

  
All this was too good to be true

  
All these things
are so difficult to happen

  
so farmers couldn't believe it
unless they actually saw it in action

  
So to make this happen

  
we had to have the courage
to reimagine agriculture 

  
reimagine agriculture
for smallholder farmers

  
After all this is not to grow tomatoes
in an industrial setting in Alaska

  
in winters

  
It is to grow tomatoes
for a smallholder farmer

  
by a smallholder farmer
in sizzling hot Indian summers

  
So this greenhouse had to be small enough
to fit in a portion of their land

  
easy enough for them to use

  
and cheap enough for them to buy

  
One of the biggest challenges
that we could overcome in the process

  
is financing

  
Thanks to our financing partners

  
today this greenhouse
is available with financing

  
which is fast enough and cheap enough

  
The greenhouse costs about  dollars

  
Farmers pay a down payment
of about  dollars

  
and the rest is financed through a loan

  
And this lifechanging asset

  
adds and extra  dollars of profit
on average to a household

  
month on month

  
This is a good double
of what they otherwise make

  
Marginal fiveten percent increases
in the incomes of smallholder farmers

  
cannot move the needle forward much

  
because the baseline is way too low

  
We need a significant
jump in their income

  
and that income has to be
reliable and dependable

  
To ensure that farmers succeed

  
we also provide quality seeds nutrition

  
training and advisory
leveraging mobile technology

  
We rolled out the solution
after quite a few tests with farmers

  
about three years ago

  
and we are marching towards
 farmers in this year

  
and looking at  farmers
over the next five years

  
Hopefully every smallholder
farmer in my lifetime

  
(Applause)

  
The best technologies in agriculture
can reach the smallest of the farmers

  
if we do two things well

  
listen to the farmer with curiosity
empathy and compassion

  
and keep smallholder farmers
particularly women farmers

  
at the center of the design

  
and build solutions

  
Then we can cocreate
mini solutions like Kheyti Rakshak

  
which bring dignity hope and stability
to the lives of the farmers

  
In this big fight against climate change

  
we all have to remember that we should
take our smallholder farmers along;

  
it is our collective responsibility

  
India is a home for about  million
smallholder farmers

  
I dream of a day

  
when "smallholder farmer" becomes
synonymous with a happy farmer

  
and being forced to eat mud
should never be a feature again anywhere

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Yuchi F’as@^

  
English Good afternoon

  
I come from the Yuchi
and Anishinaabe nations

  
My home is in Oklahoma

  
I have been a community organizer
for Indigenous rights

  
environmental justice and climate justice

  
for more than  years

  
I don't believe that I'm old enough
to do anything for that long

  
but here I am

  
(Applause)

  
I'm an Indigenous woman who lives
in the heart of oil and gas country

  
And what that means for me
is that I am in a constant state

  
of thinking about the environment
and climate change

  
And so I want to share
a few things that I know

  
and have learned
along the way in my work

  
One is

  
we cannot rely on those
who created the problem to fix it

  
(Applause)

  
Two we need to move with an urgency
that is not happening now

  
And three

  
we need leaders
who are experiencing the harm

  
to be the ones coming up
with the solutions

  
So it is clear that world leaders
are looking for solutions

  
to this climate crisis

  
but they are looking for them
through a lens of the economy

  
And so that means they are moving
with a casualness

  
that doesn't make it seem
like there's a real emergency

  
And they’re also being sold then
solutions that are basically bandaids

  
and not actual cures to the problem

  
They're being sold techno fixes
and market schemes

  
that really maintain business as usual

  
And instead

  
we need to be thinking
about what could be different

  
So I was recently at the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change COP

  
that just happened in Glasgow Scotland
just this past month

  
And it was apparent to me

  
that those who created the agenda
are also part of the problem

  
First of all

  
they created an admittance policy
that was really a policy of exclusion

  
for many grassroots communities
across the world

  
and especially those of the global south

  
That policy also ensured

  
that the largest badge delegation at COP
were fossil fuel lobbyists

  
Can you believe that

  
Actually I can

  
because this has been sort of the norm
at COP since its beginning

  
Which is why we need a shift

  
in who are the leaders
that they're listening to

  
And the shift in leadership
are coming up with the solutions

  
We need the knowledge and expertise
of those at the frontline

  
And by frontline

  
I mean those communities and peoples
who are experiencing climate change today

  
and some who have been experiencing
the harmful effects of climate change

  
for decades now

  
Those are the frontline leaders

  
that we need to be looking to
for their expertise

  
So I want you to imagine with me

  
if at that negotiating table at COP

  
if those who were dealing
with the actual harms today

  
were in that room
and negotiating the solutions

  
What if the people who have been
living sustainable lifestyles

  
and in relationship with the land

  
had been some of those folks
in the room making those decisions

  
What would it have been like

  
if grassroots leaders had been given
significant participation

  
in those negotiations

  
What would be different

  
Well first off

  
this global climate conference
would not have led with netzero

  
as the solution to this
climate crisis we're in

  
Netzero  not actually eliminating
greenhouse gas emissions 

  
but netzero being a sort of greenwashing
of business as usual

  
It basically means that you can
wash your hands of pollution

  
in one community

  
if you can afford to participate
in a few offset programs

  
So for example

  
you can invest in the continued existence
of a forest in South America

  
of Indigenous peoples in their lands
that should capture carbon

  
What it means then you are in theory

  
obligated from the harm
that you've caused a pollution

  
at a facility in another
lowincome community 

  
and very likely community of color 
in another part of the world

  
That's just wrong

  
And it just doesn't work

  
I mean I know people real people

  
I know their names and their families
on both ends of the spectrum

  
of the netzero spectrum

  
I know people who live at the fence line
of harmful oil refineries

  
who are polluting their communities

  
and I know the Indigenous people
who are farming the forests in Brazil

  
And neither of those communities
are benefiting from these programs

  
in ways that are building empowerment
for their communities

  
and building sustainability
for their communities

  
and they're often pressured
into these programs

  
with little or no choice

  
So I want to try to explain
netzero a little bit differently

  
in a way that might be
a little more tangible

  
If you think about it as kind of
like the net part of your paycheck

  
You get a job you negotiate a pay

  
and you feel really excited about that

  
But on that first day that first payday

  
you feel the crunch of it's a lot less
than you thought it was going to be

  
And it's the same with the netzero
emission targets right

  
It sounds good on the front end

  
but when it all comes out in the wash

  
it's much less than what
we need to have happen

  
to impact real significant
change right now

  
So what we need is a shift in leadership

  
We need leaders who are moving
with the urgency

  
that people are feeling harm
and hurt today

  
And we need leaders who are moving
with the values about community

  
and about the land
and the relationship with land

  
Those are the kind of leaders that we need
to have leading with the solutions

  
and the negotiations of addressing
this problem on a worldwide level

  
So that kind of leadership

  
if we just shifted those two things
about urgency and values

  
that would help all of us worldwide

  
Because what we need
is a set of leadership

  
that is going to do the work
that we need to have done

  
which is to move away from dirty
extractive harmful energy

  
to solutions that are local
communitybased communityheld

  
regenerative energy models

  
And they exist

  
They exist in communities
where people are saying

  
"Hey if the government
is not going to help us

  
we’re going to do
what we need to do right now”

  
And they are doing these projects
in their communities

  
So instead of investing
in a carbon capture project

  
that aims to put carbon
pollution into the ground

  
a technology that's not been
proven to really work

  
and still puts communities at harm

  
because it relies on the continued
existence and construction

  
of harmful pipelines that are dangerous

  
prone to leaks and even
explosions sometimes

  
And so 

  
But these community projects
are happening and they're having success

  
and I want to share a few with you

  
So in Richmond California 

  
between two cities

  
and next to a major Chevron oil refinery

  
that is spewing out greenhouse gases

  
and other toxic chemicals
into the neighborhood 

  
community leaders worked
with community organizations

  
like Asian Pacific Environmental Network

  
Rich City Rides Urban Tilth

  
and Communities for a Better Environment

  
And they took on Chevron
to hold them accountable and won

  
And won resources to build
a solar farm in their community

  
They also built a bike coop

  
to encourage young people
and others to bike in the city

  
and built community gardens

  
to grow healthy organic food
for themselves and schools

  
(Applause)

  
In rural Kentucky a community

  
a rural community who has long relied
on coal to fuel their community

  
they've been organizing with Kentuckians
for the Commonwealth

  
and also created a solar project

  
that is helping lowincome families
reduce their utility costs

  
and created thousands of jobs

  
In the Four Corners area of Arizona
Native Renewables

  
a womanled Navajo Hopi organization

  
is providing electricity
from solar to offgrid homes

  
A community that has long been harmed

  
by the devastating effects
of fossil fuel extraction

  
is now able to rely on an energy source
that is clean and Indigenousled

  
(Applause)

  
After hurricane Maria devastated
the islands of Puerto Rico

  
Organización Boricuá worked
with local farmers

  
to provide direct and immediate
support to those communities

  
by providing water shelter

  
health food

  
the weekly agro ecological
brigades and solidarity brigades

  
and they rebuilt homes
and rebuilt farming infrastructure

  
to make sure that they maintained
food sovereignty

  
In Brooklyn New York

  
in a highly industrial
neighborhood of Sunset Park

  
the community organization UPROSE

  
helped lead an effort
to create a solar farm

  
a first community solar coop
in the state of New York

  
It is an  square foot
rooftop solar garden

  
that again is providing
affordable energy to the neighborhood

  
and to small businesses as well

  
The fight against the Line  pipeline
in Minnesota and other states

  
has highlighted the amount of water
that those types of projects have used

  
And it's caused a threat
to the natural wild rice

  
that grows in the lakes there

  
And so community people
have worked to hold state

  
and federal agencies accountable
for water standards

  
in order to protect
their cultural preservation

  
and the wild rice

  
And in New Jersey
Ironbound Community Corporation

  
along with the New Jersey
Environmental Justice Alliance

  
has helped push legislation

  
that has enabled the state
to deny permits

  
any new permits to already
overburdened overpolluted neighborhoods

  
And it's set a standard
for other states to use

  
which has become a historic environmental
justice legislation for the country

  
These are the kinds of solutions
that we need to see happen

  
These are the kind of leadership
that we need to see happen

  
and we need these solutions happening
by the thousands nationwide

  
and even globally

  
Because these solutions
are not only attacking

  
the emissions at their source

  
but they're doing it by providing jobs

  
and wages and policies

  
that are addressing racism
and colonialism and economic inequity

  
This is the kind of leadership we need

  
We need this dramatic
shift to help us all

  
This dramatic shift in leadership

  
Just these two things

  
The urgency in which we move

  
and the values on which we move with

  
My grandmothers taught me
that we need to have care

  
responsibility and action
when it comes to our community

  
And those are the kind of leaders
that we need leading this fight

  
And if we are going to be serious
about addressing this climate crisis

  
here are the steps
that I need people to do

  
I need you to bring frontline leaders
into those negotiating spaces

  
Bring them in

  
Ask them what's happening
and the harms that are happening

  
Ask them what needs to be done

  
And listen hear them

  
And then invest and implement
in exactly what they said

  
in the exact ways they said to do it

  
because those changes are the changes

  
that are going to stop the problems
that we're having

  
and then stop the acceleration
of the climate crisis

  
And it's going to help slow down
the violence of the storms

  
and the sicknesses
that people are dealing with

  
with conditions like asthma and others

  
And it's going to stop you know

  
the continued drought and wildfires

  
Those are the solutions
that we need to have happen

  
And I need you all to help carry

  
not only the ask to shift that
for our communities

  
but also those values

  
So I ask you I invite you
to join me in this

  
and I challenge you to go out

  
and challenge our elected
leaders and others

  
And if they're not doing the right job

  
then tell them who the leaders are
that need to be there

  
We need frontline leaders
to be in the spaces

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Have you ever trodden
on a Lego brick in your bare feet

  
You’re tiptoeing through
your lounge late at night

  
and suddenly that stabbing pain

  
the expletives

  
and the inevitable question

  
“Why do we have so much of this stuff
all over the place”

  
Well that’s really quite simple

  
Your kids love playing with it

  
so you buy more

  
And a confession 

  
I love to watch my kids play with Lego

  
Especially good is when
I see them inventing their own rules

  
and their own worlds

  
So here are my daughters

  
last Saturday

  
making something out of different kits

  
and pieces of string

  
and pieces of wood and dolls
and other objects

  
And I asked them “What is it”

  
And they said to me “Dad of course
it’s a princess flying on a dragon

  
to visit farm animals in New York”

  
Of course what else could it be

  
Kids at play inspire me

  
They’re not afraid to ask “What if”

  
and “Why not”

  
But what kids implicitly know
that adults tend to forget

  
is that play isn’t just about fun

  
Now as a biologist I know that play
is spontaneous and pleasurable 

  
as you can see by the smiles
in this photograph 

  
but also it accelerates
and derisks learning

  
It helps kids to try out new behaviors

  
to refine those behaviors

  
and to imagine what is not

  
but what could be or what will be

  
As a business strategist
dealing with adults

  
I still recommend play

  
In fact play in business
is not just possible

  
I’d argue that it’s essential

  
and even urgent

  
And here’s why

  
Competitive advantage fades away
faster than any time in recent memory

  
In the s

  
if you had a performance edge
over your competitors

  
you could reasonably expect to continue
being a leader for around  years

  
on average

  
But now the halflife of that advantage
has shrunk to just one year

  
That means that shortlived success
is actually still very common

  
but sustained success  becomes very hard

  
and very rare

  
That means that actually reimagination
is the new execution

  
In order to stay on top

  
or even just to tread water
and stay still

  
you need to constantly
reimagine your business

  
But that’s not so simple

  
if you already have
a highly successful business model

  
We become prisoners of the mental models
that underpin our past success

  
In fact I found
in dealing with businesses

  
that you can’t really
stretch your strategy

  
unless you stretch your mind

  
Now play is of course a great way
of stretching your mind

  
Now 

  
I mean there’d be no mistake

  
I’m not suggesting literally

  
that executives huddle around
a conference table

  
with a big pile of Lego bricks 

  
although I’ve done that
and that works too

  
But instead I’ve created a series
of imagination games

  
to help executives
to stretch their thinking

  
Would you like to play with me

  
(Audience nods)

  
Good I'm glad you said that

  
OK so let’s supposing
that you’re stuck in the rut

  
of seeing the world through the lens
of your past and current success

  
I would recommend the “AntiCompany Game”

  
and here’s how it works

  
You get a piece of paper

  
you create a list of everything
which is essential to your strategy 

  
everything which underpinned
your past success

  
everything which is core and sacred 

  
and then you flip it

  
You create the exact
mirrorimage list of assumptions

  
and then you make the best
business case for this antiself

  
You’ll be surprised
at the ideas that it triggers

  
Supposing for example
that you’re the CEO of a hotel chain

  
and playing the game
and flipping the assumptions

  
Let’s assume that inconveniently

  
you don’t actually own any hotels

  
or any rooms

  
or even operate any hotels
or any rooms anywhere

  
Ridiculous 

  
quite possibly 

  
but actually how would you know
the difference between ridiculous

  
and the merely unfamiliar
untried and uncomfortable

  
And who’s to say

  
that something that seems impractical
can’t actually become and evolve

  
into a more powerful idea

  
Actually had the executives of hotels
played the “AntiCompany Game”

  
before 

  
they might have been able to foresee
the appearance of Airbnb

  
the hotelless hospitality company

  
and they might have been able
to stave off disruption

  
by preemptively disrupting themselves

  
Let’s play another game

  
“The Maverick Game”

  
On the edge of your industries 

  
on the edge of every industry 

  
are a population of maverick companies

  
that are taking a bet against
the incumbents’ business model

  
and their view of the future

  
Actually they have no choice

  
because to be a miniature version
of the incumbent would not be viable

  
Now it’s easy not to notice them 

  
many of them are small companies

  
It's easy to deliberately overlook
them with some justification

  
Many startups disappear fairly quickly
after being founded

  
And it’s very very tempting

  
given all of your experience
in the business

  
to judge them

  
Do they know what they’re doing

  
Does their business model make sense

  
Will they ever make any money

  
But instead of judging them
from the comfort

  
and the confidence of your position

  
try assuming that it’s they that have
the right bet on the future

  
Think about the consequences
of that for your business model

  
Try making the best case for their idea

  
Supposing for example

  
that you are the CEO of a company

  
that makes equipment
that makes semiconductors

  
Naturally you’d probably spend
most of your time and attention

  
on your main customer industry

  
the electronics industry

  
And if it so happened

  
that a couple of maverick
bioscience companies

  
were tinkering with your patents
and your technologies

  
you might overlook that
as a distraction

  
an irrelevance

  
But actually Brooks Automation

  
a leader in the field

  
decided to take a closeup look
at such a group of mavericks

  
to see whether it could learn anything

  
And what it realized

  
by looking at the world
through the eyes of these mavericks

  
was that actually the same techniques

  
and technologies which can be used
to handle delicate semiconductors

  
can also be applied to other fragile
and easily contaminated materials

  
like biological samples

  
And puzzling on the significance of this

  
they reimagined how to handle
and store and transport

  
and label and identify biological samples

  
In fact they became a successful pioneer

  
in the new industry
of automated biobanking

  
So successful in fact
that just a couple of days ago

  
they announced that this was now
their core business moving forwards

  
It’s only by focusing
on these anomalous mavericks

  
that they could see their own path
to renewed success and growth

  
Now not everything in business
goes according to plan

  
In fact sometimes the plans
go horribly awry

  
But you know what

  
That can be a source of inspiration too

  
To find out how

  
let’s play the “PreMortem Game”

  
So your role in this game is to write 

  
the obituary for your company

  
which is going to fail
with  percent certainty

  
in five years’ time

  
What is the cause of death

  
What will have been the point of failure

  
Why will it have failed

  
How will it have failed

  
The challenge here is that it’s easy
to be seduced into the baseline fallacy

  
The baseline fallacy is the idea

  
that it’s the current business model
which is the lowrisk bet

  
And of course that tends to be true

  
until it isn’t true

  
at which point it’s probably too late
to do anything about it

  
Now your employees
are an earlywarning indicator

  
They will have intuitions
if the model begins to slip

  
but it’s very hard for them to speak up

  
And it’s even taboo for them to speak up

  
when the business model is under pressure

  
But when executives create playgrounds 

  
spaces for the safe exploration
of alternatives

  
and alternative scenarios 

  
then you get to tap into your employees’
considerable experience

  
about the vulnerabilities

  
and the weak spots

  
and the blind spots of your company

  
Does anyone remember visiting recently
one of these gorgeous marble palaces

  
No

  
It’s probably been a while since
we visited the local banking branch

  
Had bricksandmortar banks
played the “PreMortem Game”

  
perhaps they would have heard
their employees expressing some concerns

  
about the gradually dwindling
flow of customers to local branches

  
And perhaps they would have been
slightly less taken by surprise

  
when companies like NewBank

  
a digital native

  
seized very rapidly indeed
on that opportunity

  
to convince to date
more than  million Latin Americans

  
that inperson transactions
in real buildings

  
were a quaint but obsolete
relic of the past

  
It’s only when you bring
your vulnerabilities into full view

  
in this way

  
that you may be motivated
to reimagine your business

  
and to do so in a robust manner

  
It’s why the Roman Catholic Church
invented the role

  
the position of the Devil’s advocate
in the th century

  
to test the future consequences
of its decisions to appoint new saints

  
They did that by imagining

  
what would Satan say

  
or propose

  
or counterpropose

  
in addition to the normal procedure
of thinking about the big man upstairs

  
Now any human being
any employee any team

  
and therefore any company
can harness human imagination

  
It’s a defining trait of our species

  
Failures to imagine in business
are really failures of leadership

  
Business is a serious matter
but it should not exclude play

  
When leaders embrace play
and imagination games

  
they can unlock the imagination
of their employees

  
uncover disruptive new strategies

  
and renew their lease on the future

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Imagine a world in which China
was an environmental leader

  
That would be a more
hopeful world wouldn't it

  
When we hear about China

  
we usually hear about human rights
trade disputes toxic pollution

  
And I'm not here to dispute the news

  
Instead what I want to do

  
is share with you evidence
based on personal experience

  
of where China is leading

  
ClientEarth the environmental law
organization that I set up

  
has a person office in Beijing

  
We work as trusted partners
with the Ministry of Environment

  
We train judges and we train prosecutors
in environmental prosecutions

  
Let me share with you how this all began

  
In 

  
I was invited to Brussels to meet
a group of Chinese officials

  
They said they wanted to meet CEOs
of Western environmental groups

  
because they were looking to encourage
more environmental groups in China

  
Shortly after that
I was invited to Beijing

  
by the Supreme People's Court
the highest court in the land

  
The judges were working
on regulations for a new law

  
that would allow
Chinese environmental NGOs

  
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
They were interested in my advice

  
because of my extensive
environmental litigation experience

  
in Europe and in America

  
They wanted to know they said

  
what it would take to really make
such a system work

  
I found myself
in a conference room in Beijing

  
with three justices of the Supreme Court

  
and senior officials
of the Ministry of Environment

  
and the People's Congress
which is the Chinese parliament

  
"Before we get into details" I said
"I want to compliment you

  
It is amazing that you are writing a law

  
to allow Chinese environmental groups
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
This is revolutionary"

  
(Laughter)

  
The senior judge said "Mr Thornton
'revolutionary' is a big word for us"

  
(Laughter)

  
So we laughed

  
And in that human moment
I realized I could work with these people

  
He said "Consider it a sea change"

  
So for the next three months or so

  
my team and I worked
very closely with the judges

  
designing recommendations
for how to make the system really deliver

  
for citizens enforcing the law

  
One of the key provisions
we worked on involved costs

  
Now it costs money to bring
environmental litigation

  
and what really kills you is

  
if when you lose you have to pay
the other side's costs

  
as you do in the UK

  
We said this was only going to work
for the Chinese environmental groups

  
if when they won a case

  
they had all of their costs
paid by the polluters

  
but when they lost they would not
have to pay any of the polluters’ costs

  
Because win or lose

  
they were asserting the interests
of the public at large

  
Three months after that I found myself
back in a meeting in Beijing;

  
this time in the Supreme Court building
just off Tiananmen Square

  
I was there with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
We were sitting at a white marble table
that seemed to be  feet long

  
Across from us were three
Supreme Court judges

  
A senior judge began the meeting

  
by saying that they had accepted
almost all of our recommendations

  
including the key recommendation on costs

  
So at one stroke

  
the Chinese system became friendlier
to citizen environmental groups

  
trying to enforce the law

  
than many countries

  
The senior judge then said
"What do you want to do next for China"

  
Now on my prior trip

  
I had learned that the Chinese
had just appointed

  
 environment court judges

  
Now environment judges specialists
are rare around the world

  
In Europe for example
there's just a handful in Scandinavia

  
Their idea was that by appointing
all of these specialist judges

  
they would hear a vast volume of cases

  
and raise the quality of the rule of law
for the environment in China quickly

  
"So" I said "you might want
to train those judges"

  
They then asked us to train the judges

  
But I had never trained
a judge in my life

  
So I said “Where shall we start”

  
"With us" he said

  
"With the Supreme Court"

  
"Yes"

  
"But what do you want to learn"

  
"Well" he said "we want you to come back

  
and give us a seminar
on climate litigation

  
because you're an expert in that"

  
I said "Gladly but what's the thought
behind your request"

  
And he said

  
“We want to know the best
climate change cases in the world

  
because we want to decide
some of the best climate change cases

  
here in China"

  
Now I can assure you that I had never
had such a conversation

  
with the Supreme Court in Washington 

  
(Laughter)

  
or even London or Paris

  
Certainly nowhere other than Beijing

  
So we teamed up with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
to create a ClientEarth office in Beijing

  
He then organized this training seminar
for the Supreme Court

  
where we discussed trends
in climate litigation around the world

  
He then organized training sessions

  
for all of those specialist
environment court judges

  
Now more such judges have been
appointed in the meantime

  
and as of today

  
we've trained more than 
of these judges

  
(Applause)

  
About a year after we started
training the judges

  
a prosecutor came to our office and said

  
"In that law that you helped write

  
we the prosecutors got the right to sue
the Chinese government

  
on behalf of the people
for environmental matters

  
and we've never had the right
to sue the government before"

  
ClientEarth on the other hand
sues governments all the time

  
(Laughter)

  
So they were asking us
to share with them

  
our experience of suing governments

  
This was the Chinese federal prosecutors
asking us to train them

  
to sue the Chinese government

  
(Laughter)

  
It is the most amazing request
I've ever had

  
(Laughter)

  
So of course we started
working with them

  
We've now trained over  prosecutors
in how to bring environmental cases

  
(Applause)

  
A few months ago (Laughs)

  
we got a letter handdelivered

  
from the prosecutors
to our Beijing office

  
Now what I'm told
by my friends in Beijing

  
ordinarily the last thing
in life you want to get

  
is a letter from the prosecutors

  
This however was a thankyou note

  
and what it said was "Thank you
for your cooperation with us

  
As a result of cooperating with you

  
we have brought in  alone

  
over  environmental cases"

  
Audience Whoa

  
(Applause)

  
 cases and the majority
of those cases

  
were brought against
government departments

  
Now the prosecutors have set up bureaus
all over the country

  
to keep pushing out this level of cases

  
to raise compliance standards
throughout the country

  
Now if this isn't a revolution
it's certainly a sea change

  
(Laughter)

  
Now whenever I talk about China
I'm always asked about coal

  
China burns more coal
than any other country

  
We're working on that

  
Following the money
we've been working for some years

  
with the largest banks
and financial institutions in China

  
The argument we've been making

  
is that coal is simply a bad
investment for them to make

  
Recently we had
a twoday seminar in Beijing

  
for these institutions

  
and it was very heartening to see

  
that that argument
that coal is a bad investment

  
has now been internalized
by these institutions

  
and taken into their own thinking

  
When it comes to enforcement

  
the prosecutors have a new
fantastic opportunity

  
Recently a government audit

  
found that many of the new
coalfired power stations

  
authorized in recent times in China

  
were authorized illegally
by provincial officials

  
who wanted to boost their balance sheet

  
Because these were illegally authorized

  
they are a perfect enforcement target

  
Now another major problem
is all of the coalfired power stations

  
that Chinese companies
have been planning to build

  
outside China in Belt and Road
development countries

  
So we've been working
alongside many others

  
with the Ministry of Environment

  
to try and figure out how you stop
all of those coalfired power stations

  
in the pipeline

  
And what is wonderful news
is that in September 

  
President Xi Jinping
at the UN General Assembly

  
announced that China
would not fund or build

  
any more coalfired
power stations outside China

  
(Applause)

  
We also have reason to believe 
and good reason I think 

  
that China’s own emissions
will hit their peaking plateau soon

  
and then will seriously
decline before 

  
Now does more need to be done in China

  
Certainly  a lot more and faster

  
just like in every other country

  
But what I've found heartening

  
are all of these changes to the system
that they've been making in recent years

  
All of these environment court judges

  
the tens of thousands of cases

  
many of them against
government departments;

  
the Ministry of Environment
getting enhanced powers;

  
the largest banks
and financial institutions

  
realizing that coal is a bad investment;

  
the president promising
no more coal outside China

  
We work in many countries
around the world

  
but I have never seen
the intense focus on systemic change

  
moving a country towards
environmental improvements

  
as I've seen in China

  
I'd like to think that I have
given you reasons for hope

  
China has certainly given me hope

  
Thank you

  
(Cheers and applause)

  
I’d like to dedicate this talk
to my three children

  
Phi Mack

  
and Ella Roberta

  
(Inhales)

  
If I stop breathing for two minutes

  
I would die

  
It is the simplest thing
that all of us do unconsciously

  
about  times a day

  
So normal

  
that we forget that breathing
is the essence of life

  
My daughter Ella Roberta

  
stopped breathing frequently

  
and was resuscitated
numerous times by me at home

  
and in hospital by her doctors

  
until suddenly on the th of February

  
three weeks after her ninth birthday

  
she took her final breath

  
Ella was a healthy clever
sporty and funny girl

  
She had a lot of musical ability

  
At the time of her passing

  
she already played a dozen instruments

  
She was exceptionally good at football

  
cycling skating swimming and dancing

  
Ella was a great writer

  
and she was also pretty good at art

  
At the time of her passing

  
she had a reading age of  years

  
When she was six

  
the simple act of breathing
became the biggest challenge of her life

  
I rushed Ella to hospital
 times in  months

  
when she suddenly began suffering
severe respiratory issues

  
She was diagnosed
with lifethreatening asthma

  
at the age of seven

  
She was admitted
into intensive care five times

  
and put in an induced coma
to save her life

  
when her lungs gave up on her

  
It wasn't until after
the first coroner's inquest

  
in September 

  
that I learned that her possible trigger
of her sudden illness

  
was to do with "something in the air"

  
But at that time
we did not know what it was

  
Ella had one of the worst
cases ever of asthma

  
recorded in the United Kingdom

  
according to the pathologist
who carried out her postmortem

  
We as a family we live  meters
from the South Circular

  
in southeast London

  
It is one of the busiest roads in the UK

  
I later learned that air
pollution around our home

  
was persistently far above the levels
deemed acceptable by the WHO

  
On every walk to school every bike ride

  
every time Ella went outside

  
her body was absorbing
invisible toxic air

  
spewed out by petrol and diesel vehicles

  
A second inquest into Ella’s death
just in December 

  
the coroner Philip Barlow

  
he concluded that it was the excessive
illegal levels of air pollution

  
not only inducted her asthma

  
but it was the highest ever
on the night she died

  
As a result of this

  
Ella is the first person in the world

  
to have air pollution
listed as a cause of death

  
on her death certificate

  
Ella's story is unique I admit

  
but her experience is shockingly ordinary

  
In too many countries around the world

  
air pollution exceeds

  
what the WHO tells us
is acceptable to breathe

  
Fossil fuels everyone
they're killing us

  
Almost one in five premature deaths

  
are linked to air pollution

  
from combustion engines
coal power plants

  
wood burning ammonia cooking stoves

  
and other fossil fuels

  
That is  million people a year
dying from heart attacks cancer strokes

  
dementia suicide depression
stillbirths and miscarriages

  
And that's just the start

  
Children are the worst affected
due to their lungs still developing

  
Air pollution stunts the development
of lungs and brains

  
Scientists believe it
are finding soot in mothers placentas

  
meaning unborn babies
are directly exposed to the black carbon

  
produced by motor traffic
and fuel burning

  
Like Ella  percent of children
around the world

  
are breathing unsafe air

  
The real tragedy of this is we know
how to solve this public health crisis

  
We need to shift from toxic fossil fuels

  
to clean electrified public
and active transport

  
The second inquest into Ella’s death
made it abundantly clear

  
Ella would still be here alive today

  
if air pollution around our home

  
had been within the WHO acceptable limits

  
Air pollution is an invisible
global pandemic

  
It's a silent killer

  
You know what
unless you clean up the air

  
you will never resolve climate change

  
Do you know why

  
It's linked to global warming

  
acid rain

  
effects on wildlife

  
depletion of the ozone layer

  
But for me this is personal

  
Eight years after Ella's death

  
I still visit respiratory doctors
with Ella’s siblings

  
who continue to be impacted
by excessive air pollution

  
As my children and I share a genetic link

  
we are equally susceptible
to air pollution

  
The WHO recently
strengthened its guidelines

  
and the evidence shows us
there is no such thing as safe levels

  
Every country in the world

  
must enshrine these new
WHO guidelines into law now

  
I'm putting them on notice

  
(Applause)

  
What do I want

  
I'll tell you what I want

  
I want every government
to guarantee their children

  
the chance to live full and healthy lives

  
To be able to fully and safely breathe

  
Breathing clean air
is every child's human right

  
Governments have a duty of care
to protect their citizens

  
Remember  million people
in the world have asthma

  
including me

  
(Breathing through inhaler)

  
The fight to breathe clean air is real

  
When I say "Breathe life"

  
what do you say

  
You say "Clean air is our right!"

  
Breathe life!

  
Audience Clean air is our right!

  
RAKD Thank you for listening

  
Thank you very much

  
(Applause and cheers)

Hera queen of the gods 
was on the edge of her throne

  
A mountain nymph named Echo 
renowned for her charm and chatter

  
was regaling her with a sensational story

  
But what Hera didn’t know 
was that Echo was merely distracting her

  
while her husband Zeus

  
was frolicking about 
with the other nymphs

  
Unfortunately for Echo Zeus got sloppy
and Hera realized what was going on

  
Enraged by Echo’s duplicity—

  
and powerless to stop 
her husband’s adultery—

  
Hera decided to silence
the nymph for good

  
From then on Echo could no longer
enrapture listeners with her stories;

  
she could only repeat the last words
another said

  
As her conversations became dull 
and her company undesirable

  
Echo grew dispirited

  
One day while Echo was drifting
through the woods

  
she spotted a young man hunting deer

  
It was Narcissus the stunningly beautiful
son of a river god and water nymph

  
After his birth a seer had given 
his mother a cryptic prophecy

  
Narcissus would live a long life—
but only if he never really knew himself

  
No one was sure exactly 
what to make of this

  
And in the meantime
Narcissus grew into a proud youth

  
His good looks attracted many admirers

  
But he preferred to amble through life
on his own

  
and left a trail of broken hearts 
in his wake

  
Seeing Narcissus there 
Echo was filled with longing

  
Unable to initiate a conversation
she walked after him

  
Soon Narcissus heard a rustle 
and called out

  
“Who goes there Who are you”

  
Echo revealed herself
but only repeated the word “you”

  
making her tone as endearing as possible
as she went to hold him

  
Agitated Narcissus said 
“Let me go I can’t stay”

  
Echo could only counter 
with a plea for him to do so

  
Freeing himself from her embrace
Narcissus snapped

  
“I’d rather die than have you love me!”

  
To which Echo could only cry
“Love me love me”

  
Narcissus told Echo once more 
to leave him alone

  
then faded from her gaze

  
Echo wandered to a cave

  
And gradually her heart grew heavy
and her body frail

  
until all that was left of her 
was her voice

  
which the wind carried to vast
empty places

  
Forever after it could be heard 
reverberating through hollow caves

  
and rebounding across lonely clearings

  
But this wasn’t even the first time
heartbreak over Narcissus

  
had proven fatal

  
A young man named Ameinias had also been
cruelly rejected by Narcissus

  
Before his death he prayed to Nemesis
the goddess of revenge

  
that Narcissus would also one day
know the pain of love

  
She heard Ameinias’ pleas and 
upon witnessing Echo’s fate

  
decided that it would be 
the final affront

  
It was time for retribution

  
So Nemesis set Narcissus 
towards a clear glassy pool

  
As he bent towards the water to drink

  
he caught sight
of a hauntingly beautiful young man

  
Never before had Narcissus 
seen himself with such clarity

  
He spent the day acquainting himself
with every glinting angle and glowing curl

  
then passed the evening 
gazing at his reflection by moonlight

  
and sleeping with his fingers
grazing the water

  
Days wore on and Narcissus never parted
from his one true love

  
When he reached out 
his double reached for him;

  
and when he leaned in to bestow a kiss
he also tilted his face

  
But when he tried to hold 
the bewitching figure it disappeared

  
At last Narcissus knew the agony
of unrequited love

  
Eating and drinking nothing 
Narcissus too wasted away

  
His neck ached from bending over the lake
and his legs became rooted to the grass

  
When the wood nymphs finally passed by

  
all that was left of him 
was a white and yellow flower

  
bending towards its reflection

  
From then on it was known as narcissus

  
I am a repair geek

  
I grew up fixing things with my dad;
it was what we did

  
We fixed our TV
we fixed our refrigerator

  
we fixed stuff that didn't need fixing

  
We fixed our Volkswagen Beetle

  
In our home

  
if something broke we took it
as an opportunity to have fun

  
We loved the idea and the challenge
of bringing things back to life

  
And I still love that feeling

  
which to me is just thrilling

  
I did it recently

  
My laptop was overheating

  
I thought it might be the fan

  
I ordered a fan

  
I put the fan in I turned it on

  
and the fan went "whir"

  
like “Yes! That really worked”

  
It was a great feeling

  
Now I know this kind of repair
probably sounds very oldfashioned

  
and I probably look
a little oldfashioned

  
but it's much more than saving money

  
It's how we keep the things
that we like in use

  
It helps us keep things out of the trash

  
It helps bring jobs into our communities

  
and it can help solve the digital divide

  
Now since  I've been
the executive director

  
of the Digital Right to Repair Coalition

  
otherwise known as repairorg

  
Our members do all the Rs

  
We repair we reuse
we resell and we recycle

  
And in doing this work
I've come to realize

  
that repair is right now central

  
to all of our sustainability goals

  
If we can fix our stuff a little more
frequently keep it in use

  
we're keeping it out of the front
of the waste stream at the front end

  
So we'll have less to process
at the back end

  
If we are going to have any control
over our ewaste problem

  
we have to talk about repair

  
Let me give you a sense of scale

  
Back in 

  
the EPA estimated
that the average US household

  
already owned  digitallydriven
gizmos and gadgets

  
It was everything from garagedoor openers

  
and hot tub controls to smart toasters

  
If we just do a little math and multiply

  
 times are roughly
 million households

  
we come up with a pretty staggering

  
three and a half billion pieces of ewaste

  
that don't belong in our landfills

  
and they are costly

  
and difficult to put back as raw materials

  
if those processes even exist

  
When we look a little more closely
at what's even possible with recycling

  
I think we've been ignoring
some really ugly truths

  
By the time a laptop or a refrigerator

  
or even an electric toothbrush
gets in our hands

  
almost all of the environmental
damage has already been done

  
All the costs of mining and refining
and smelting and transportation

  
And we don't see these costs
when we go to the store

  
and we don't see the human costs
of terrible labor conditions

  
and exposure to toxic materials

  
So even if we can't agree
on how to calculate these costs

  
I think we can agree that fixing more
and throwing away less just makes sense

  
There's a lot of other advantages
of repairing things

  
other than just the obvious

  
Repair is what lets us keep
our older devices in use

  
and it allows a secondary market
for the products that we want to resell

  
And secondary markets
are why used equipment is so affordable

  
because the used seller
has to compete with new

  
So if a new gadget is  dollars

  
we expect a pretty big discount
to buy that same item used

  
Let's start with  percent

  
So now we have an affordability capability

  
that is central to crossing
the digital divide

  
We had five million students
that went to virtual school this past year

  
that didn't have enabling technology

  
And that's because parents
and school districts couldn't buy new

  
We still have a lot of chip shortages

  
and these are going to be
with us for a while

  
And I think we have to think very
seriously about doing more repair

  
not just to make things last longer

  
but also to be more resilient
as an economy

  
Repair is also a point of entry
for a lot of our engineers and innovators

  
I heard Steve Wozniak
speak very recently 

  
Apple Steve Wozniak 

  
He spoke very recently
about his growth and development

  
at a time when he was repairing
things as a kid

  
And it was central
to his development as an engineer

  
He grew up pretty much
the same time I did

  
where repairs were very ordinary

  
Consumers were empowered to take
their vacuum tubes to the local store

  
plug them in and see if they work

  
and then buy a replacement on the spot

  
And there were lots of options for repair
within the community

  
to help with the more
difficult challenges

  
I think you've probably noticed

  
that these mom and pop
businesses disappeared

  
or all but disappeared in our communities

  
And it’s not because we don’t want
to fix our stuff

  
it's because they were not allowed to buy
the essential repair materials

  
that enabled them to stay in business

  
So if we can back that back

  
and make it possible
for our local repair shops

  
to buy parts and tools

  
then those businesses will come back

  
and they will bring back with them
jobs that feed families

  
And our nerdy kids will be
able to open things up

  
figure out how they work

  
and become the engineers
and innovators of our future

  
Repair jobs which I mentioned

  
they’re great jobs

  
and they don't require an advanced degree

  
I'll give you an example

  
There's a charity
in Minnesota called Tech Dump

  
and they take in donated electronics

  
and then they hire adults
that are hard to employ

  
many of whom coming out
of the criminal justice system

  
They train them to make repairs

  
They then take the repaired goods

  
sell them and use the proceeds
to fund more training

  
They’re keeping equipment
out of the waste stream;

  
they’re bringing goodquality equipment
to their community in a used format;

  
and they are bringing people out
of poverty and into the workforce

  
What's really got me irritated

  
(Laughs)

  
is that at this point

  
the vast majority of products
on the market today

  
cannot be repaired by any party

  
without being totally dependent
on the manufacturer

  
And the day the manufacturer decides
they don't want you to fix it

  
it's over

  
This is a completely artificial problem

  
Manufacturers used to provide
comprehensive documentation

  
and schematics and shipped
it with every product

  
It was expected
that you could fix your stuff

  
Then once the internet allowed
this documentation to be hosted online

  
manufacturers stopped printing

  
which made sense
because printing was expensive

  
And then somewhere
along the line somebody said

  
"Ah we need to know
who's using our website"

  
So they demanded a login

  
And then another bright light said

  
"Oh we can charge"

  
So they put up a paywall

  
And then a third bright light said

  
"We can't let anybody
have this information at all

  
They might compete with us"

  
And that's where we are today

  
We can't get what we need
to fix our stuff

  
Now I can tell you
because I've had a frontrow seat

  
this trend towards a throwaway economy
is reversing all over the world

  
And it's really fun to be able
to tell you about it

  
Back in 

  
we put forward our very first
digital “Right to Repair” bill

  
and that became the template
for dozens of other bills

  
And this year we've had  states
take up the same legislation

  
These bills are starting to pass

  
There's been a lot of help
from the Federal Trade Commission

  
and also the Biden administration

  
in saying we really as a country

  
need to be able to fix our stuff
and we need competition for repair

  
It's not just us

  
Canada and Australia
have got similar processes underway

  
The European Union has put forward
a set of regulations that just took effect

  
that are limiting the use of adhesives
in the construction of products

  
because if you can't get into the thing

  
you can't fix the thing

  
France has yet another idea

  
They are requiring manufacturers to rate
themselves on their repairability

  
and then they are posting those scores
for consumers to consider prepurchase

  
There are groups forming up
all over the world

  
that help people repair stuff

  
even without government
or regulatory change

  
You may have seen Repair Cafés
advertised in your community

  
That first Repair Café
started in  in Denmark

  
There are now over 
official chapters

  
There are web sites YouTube

  
and a company called ifixitcom

  
that hosts tens of thousands
of repair tutorials

  
to help people learn
how to fix their stuff

  
Last year

  
they recorded  million
unique users on their website

  
so I think it's pretty clear
people do want to fix their stuff

  
So I'm very encouraged by the fact
that our throwaway economy

  
the trend is reversing

  
And we are going to be able
to fix our stuff

  
We're going to be able
to use the things we want

  
in the way that we want them

  
We will be able to cross
the digital divide

  
and we will have more jobs

  
and we will all get that great
“Yes! I fixed it!” feeling

  
So the next time
something around you breaks

  
don't take "broken" for an answer

  
Go fix something

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
When I was  years old

  
we traveled from Colorado
to New Jersey to visit relatives

  
at Christmas time

  
We did a host of a variety of things

  
I actually got to see
the original cast in "The Wiz"

  
and did a lot of sightseeing

  
But one of my favorite moments
was to stay up late at night

  
and wait till everyone else
had gone to bed

  
and then I would sneak downstairs
to watch television

  
A host of old movies
that I probably had no business watching

  
such as "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Oklahoma"

  
that was a little OK

  
But I remember one evening
coming across a show

  
It was an old movie

  
and it must have been "White Christmas"

  
or “Holiday Inn” or that type

  
But it was a musical

  
And I started watching

  
and then they started
to do this musical scene

  
and I noticed I saw
Bing Crosby in blackface

  
And I was confused

  
I couldn't quite understand

  
what the blackface had to do
with the singing and dancing

  
That was my introduction
to blackface minstrelsy

  
Blackface minstrelsy originated
in New York and not the South

  
as a lot of people would think

  
in the s

  
It was an incident where white actors
would blacken their faces with burnt cork

  
paint on bright red lips

  
exaggerate the whites of their eyes

  
and put on a tightly coiled wig

  
to create caricatures of African Americans
on the American stage

  
The typical minstrel show
was a parody of Black culture

  
song and dance and speech

  
interspersed with stump speeches jokes

  
musical interludes and theatrical skits

  
The cast included a roster
of recurring characters

  
The interlocutor acted as the emcee

  
You had Mr Tambo
and Mr Bones as the end men

  
Then you also had characters
like the clownish slave Jim Crow

  
which was also the name
of the Jim Crow laws

  
that we knew in the American South

  
Or the maternal mammy
a hypersexualized wench;

  
an arrogant dandy Zip Coon;
and the lazy childish Sambo

  
The caricatures were often brutal

  
but not to the white audiences

  
who laughed at the antics
of the illiterate slaves

  
as they sat secure
in their own superiority

  
The image of the dancing
simpleminded buffoons

  
captured the public's imagination

  
and spread across the country
like wildfire

  
Blackface minstrelsy grew

  
to be the most popular form of American
entertainment in the th century

  
Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain spoke
highly of the American minstrel show

  
applauding the characterizations
and the source of its humor

  
But just as it entertained

  
it also dehumanized
the subjects of its ridicule

  
leaving the abolitionist
Frederick Douglass

  
to describe blackface minstrels as

  
“the filthy scum of white society

  
who have stolen from us a complexion
denied them by nature"

  
Ironically after the Civil War

  
African Americans forged their own careers
on the professional stage

  
The route to success often meant
appropriating the mask

  
that was used to mock them

  
White audiences also embraced
Black performance

  
in their local communities

  
These amateur minstrels
used instructional guides

  
that provided them with jokes routines

  
songs and costumes they needed
to put on their own shows

  
Such was the habit of politicians
fraternal orders colleges

  
high schools and community performances

  
who carried on this tradition
well into the th century

  
The professional minstrel show
left an indelible imprint

  
on the American psyche

  
The images and racial stereotypes

  
that continue to circulate
in American society

  
on sheet music magazines books

  
vaudeville theater film television

  
radio records

  
and all kinds of formats

  
These stereotypes
were a powerful reinforcement

  
of the ideas of white supremacy
and Black inferiority

  
The news headlines of the last few months

  
have shown us that the legacy
of blackface minstrelsy

  
continues to haunt us

  
In a survey conducted
by the Pew Research Center

  
they found that one in three Americans
say that blackface is always

  
or sometimes OK

  
if it's used in a Halloween costume

  
So let me ask this question

  
What is the appeal of darkening one's skin

  
in order to impersonate someone
of a different race

  
Blackface minstrelsy was born
out of the realities of slavery

  
and racial segregation

  
and its continual reappearance
echoes the pain and suffering

  
felt by Black people

  
whose bodies and cultures
were presented as strange and grotesque

  
It is a persistent reminder of the racism

  
and prejudices that bred
its very existence

  
The way it infiltrated society
is a clear example

  
of how deeply ingrained
racism is in this country

  
And the racial subjugation embodied
by blackface minstrelsy 

  
and perpetuated through a continuum
of its history  is a form of aggression

  
a psychic wound that refuses to heal

  
Racial impersonation of any form
cannot escape this legacy

  
So it's time to shift
the power of representation

  
to develop more expansive narratives

  
about the rich complexity
of who we are as human beings

  
Acknowledging and recognizing
blackface for what it is

  
and what it symbolizes

  
is a step in the right direction

  
Educating ourselves on how stereotypes
reinforce racist ideologies is another

  
Success in either case depends
on an honest self assessment

  
of our social and cultural biases
and how they came to be

  
The legacy of blackface minstrelsy
is our shared history

  
and requires all of us
to take collective responsibility

  
in dismantling its power
to oppress and humiliate

  
The next time you're confronted
with someone in blackface

  
or see a racist stereotype

  
tell me What will you do

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
So having a sex problem
is like having a toothache

  
By the time you get to the dentist
or to me a sex therapist

  
you just want to get out of pain

  
But what we just went through with COVID
that was like a sexual root canal

  
I mean we spent months
not changing out of our pajamas

  
And sometimes not showering

  
No wonder so many of us lost our libidos

  
It's not that we're not sexual people

  
We want to want sex

  
We just don't want it

  
In my work with couples

  
one of the biggest problems I see

  
is that sex often stalls out
before it even gets started

  
There’s a “failure to launch”

  
an inability to get going
and gain momentum

  
For example one of my patients shuts down

  
as soon as her partner starts to kiss her

  
Turns out her boyfriend
in the eighth grade

  
told her she had bad breath

  
Another patient of mine
is terrified of losing his erection

  
so much so that he avoids any situation
that could possibly lead to sex

  
But he tells his partner he has no desire

  
and he blames it on work stress

  
Meanwhile he's filled with longing

  
He just doesn't dare show it

  
And so his partner
feels confused and unattractive

  
For some of us there just
isn't room in our busy lives

  
for sexual energy to emerge

  
There isn’t what I call the “erotic
thread” between sexual events

  
those moments when
we can express desire or feel desire

  
pivot in and out of a quick sexual charge
just for the heck of it

  
So you know it's no surprise

  
that by the time we actually
do get around to finally having sex

  
too often it can feel reduced

  
to a mundane series
of predictable behaviors

  
stale and drained of erotic life

  
So why even bother

  
Whenever the issue is a failure to launch

  
what we really need is a new way in

  
what I call an arousal runway

  
And I firmly believe that that runway

  
needs to be in the form
of psychological arousal

  
not just physical

  
For example we know that some women
can fantasize their way to orgasm

  
without ever touching themselves

  
And men  well men
can just look at something sexy

  
or think about something sexy

  
and start to get
a strong physical reaction

  
That's the power of psychological arousal

  
So why aren't we sharing
more of it with each other

  
Well in the beginning of a relationship
we really don't need to

  
The newness itself is often
its own form of psychological stimuli

  
But as we go on

  
and as our sexual connection
starts to lose its vitality

  
that's when we need to be more deliberate
about engaging our erotic minds together

  
Otherwise we might start to drift apart

  
We might start to fall
into a sexless relationship

  
Some of us might even start to cheat

  
which is the only way that many of us know
to get back on that arousal runway

  
I have rarely met a couple

  
that doesn't understand
the importance of psychological arousal

  
and doesn't want
more of it in the bedroom

  
but they often just
don't know where to begin

  
So I give homework assignments

  
that emphasize two types
of psychological arousal

  
face to face and side by side

  
Face to face is things
like sharing a fantasy

  
roleplaying a sexy scenario

  
engaging in sexual roleplay

  
Activities that two people can do
just between themselves

  
with only their imaginations

  
Well that's easier said than done

  
With so much shame
and inhibition around sex

  
that takes willingness

  
it takes vulnerability
and it takes courage

  
So I often suggest starting out
with a side by side experience

  
something that's a little less pressured

  
Reading some literary erotica
aloud together

  
listening to a sexy podcast
watching ethical porn

  
That's the kind where the performers
actually want to be there

  
Recently I was working
with a heterosexual couple

  
that needed an arousal boost

  
They were trying to get back into sex
after having a baby

  
And she especially needed help
tuning out the stressors

  
and getting into a sexual mindset

  
But as a breastfeeding mom
she felt totally touched out

  
So she loved the idea
of psychological arousal

  
She thought it would be a blast
to watch porn together

  
She never did anything
like that in her life

  
But for him that was
something private and off limits

  
and he was worried that she was going
to judge him based on his tastes

  
So I came up with a solution

  
I gave them a list of ethical porn sites

  
and I asked them "Hey how do you feel

  
about each picking a scene or two
that you think would turn on the other"

  
Well not only was he willing to do that

  
it led to a fascinating and funny
followup conversation

  
He asked her "Why exactly
did you pick tickle torture for me"

  
(Laughter)

  
So starting side by side

  
it helps us get face to face

  
But then that face to face arousal

  
it needs to be more
than just putting on sexy lingerie

  
or buying handcuffs and a blindfold

  
On their own those things
are pretty inert

  
What makes them arousing is when they
enable us to tap into our fantasies

  
or what the late great sex therapist
Jack Morin called a “core erotic theme”

  
Sexual scenarios that uniquely
turn us on more than others

  
and they hold on
to that erotic charge over time

  
Well a lot of couples say
they don't have fantasies

  
or they don't know
what their fantasies are

  
But once you start having
those side by side experiences

  
those erotic themes start to emerge
and get talked about

  
Like the couple with the new baby

  
Why did she end up
picking tickle torture for him

  
Well she felt like
he needed to lose control

  
both in and out of the bedroom

  
and he was very ticklish

  
Because she was the one who actually
had to go through the pain of childbirth

  
but then he made such a big deal
about being in the delivery room

  
and having to watch and how hard it was

  
he needed to be punished for that

  
(Laughter)

  
And because she loved the idea of just
stepping out of her nurturing mom role

  
and for a little while
being a powerful dominatrix

  
I can't say they ever got as far
as actually engaging in tickle torture

  
but I do know that they started to move
from side by side to face to face

  
and started to play with power
in ways that they both found really hot

  
So what if you are someone
who fantasizes during sex

  
but you keep it to yourself

  
Does that count a psychological arousal

  
And what if the person
you're fantasizing about

  
isn't the person
you're actually having sex with

  
That can be confusing

  
You might start to wonder
"What's going on here Am I bored

  
Am I not into the sex
Am I cheating in my mind

  
Should I push those thoughts
out of my head"

  
No

  
Our fantasies are our allies

  
They help distract us away

  
from the chaotic world
outside of our bedroom

  
and they lead us and they lull us
into our sexual bodies

  
so that we can tune in and turn on

  
Our fantasies are our friends

  
You don't fear them You follow them

  
Now does that mean you should
take your partner with you

  
and tell them about that secret fantasy

  
Well that depends

  
It could be a great way of going deeper
into that facetoface arousal

  
But on the other hand

  
if you and your partner
are just starting to dip your toes

  
into the shallow end of the fantasy pool

  
well then you might want to hang out

  
in the intermediate section
a little bit you know

  
like splash around a little bit
get comfortable

  
develop some emotional safety

  
establish boundaries

  
I mean maybe you got
to make it clear to your partner

  
"Hey just so we know fantasy is fantasy
because it's not reality right"

  
There's a line between thought and action

  
And just because you happen to have
erotic themes that turn you on

  
and that include others

  
that doesn't mean that the sex
isn't still just about the two of you

  
A bunch of years ago

  
I did a study with Dr Kristen Mark
on the topic of sexual boredom

  
We surveyed nearly  people
in committed relationships

  
and found that more than  percent were
either bored or on the brink of boredom

  
Women were twice as likely to be bored
in the first year of a relationship

  
and men got bored
in the first three years

  
That's a whole lot of boredom
on both sides of the bed

  
But the good news

  
the vast majority of respondents
were entirely interested

  
in trying something new
that their partners suggested

  
So the antidote to boredom
it could just be a sexy suggestion away

  
It could be as simple
as waking up one morning

  
looking at your partner and just saying

  
"Hey I just had
the hottest dream about you"

  
And then you fill in the blanks

  
If it makes you blush
just blame it on your subconscious

  
The point is that sexy suggestion

  
that little nugget
of psychological arousal

  
that could be the difference
between lying in bed next to someone

  
and feeling a million miles apart

  
or getting on that arousal runway
together and taking off

  
So what do you think

  
After a year and a half of being grounded

  
Isn't it time to spread our sexual wings
and let ourselves fly

  
Thank you

  
On April  
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin

  
piloted a  kilogram spacecraft 
in humanity’s first manned space flight

  
One week later Bell Aerosystems debuted
another advancement in aviation

  
the gaspowered rocket pack

  
Capable of flying  meters 
in just  seconds

  
the rocket pack thrilled onlookers

  
But the device’s engineers
were less enthused

  
Despite years of cuttingedge work

  
they knew this short flight was all
the rocket pack could muster

  
So why was a massive spacecraft easier
to send flying than a single pilot

  
According to Newton's laws of motion

  
the physics behind flight are
actually quite simple

  
All you need is a powerful enough
upward force

  
to counteract the downward force 
of gravity

  
And since objects with more mass
experience stronger gravitational forces

  
lighter objects should be easier
to get off the ground

  
However modern jet engines
our primary tool for flight

  
actually get more efficient
the larger they are

  
Jet engines work by sucking in huge
volumes of air

  
and then expelling that air
as quickly as possible

  
While most of this actually bypasses
the inner machinery

  
it still contributes to a huge portion
of the engine's thrust

  
But the air that does enter 
the engine’s core gets compressed

  
by a series of tightly packed blades

  
That compressed air then enters
the combustion chamber

  
where it is injected with jet fuel
and ignited

  
The heat causes the compressed air 
to rapidly expand

  
bursting out of the exhaust 
and propelling the engine forward

  
As air leaves the engine it also turns 
a turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle

  
This turbine powers the fan
and the compressor blades

  
creating a cycle that maintains thrust
for as long as there’s fuel to burn

  
The more air an engine can take in and 
expel the more thrust it can produce

  
On a modern jet the diameter 
of a frontal fan is larger than a truck

  
And even spinning 
at relatively low speeds

  
these engines produce more than enough
thrust to maintain the necessary speed

  
for flying a passenger aircraft

  
But smaller engines simply can’t 
take in this much air

  
For most of the th century
engineers couldn’t produce an engine

  
small and light enough 
for an individual to wear

  
yet powerful enough to lift itself 
alongside its pilot and fuel

  
Designs could only carry enough fuel
for  seconds of flight

  
and when airborne 
the powerful thrust in a single direction

  
made jetpacks difficult
and dangerous to control

  
But the new millennium brought advances
in materials manufacturing

  
and computing technology

  
including systems which could manage
fuel injection with incredible precision

  
Together these dramatically improved 
the fuel efficiency

  
and powertoweight ratio of jet engines

  
By  microengines the size 
of a coffee can

  
and weighing less than kg

  
could achieve  Newtons of force

  
This was when an English engineer
named Richard Browning

  
saw the opportunity to create 
a new kind of lightweight jetpack

  
In addition to a single engine
strapped to the back

  
this socalled Jet Suit involved a pair
of microengines on each arm

  
to split and balance the thrust

  
Working with the back engine
these provided threepoints of stability

  
which some pilots describe as being 
akin to comfortably leaning on crutches

  
while a friend supports your back

  
It may seem complicated to manage
all these engines at once

  
but many pilots master 
it in less than a day

  
with the help of another 
advanced computer system— their brain

  
Various brain regions 
and multiple sensory systems

  
perfectly calibrate our sense of balance 
and spatial orientation

  
helping pilots smoothly
direct their flights

  
Slight movements of the arms allow
operators to increase and decrease lift

  
quickly turn in midair 
or glide forward for up to  minutes

  
This technology is still fairly new

  
and without major advances
in fuel efficiency and engine technology

  
don’t expect to have a jetpack
of your own any time soon

  
But if reaching for the sky
already got us this far

  
who knows where we'll fly next

  
Let's talk about regret

  
It is to my mind
our most misunderstood emotion

  
and so I decided to spend
a couple of years studying it

  
And one of the things
that I did is I went back

  
and I looked at about  years
of social science on regret

  
And here's what it tells you

  
I'll save you the trouble of reading
a half century of social science

  
The research tells us
that everybody has regrets

  
regrets make us human

  
Truly the only people
without regrets are fiveyearolds

  
people with brain damage and sociopaths

  
The rest of us we have regrets

  
and if we treat our regrets right
and that's a big if

  
but there are ways to do it

  
regrets can actually make us better

  
They can improve
our decisionmaking skills

  
improve our negotiation skills

  
make us better strategists
make us better problem solvers

  
enhance our sense of meaning

  
if we treat them right

  
And the good news is that there's
a systematic way to do that

  
But I want to take just a few minutes
to tell you about another aspect of regret

  
that I think is really really
just super interesting

  
As part of the research here

  
I decided to ask people for their regrets

  
and to my surprise

  
I ended up collecting about  regrets

  
from people in  countries

  
It’s an extraordinary trove

  
And what I realized when I went through
this incredible database

  
of human longing and aspiration

  
is that around the world

  
and there's very little
national difference here

  
people kept expressing
the same four regrets

  
Around the world
there are the same four regrets

  
that keep coming up
over and over and over again

  
So what I want to do is just
quickly tell you

  
about these four core regrets

  
because I think they reveal something
incredibly important and interesting

  
So the four core regrets
that I'm going to cover

  
Number one what I call
foundation regrets

  
Foundation regrets

  
These are people
who regret things like this

  
not saving enough money

  
which would be like you know
financial regret

  
not taking care of their health
and not eating right health regret

  
But they're the same

  
Those kinds of regrets
are about making choices

  
that didn't allow you
to have some stability

  
a stable platform for their life

  
I have a lot of people who regret
not working hard enough in school

  
A lot of people who regret 

  
I got a lot of regrets
about not saving money

  
And it reminds me a little bit
of Aesop’s fable

  
of the ant and the grasshopper

  
where earlier in their life they acted
like a grasshopper instead of the ant

  
and now it's catching up with them

  
So foundation regrets sound like this

  
"If only" 

  
And that's the catch phrase
of regret "if only" 

  
"If only I'd done the work"

  
Second category

  
I love this category it's fascinating

  
Boldness regrets

  
I have hundreds of regrets
around the world that go like this

  
“X years ago there was a man/woman
whom I really liked

  
I wanted to ask him/her out on a date

  
but I was too scared to do it

  
and I've regretted it ever since"

  
I also have hundreds of regrets
by people who said

  
"Oh I always wanted to start a business

  
but I never had the guts to do that"

  
People who said “Oh I wish
I’d spoken up more

  
I wish I'd said something
and asserted myself"

  
These are as I said before
what I call boldness regrets

  
And we get to a juncture in our life
and we have a choice

  
We can play it safe
or we can take the chance

  
And what I found is overwhelmingly

  
people regret not taking the chance

  
Even people who took the chance
and it didn't work out

  
don't really have many regrets about that

  
It's the people
who didn't take the chance

  
So this is boldness regrets

  
Boldness regrets sound like this

  
"If only I'd taken the chance"

  
Third category

  
Moral regrets

  
Very interesting
very interesting category

  
These are people who again

  
a lot of these regrets
begin at a juncture

  
You're at a juncture

  
you can do the right thing
or you can do the wrong thing

  
People do the wrong thing

  
and they regret it

  
I mean one of the ones
that really stuck with me

  
I'm going to try to pull it up here

  
is this one here this woman

  
She's a yearold woman in New Jersey

  
"When I was a kid

  
my mother would send me
to a small local store for a few items

  
I frequently would steal a candy bar
when the grocer wasn't looking

  
That's bothered me for about  years"

  
So yearold woman in New Jersey

  
for  years she's been bugged
by this moral breach

  
So moral regrets

  
We have people regretting bullying

  
we have people regretting
marital infidelity

  
All kinds of things

  
Moral regrets sound like this

  
“If only I’d done the right thing”

  
And finally our fourth category
or what I call connection regrets

  
Connection regrets are like this

  
You have a relationship
or ought to have a relationship

  
And it doesn't matter
what the relationship is

  
Kids parents siblings
cousins friends colleagues

  
but you have a relationship
or ought to have had a relationship

  
and the relationship comes apart

  
And what's interesting is that what these
 people were telling me

  
is that the way
these relationships come apart

  
is often not very dramatic

  
not very dramatic at all

  
They often come apart by drifting apart

  
rather than through
some kind of explosive rift

  
And what happens is that people
don't want to reach out

  
because they say it’s going to be
awkward to reach out

  
and the other side is not going to care

  
One of the lessons that I learned
from this book for myself

  
is always reach out

  
So that's what connection regrets are

  
"If only I'd reached out"

  
And so over and over and over again
we see these same regrets

  
Foundation regrets
“If only I’d done the work”

  
Boldness regrets
“If only I’d taken the chance”

  
Moral regrets “If only
I’d done the right thing”

  
And connection regrets
“If only I’d reached out”

  
And when we look at these regrets
so that's interesting in itself

  
but what I realized is that these 
four core regrets

  
operate as a kind of 
photographic negative of the good life

  
Because if we understand
what people regret the most

  
we actually can understand
what they value the most

  
And each of these regrets to my mind

  
reveals something fundamental
about humanity and about what we need

  
We need stability

  
Nobody wants to have an unstable life

  
We want a chance to learn
and grow and do something

  
We recognize that we are not here forever

  
and we want to do something
and try something

  
And at least feel
the exhilaration of being bold

  
Moral regrets I think most of us

  
almost all of us
want to do the right thing

  
At some level these moral regrets
are very heartening

  
The idea that people are bugged
for years decades

  
by these moral breaches
earlier in their life

  
I think most of us
want to do the right thing

  
And then connection regrets

  
We want love not love only
in the romantic sense

  
but love in the broader sense
of connection and relationship

  
and affinity with other people

  
And so in a weird way

  
this negative emotion of regret
points the way to a good life

  
By studying regret we know
what constitutes a good life

  
a life of stability

  
a life where you have a chance
to take a few risks

  
a life where you’re doing the right thing

  
and a life where you have people
who love you and whom you love

  
And so to me I started out saying

  
“Oh boy is this book
going to be a downer studying regret”

  
And it ended up being very uplifting

  
And so those are the four core regrets

  
Regret points us to the good life

  
And so I hope that you'll begin
to reckon with your own regrets

  
because I think they're going to give you
direction to a life well lived

  
Whitney Pennigton Rogers
Well thank you for that Dan

  
I was clapping behind the scenes
when you couldn't actually see me

  
for everyone who I know also really
appreciated what you shared there

  
First Dan you mentioned
you know this big takeaway

  
about how thinking about regret

  
can help us figure out
what is the recipe for the good life

  
I guess what has been your biggest
takeaway from doing this work beyond that

  
DHP I found it really interesting
how much people want to talk about this

  
and that's what got me on it
in the first place

  
That is I had an experience in my life

  
where one of my kids
graduated from college

  
and that sort of marker in my life
made me start thinking

  
about what regrets that I had

  
And I just mentioned it to a few people

  
and I found them like
leaning in to the conversation

  
So I was amazed at how much
people want to talk about this

  
and how much this taboo of like

  
“Oh I don’t have any regrets”
is so ridiculous

  
I mean it's absurd

  
And that if we actually
start talking about it

  
we're going to be better off

  
For me personally I think
that the biggest takeaway was the 

  
Was the connection regrets

  
Because I had so many people
who had the same story

  
where they had a friendship

  
some kind of relationship

  
and it comes apart

  
and they want to reach out and they say

  
"Oh no it's going to be really awkward

  
And the other side's not going to care"

  
And we're so wrong about that

  
It's not awkward and the other side
almost always appreciates it

  
And so for me

  
I guess the takeaway is
if I'm at a juncture in my life

  
where I'm thinking

  
“Should I reach out
or should I not reach out”

  
I've answered the question

  
That the answer to that question
at that juncture

  
if you reach that juncture

  
the answer is always reach out

  
You know especially coming out
a time like this Whitney

  
we need that sense of of connection

  
And so the ethic of always reaching out
to me is one of the best life lessons

  
that I've learned

  
WPR Well we're going to do something
a little interesting next Dan

  
which is have some Members
share their own regrets

  
And so I want to I guess

  
hand things over to you right now
so that you can bring in our first Member

  
and we can explore more

  
what this process of thinking
about making our regrets

  
help us live the good life
actually looks like

  
DHP Sure sure

  
And so let's bring on Lily

  
I don't want it to sound like a magic act
but Lily and I don't know each other

  
We haven't gone through this before

  
but what I want to try to do is actually

  
the hearing of the stories
of people's regrets

  
I think is super
interesting and revealing

  
We’re going to hear Lily’s regret

  
and we're going to talk through
what science says

  
might be some appropriate
responses to that

  
So Lily welcome

  
Lily Thank you hi everyone

  
DHP And tell us where you are

  
L I'm currently in Brooklyn New York

  
DHP Brooklyn is in the house
here at TED Membership

  
So Lily tell us you regret

  
L Yeah So my regret that I want to share

  
is that for most of my young adult life

  
from kindergarten really
straight through high school

  
is that I was painfully painfully shy

  
with really low selfconfidence

  
As I was thinking about this
I was remembering

  
and there were times where I just
wanted to close my eyes

  
and be invisible

  
And I think that you know my 

  
Like I didn't really come into my own
until I got to college

  
where I found a really great
group of friends

  
really like I was confident
in expressing myself

  
and you know just being myself

  
And I think that you know

  
my regret is that I just really wish
I had taken a little bit more effort

  
to build my confidence
to fight this a little bit more

  
because I worry about what opportunities
I might have missed

  
So ever since then I feel like
I try to counteract it now

  
And if ever I meet someone
who might be going through

  
especially if they're younger like going
through the same thing I did

  
I try to make them feel seen

  
and try to empathize
with how they're feeling

  
So that's kind of a takeaway
I guess from that regret

  
DHP But I mean it sounds like 

  
So is this a regret that's still with you

  
L I think 

  
DHP It sounds to me like you might have
sort of begun the process

  
of resolving it a little bit

  
L Absolutely

  
But I think that you know
even just you know prepping for this

  
I start to think about like you know

  
there could have been more things
that I could have done

  
if I had just put myself
a little bit out there

  
if I didn't just try to hide so much

  
DHP OK alright

  
This is fascinating Lily

  
and I have to say
I have this database of regrets

  
And you can search the database

  
And if I were to search the database

  
for the phrase "speak up"
"spoke up" "spoken up"

  
I would get huge
huge numbers of of people

  
It is one of the most common regrets

  
is that people regret not speaking up

  
The important thing about our regrets
that comes from the science is this

  
it's how we deal with them

  
So we can take that regret and say

  
"You know what

  
It doesn’t matter that I feel terrible
and I have this regret

  
because I'm just
going to ignore it" right

  
That's like the blithe
"no regrets" philosophy

  
That's a bad idea alright

  
The other way at it is to say

  
"Oh my God I have all these regrets

  
it's so terrible
I'm going to wallow in them"

  
That's a bad idea too

  
What we want to do

  
and I think that you've already done
a really brilliant job of it

  
is use these regrets as signals

  
Signals for our thinking;
what is it teaching me

  
And so there are a few things
in the research

  
that give us some clues about what to do

  
So one of them is this

  
So we start with sort of
reframing the regret

  
and how we think about it in ourselves

  
So do you think that you are the only
person with this kind of regret

  
L I don't know

  
DHP Not at all

  
I’m watching the chat man

  
Somebody said “Lily
you’re telling my story”

  
So one of the things
that we can do with our regret

  
is treat ourselves
with selfcompassion alright

  
Not boost our selfesteem

  
that's sometimes dangerous

  
Not rip ourselves down
with selfcriticism

  
but actually say

  
treat ourselves with kindness
rather than contempt

  
and recognize that what
we're going through

  
is part of the shared human experience

  
That's one thing

  
The second thing that we can do
is we can disclose our regret

  
And there are few things
that are interesting about disclosure

  
There's something amazing
why  people

  
were willing to share
their regrets with me

  
I mean like what's
going on there right

  
And the reason is that when
we disclose our regrets

  
we relieve some of the burden

  
That's one thing

  
The second thing that we do

  
is that when we actually talk
about our regrets

  
converting these kind of blobby mental
abstractions into concrete words

  
whether it's spoken or writing

  
defangs them

  
It begins the sensemaking process

  
And the other thing about disclosure

  
which is a dirty little secret
that I'll reveal to all of you

  
that comes out
in the research very clearly

  
is that when we disclose
our vulnerabilities and our weaknesses

  
people don't like us less

  
they actually like us more

  
Because they empathize with us

  
They respect our courage

  
And the final thing is to actually
try to extract a lesson from it

  
to use this regret

  
So what would you say Lily

  
is the lesson that you've learned
from this regret

  
L I think that 

  
What would have gone wrong if I 

  
DHP That's interesting

  
L If I were more open
about expressing myself

  
like people might discover
I'm a little weird

  
or they might think that maybe I'm nice

  
and hopefully maybe a little funny

  
So I think like maybe
that's one thing that jumps to mind

  
Like what could have gone wrong

  
You know

  
DHP So what's the lesson
that you have applied going forward

  
Taking this regret OK

  
so you've sort of treated yourself
with kindness rather than contempt

  
You've disclosed it
to all these people here

  
You've begun the sensemaking process
by talking about it and writing about it

  
What's a lesson that you can
extract from this

  
L I think that 

  
I'm not sure

  
DHP Well then let me tell you

  
(Laughs)

  
I think that the lesson is to 

  
Next time speak up

  
Next time speak up

  
Next time when you are at a juncture

  
"Should I speak up or not"

  
think about this

  
Think about this and speak up

  
Do you have any kind of work meetings
or anything coming on

  
where you're going to be
confronted with this

  
L Yeah and I think
that happens all the time

  
Like you know I have an idea

  
Oh but someone starts talking

  
and then like you just sort of
fade back into the background

  
and that’s something
I want to counteract more often

  
Because more often than not

  
you know that idea is a contribution

  
and why am I hesitating so much

  
DHP Yeah

  
So you have a lesson

  
The lesson is speak up

  
So why don't you 

  
So how about the next meeting you're in

  
when you have something to say
don't hesitate and speak up

  
L Done I'll do it

  
DHP OK but here's the thing

  
what I like about this is you've just
made a promise to  people

  
So you're on the hook

  
L I'm on the hook

  
DHP So this is it

  
So Lily has this regret

  
She's looking backwards saying
"Oh if only I'd spoken up"

  
and instead of beating herself up
she is divulging it

  
she's extracting a lesson from it

  
and she's taking that and applying
it to some next interaction

  
So this is what we do

  
This is how again looking backward
can move you forward

  
Lily that's such a fantastic 

  
People in the chat are saying
"We will hold Lily accountable"

  
which I love

  
So Lily thanks for that

  
We're going to bring 

  
I really really appreciate
your sharing that with us

  
and I want you to report back
that you did speak up

  
L I will thank you

  
DHP Thanks Lily

  
WPR Well we have a question here
from Claudia who asks

  
"Can you speak to the issue
of painful life regrets

  
Major opportunities lost

  
Do you have some advice

  
on how to avoid being paralyzed
by fear or further regret"

  
DHP Yeah

  
It’s interesting that Claudia
said “opportunities lost”

  
and let me pick up
on that phrase right here

  
Because one of the things
I saw in my own research

  
because I also did a huge survey
of the American population

  
where we surveyed

  
a representative sample of  Americans

  
about regret and how it worked

  
But one of the things you see widespread

  
is that there are
in the architecture of regret

  
there are often two kinds of regrets

  
One are regrets of action
and one are regrets of inaction

  
Regrets about what we did

  
Regrets about what we didn't do

  
And overwhelmingly
inaction regrets predominate

  
And that's what an opportunity lost is

  
With action regrets

  
we can try to undo them

  
We can make amends

  
We can look for the silver lining
and we can reduce the sting

  
For inaction regrets it is harder

  
And so the key here
on the opportunities lost

  
is to think about

  
you know really like
what are you going to do

  
You sort of reduce
the level of abstraction and say

  
"What are you going to do next time"

  
Not an abstraction of like
"Oh I'm going to be more bold"

  
It's like what are you
going to do next time

  
This is what we were talking
about with Lily

  
What are you going to do next time

  
All regrets begin at the juncture

  
You can go this way
or you can go that way

  
And so for Claudia I would say
the next time you're at this juncture

  
take the opportunity play it safe

  
Stop

  
think about your regret

  
and make the decision there

  
Or another thing that you could do

  
I'll give you another sort of
decisionmaking heuristic

  
Two of them in fact

  
When you're at that juncture
Claudia next time

  
go forward five years

  
This is called selfdistancing

  
Be Claudia five years from now
look back on Claudia today

  
What decision do you want

  
What decision does Claudia of 
want Claudia of  to make

  
It's very clear

  
Or the best decisionmaking
heuristic there is

  
You're at a juncture what would you tell
your best friend to do

  
When you ask people that
when they're trying to make a decision

  
say “What would you tell
your best friend to do”

  
Everybody always knows

  
So I think that's it

  
Remember the main thing though
is don't let it bog you down

  
Use it as a tool for thinking 
not as a tool for wallowing

  
not as a tool for ignoring 
but as a tool for thinking

  
WPR A question from Kim she's asking 

  
She says you're talking as if any
bad decision or mistake is also a regret

  
and I'm not sure
that that's always the case

  
Can you share your definition of regret

  
Especially after doing this project

  
What is your definition

  
DHP There's a difference between
a regret and a mistake alright

  
So you can make a mistake
and not regret it

  
because you say you immediately
learn something from it

  
or it was a worthy mistake

  
A regret is something where
you look backward at something

  
that where you had control
where you had some agency 

  
Where you had some agency
you did something that well

  
you did something wrong
and it sticks with you

  
It doesn't go away

  
And it sticks with you
for a very long time

  
So there's a big difference
for instance between 

  
I can make a mistake
and actually not regret it

  
because it's not significant enough
to me to linger right

  
So that's the difference
between a regret and a mistake

  
It's basically the duration

  
essentially the halflife
of the negative emotion

  
There's a huge difference
between regret and disappointment

  
Huge difference between regret
and disappointment

  
Because with disappointment
you don't have any kind of control

  
The great example of that
is from Janet Landman

  
a former professor at the University
of Michigan who to me is like

  
she tells the story of like OK
so a kid loses her third tooth

  
A sevenyearold loses her third tooth

  
She loses her tooth she goes to sleep

  
before she goes to sleep
she puts the tooth under the pillow

  
When she wakes up

  
the tooth is still there

  
The kid is disappointed

  
but the parents regret not leaving that 

  
So you have to have some agency
and it has to have a 

  
It has to have enough significance
that it stays with you

  
And once again going back
to these four core regrets

  
it ends up being the same kinds of 

  
it ends up being the same kinds of things

  
If you said "Oh I shouldn't
have bought that kind of car"

  
it might sting for a little bit
but the halflife is very very short

  
But other kinds of things
stick with us and stick with us

  
and those are the things
often of significance

  
WPR Thank you so much Dan
for chatting with us

  
and I love ending there
"If not now when"

  
And we'll see you soon

  
Thank you Dan

  
DHP Thanks a lot what a pleasure

When I was a kid
I lived in a pretty analog world

  
But then that all started
to quickly change

  
My music my communications
my social networks 

  
everything started to become digital

  
And the force behind it all
was this thing that seemed

  
at least to me
at the time almost magical

  
This thing called "software"

  
But then over time

  
I realized that software
isn't magic it's just logic

  
It's code that tells the computer
what to do and how to do it

  
And that early realization
really still sits at the core

  
of how I view my job as Microsoft's
Chief Environmental Officer

  
where I help the company play its part
in developing the code

  
behind one of the most complex programs
the world has ever dared to develop

  
a program that takes as input
all of the carbon

  
associated with all of the economic
activity on the planet

  
and returns as output the value zero

  
Zero additional carbon
accumulating in the atmosphere

  
by the year 

  
Now Microsoft's contribution to this
is both simple and ambitious

  
By  we’ve committed to reduce
our emissions by half or more

  
and then physically remove
the rest from the atmosphere

  
And then from  to 

  
to continue not just zeroing out
our annual emissions

  
but to go back in time and remove
all the emissions we're associated with

  
since we were founded in 

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
And what we've learned as a result

  
of our almost two years working
towards this target

  
is that any developer
of a netzero carbon program

  
really faces the same challenges
that your typical software engineer might

  
They must avoid bugs in their code

  
Bugs are errors that cause
a program not to work

  
or to do things that its author
didn't intend or doesn't understand

  
And if you know anything about software

  
you know that bugs are bad

  
Well unfortunately what's become clear

  
is that there are already
a few clearly significant bugs

  
in the world's early netzero program

  
For instance we lack a common meaning
of the term “netzero”

  
We lack a common unit of measurement

  
to assess the climate impact
of any netzero approach

  
And we’re failing to mature the markets
the world will need

  
to achieve a netzero
carbon economy by 

  
And so what I want to do
is just go into a few details I guess

  
on each of these bugs

  
and then talk really quickly

  
about how I think
we might be able to fix them

  
And first up is the meaning of “netzero”

  
Now the global definition
of netzero is pretty simple

  
all of the carbon that humans
put into the atmosphere

  
humans must take out

  
That sounds supersimple; as we all know

  
it's turning out to be
extremely difficult to do

  
but that's especially so
if you have not ensured alignment

  
between individual organizational
and global definitions of “netzero”

  
And I want to talk just really quickly
about what I mean by that

  
And to use an example to do so

  
let's pretend that you want
to go on vacation

  
a vacation that's going to require
transportation food and lodging

  
all activities that will emit let's say

  
three tonnes of carbon
into the atmosphere

  
But you want your trip to be netzero

  
Well today you really have
three options

  
You could of course
simply decide not to go

  
in which case your trip
wouldn’t be netzero

  
it would be absolute zero

  
Or you could decide
to continue on with your trip

  
but in this case pay somebody
on your behalf

  
to not emit three tonnes of carbon
that they otherwise would have

  
Now in accounting parlance

  
this is what's called
an avoided emissions offset

  
But it comes with a catch

  
Because while you may now be able to claim
your emissions to be netzero

  
and thus your trip to be netzero

  
as a result of canceling out
your emissions with those of someone else

  
you're relying on an approach
that we know simply can't scale

  
to a global netzero outcome

  
And the reason that that is true

  
is simply because carbon
will still be emitted although less

  
but not removed

  
In the third option 

  
it's similar to the second 

  
you're going to continue
to go on your trip

  
but in this case
you're going to pay somebody

  
to physically remove
three tonnes of carbon

  
from the atmosphere on your behalf

  
And this type of payment
called a carbonremoval offset

  
could theoretically scale
from individual to organizational

  
to global netzero outcomes

  
But in order to do so

  
it's going to have to have significant
technological advances and breakthroughs

  
to achieve the scale necessary

  
But the point here is really simple

  
it's that in today's terminology
zero is not always zero

  
It depends on your definition

  
And that is a problem

  
And it's a problem that brings us
to the second bug in our netzero program

  
problems with measurement

  
and specifically

  
problems with the way
that we do or don't measure

  
the climate impacts
of different carbon offsets

  
Because not all offsets are created equal

  
The additionality of a project

  
the certainty with which you know
that carbon will be avoided or removed

  
the duration of time over which
your investment will remain valid

  
Those and a whole host of other factors 

  
they all influence the climate impacts
of your investments

  
But today we don't do enough
to measure those differences

  
And we have to do better

  
because if we can't appropriately measure

  
the climate impacts
that those differences represent

  
then we'll never be able
to appropriately assign

  
the correct monetary value
to any particular offset

  
And if we can't get the valuation right

  
from both a climate
and a financial perspective

  
then we're not going to mature
the markets that we need

  
And the reason for this
is actually pretty simple

  
because it turns out
to be relatively cheap

  
to pay somebody to stop doing something

  
And so avoided emissions offsets

  
can often be purchased
for less than  dollars

  
per tonne of carbon avoided

  
Carbonremoval offsets on the other hand

  
often span prices from the high tens
to hundreds to low thousands of dollars

  
per tonne of carbon removed

  
particularly for advanced
technology solutions

  
like direct air capture

  
which literally sucks carbon
out of the atmosphere

  
and stores it permanently
deep under the Earth's surface

  
But if each of these types of offsets
counted the same

  
for your carbon accounting

  
which would you choose

  
Well most organizations
will choose the cheapest option

  
and that might make sense for them
from a financial perspective

  
but it causes significant
market dysfunction

  
because it starves early
emerging and scalable solutions

  
that we know we will need in the future;

  
it starves them of desperately
needed early capital

  
and it ultimately slows
or stunts their growth

  
And at Microsoft we’ve experienced this
because for nearly a decade

  
we were a significant purchaser
of avoided emissions offsets

  
before switching our strategy
to only purchasing carbon removal

  
And in fact just last year

  
we purchased  million metric tons
of carbon removal

  
And as a result of that purchase

  
what we learned
is that Microsoft's demand alone

  
represents a significant fraction
of all of the carbon removal

  
available on the world's markets today

  
And so when you take this all together

  
what you quickly realize
is that the world's early netzero program

  
simply won't compute

  
It's predicated on a poorly defined
program structure

  
where carbon is still emitted
but not removed

  
and where markets don't mature

  
Now that all sounds pretty depressing

  
and I would say I wouldn't be doing my job

  
if I didn't think these problems
could be fixed

  
if I didn't think that these bugs
in the software couldn't be bashed

  
But doing so is going to require
all of us to accept

  
an extremely significant
amount of urgency

  
to realize that there is a whole lot
of hard work ahead

  
and the need for a plan

  
A fourpoint plan 
at least in my opinion

  
there needs to be a fourpoint plan 

  
a plan that shares a single
common global definition of netzero

  
not an organizational or individual one

  
A plan that deploys a single
common unit of measurement

  
so that we can appropriately
compare and contrast

  
the climate and financial impacts
of any type of netzero investment

  
A plan that records
the carbon inputs and outputs

  
of every organization and country on Earth

  
so that we can appropriately map out
and assess progress

  
towards a netzero future

  
And a plan that uses market maturation

  
at such a scale that develops markets

  
to the scale that the world needs
for every individual and organization

  
so that they can rely on these markets

  
not just a few individuals
and a few organizations

  
And so we now find ourselves collectively
coding this program update

  
against the clock

  
and the urgency could not be greater

  
But what I want to urge everyone
is to constantly remind ourselves

  
to always predicate our work on logic

  
Because if we can do that

  
then we can be confident in our ability

  
to pull off the most seemingly
magical feat of all

  
a recoding of our current course
on climate change

  
and a promise for a more
sustainable future

  
to generations to come

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Hello

  
So as you know

  
my comfort zone isn’t here

  
It’s usually on set

  
behind a camera

  
like him

  
or him

  
But I’m very happy to be here

  
So yes I was born in Beirut Lebanon

  
It’s what I call my home country

  
It’s the place
where my first memories are

  
where my parents live

  
where my first loves are

  
my first heartbreaks

  
I’ve lived in other places

  
and I’ve made them home

  
like New York

  
which I’ve fallen in love with 

  
and in

  
But I always felt
like my biggest strength

  
came from the fact that I knew
exactly where I came from

  
And that knowledge
was very important to me

  
because it really defines
who I am as a woman

  
But growing up in Lebanon
comes with a price

  
I think this tension and this 

  
what I have between my home country 
is something I cherish

  
but it’s also a burden

  
because Lebanon is a place
with a very contradicting soul

  
It’s a place filled with chaos and poetry;

  
a place where hope and despair coexist
in really strange ways

  
It’s also a place where joy
and sorrow are inseparable

  
like Khalil Gibran 

  
in one of my favorite poems
by our national poet

  
Khalil Gibran mentions “that well
from which comes our laughter

  
is also the one that hosts our tears”

  
And I think today more than ever
this is true in Lebanon

  
because after everything that happened

  
it feels like a land of broken dreams

  
but filled with so many
dreams nonetheless

  
And growing up in Lebanon

  
we were constantly
on the verge of the worst

  
We felt like that silence
between [one] crisis and the other

  
was almost more agonizing
than the crisis itself

  
And that really defined us
as human beings

  
because we really live every day
as if it were our last

  
and that’s in the best
and the worst kind of ways

  
I think this is where
the screenwriter in me was born

  
at home in Lebanon

  
in the streets at home

  
and the house I grew up in

  
because I became fascinated
with human flaws and vulnerabilities

  
and the truth that comes out of us
in times of crisis

  
and when we’re put under pressure

  
And when at home

  
when I saw the people I loved the most

  
my parents

  
be real

  
I felt free somehow

  
It wasn’t always pretty 
but at least it felt safe

  
like this is a place
where we can be ourselves

  
But in 

  
when the pandemic hit the planet

  
we all started questioning
what home meant

  
My parents were architects 

  
are architects

  
so they also added to what I felt home
was to my definition of home

  
Because before following
my own dreams 

  
being a filmmaker 

  
I was a good daughter

  
a good girl

  
and I followed my father’s dreams

  
and I studied architecture and finished

  
And what I learned in architecture school
is how much you can learn about people

  
about their story

  
about societies through the spaces
that they inhabit

  
through every object

  
every frame every wall

  
through the ground

  
through the streets

  
But what do you do

  
when you feel like the ground
on which you’re standing might not hold

  
In the world of today

  
filled with political instability

  
climate disasters where our spaces
are constantly ravaged and threatened

  
how do you create a sense of home

  
In  when the pandemic hit

  
we all felt 

  
or at least those of us
lucky enough to have homes 

  
we all went inside

  
and that became our safe space

  
The outside world became the threat

  
the air the people

  
This invisible monster was outside

  
But as long as you were
tucked in your bubble

  
you were safe

  
And I’m talking about those of us

  
who are lucky enough not to live
locked with an abuser

  
victims of domestic abuse

  
So for those of us

  
the safe bubble was inside

  
Or so we thought

  
On August   in Lebanon

  
our lives changed

  
In a split of a second

  
one of the largest nonnuclear
explosions pulverized our port

  
and destroyed half our city

  
killing many people

  
and destroying homes

  
and creating losses
that we can’t even count until today

  
And there still hasn’t been
accountability for what happened

  
even though it was the result of years
of political mismanagement and corruption

  
I happened on that day to be in Beirut

  
in the center of Beirut

  
in the office

  
because I was in preproduction
for my first feature film

  
“Costa Brava Lebanon”

  
a film we had been working on
for a few years really hard

  
and a film that ironically is the story
of a family that decides to leave Beirut

  
a place that doesn’t feel safe
to them anymore

  
to create a utopic mountain home

  
a selfsustainable mountain home

  
away from a city
that has broken their hearts

  
This is the cast of the film

  
And then what happens

  
is that their utopia
is completely destroyed

  
when the government decides

  
to build an illegal garbage landfill
right outside their home

  
bringing that reality
to their front door 

  
the one they have been
running away from for many years

  
The family finds itself
again confronted to this destruction

  
that it had been trying to avoid

  
facing everything it was trying
to protect itself from

  
I was with the crew the cast
and the crew of the film

  
in the office in Gemmayze in Beirut

  
when at six or seven

  
in the split of a second

  
our lives were turned upside down

  
We went from a creative meeting
filled with passion and love

  
and excitement

  
to looking for each other under rubble

  
wondering if we had all made it alive

  
Luckily we did

  
and we were much luckier
than a lot of people in the same street

  
My cinematographer Joe
almost lost his eye

  
and everyone was injured

  
We got out of the street

  
and realized that the explosion
was not just next to the office

  
but everywhere

  
and that’s when we understood
how big it was

  
Walking down the street like zombies
around that time

  
surrounded by broken
confused stunned faces

  
felt like walking in the set of a movie
I don’t want to direct or be a part of

  
Everyone’s homes

  
their private spaces

  
their frames their walls

  
were dust on which we were walking

  
We stopped everything at that moment

  
because we lost all of our coordinates

  
all of our sense of home

  
everything that we had worked for

  
So what we did is we just took
a moment for two months

  
and each of us took time to grieve

  
to assess the losses

  
whether it was the office or all of us

  
Anyway how can you even think
about being creative

  
or making anything

  
at a moment where you feel
like you’re living hell 

  
in the middle of hell

  
You cannot create amidst such chaos

  
At that moment

  
my mother 

  
my hero on that day

  
because it’s only thanks to her
that some of us made it to a hospital

  
who has lived civil wars 

  
reminded me of a book I read
in architecture school

  
“Invisible Cities” by Italo Calvino

  
I’ll read to you the quote
that she read to me at that time

  
when she saw the despair
me and my team were in

  
“The hell of the living
is not something that will be

  
If there is one

  
it is what is already here

  
the hell we live every day
that we make by being together

  
There are two ways to escape suffering it

  
The first is easy for many

  
accept the hell

  
and become such a part of it
that you can no longer see it

  
The second is risky

  
and demands constant vigilance
and apprehension

  
seek and learn to recognize who and what
in the midst of hell are not hell

  
then make them endure
give them space”

  
Luckily these people
were not too far from me

  
There were the cast
and the crew of this film

  
so we met all together and brainstormed

  
We thought should we make
this film or not

  
It seemed crazy to make anything
around that time in Lebanon

  
because the country
was experiencing until now

  
its worst economic crisis
since its inception

  
the loss and the destruction

  
and the PTSD we were
all going through after the explosion

  
and also the global pandemic

  
which was hitting the country really hard

  
which we had almost forgotten about

  
because of everything else
that was happening

  
But at a moment where existing
felt like an act of resistance

  
we felt like making this movie
was very important

  
because it would mean regaining agency 

  
to regain agency

  
and feel like they haven't
taken everything from us

  
And as Maya Angelou says

  
there’s nothing more agonizing

  
than an untold story
hanging inside of you 

  
not directly quoting

  
And I think we really needed
to regain a sense of order

  
find our coordinate

  
a sense of home

  
And like after World War I

  
a lot of European artists
went back into classicism

  
trying to run away
from this feeling of destruction

  
that the war had brought in

  
and stepped away from
the experimentalism that came before

  
I think we used creativity
to rebuild those pillars and that order

  
So it was a crazy decision

  
but we did it because we wanted to

  
and because something was driving us

  
So we went and made the film
against all odds

  
And it was hard

  
it was filled with obstacles

  
but it was beautiful

  
because at a moment
where we had missed human connection

  
and at a moment where our societies
are becoming more fragile and loveless

  
we were able to recreate
a moment of warmth

  
of love and magic

  
at a moment where it was hard to find any

  
And I think that that was very special

  
because telling the story
together gave us 

  
a sense of home again

  
It felt like the set became
that safe space

  
that family

  
And it was as real and as raw
as the home I was telling you about

  
Because we were all filled with creativity

  
and a desire to make something

  
but we are also grieving and broken

  
So that was me again

  
realizing the beauty of being surrounded
by people as real as me

  
even if it was not always pretty

  
but it was real

  
And I think that courage and 

  
we were always told to go to that place
that is the place of great pain

  
because it’s also a place
of great inspiration

  
I think that it’s easy to hear and to say

  
but it’s really hard to achieve

  
I think that courage to go there

  
to go where it hurts
when you’re so broken

  
came to me from those people

  
this cast and crew

  
that really really gave me the courage

  
to want to tell the story

  
and reminded me of the importance of it

  
And I want to mention
also those two girls

  
I actually have twins
who played the role of Rim

  
the protagonist of the film

  
and they both shared the role

  
And I think working with them
was a great learning experience for me

  
because that’s the beauty
of being a filmmaker

  
You work with people from different ages

  
and different backgrounds all the time

  
and working with them

  
for all of us on set

  
was a reminder of the importance
of remaining hopeful

  
and keeping the sense of wonder

  
especially for their generation

  
Because whatever world
we’re fighting for today

  
they will be able to benefit from

  
And so I know that we all deal with loss
and rebuilding a home that we lost

  
in different ways

  
For me it was through human connection

  
and understanding that it wasn't
necessarily a space anymore

  
And I think for you
it might be something else

  
We all channel that in different ways

  
But for me

  
that moment of joy of sorrow of freedom

  
of creativity

  
that moment between
the “action” and the “cut”

  
that’s what felt like home

  
And I’m very grateful for that

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
In  two sculptures meant to represent
the average man and woman

  
in the United States

  
went on exhibit
at the American Museum of Natural History

  
Based on measurements taken from tens
of thousands of young men and women

  
they were called Norma and Normman

  
That same year a contest launched
to find a living embodiment of Norma

  
Normal is often used as a synonym
for “typical” “expected”

  
or even “correct”

  
By that logic most people should fit 
the description of normal

  
And yet not one of almost  women 
who participated in the contest

  
matched Norma
the supposedly “normal” woman

  
This puzzle isn’t unique 
to Norma and Normman either—

  
time and time again 
socalled normal descriptions

  
of our bodies minds and perceptions 
have turned out to match almost no one

  
And yet a lot of the world is constructed
around a foundation of normalcy

  
So what does normal actually mean—
and should we be relying on it so much

  
In statistics a normal distribution 
describes  a set of values

  
that fall along a bell curve

  
The average or mean of all the values
is at the very center

  
and most other values fall 
within the hump of the bell

  
These curves can be tall with most values
inside a narrow range

  
or long and flat with only a slight bias
towards the average

  
What makes the distribution normal 
is that it follows this curved shape

  
Normal doesn’t describe a single data 
point but a pattern of diversity

  
Many human traits like height
follow a normal distribution

  
Some people are very tall or very short

  
but most people fall close 
to the overall average

  
Outside of statistics normal
often refers to an average—

  
like the single number pulled 
from the fattest part of the bell curve—

  
that eliminates all the nuance
of the normal distribution

  
Norma and Norman’s proportions
came from such averages

  
Applied to individuals 
whether someone is considered normal

  
usually depends on how closely 
they hew to this average

  
At best such definitions of normal 
fail to capture variation

  
But oftentimes our calculations of normal
are even more flawed

  
Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index

  
BMI is a measure of weight
relative to height

  
with different ratios 
falling into “underweight”

  
“normal weight” “overweight”
and “obese” ranges

  
Generally only BMIs that correspond
to normal weight are considered healthy

  
But BMI is not always 
an accurate predictor of health

  
or even of what’s a healthy weight

  
BMI doesn’t take into account 
body fat percentage

  
body fat distribution levels of physical
activity or blood pressure

  
And yet those who fall outside
the socalled normal range

  
are commonly advised that losing
or gaining weight

  
will improve their health

  
When we apply a standard of normal
to all of humanity

  
that’s based on data 
from a nonrepresentative slice

  
we’re not just choosing one
point on the distribution

  
we’re choosing it 
from the wrong distribution

  
A lot of behavior science research draws
from samples that are pretty WEIRD—

  
meaning Western educated 
industrialized rich and democratic

  
These features can skew norms

  
even in research that doesn’t have
an obvious link to them

  
Take the famed 
MullerLyer optical illusion

  
it’s normal to think one 
of the two lines is longer

  
when they’re actually the same length

  
At least it is if you’re
an American undergraduate

  
A team of anthropologists 
and psychologists

  
found other demographic groups
were much less susceptible—

  
members of the San people of the Kalahari

  
weren’t susceptible 
to the illusion at all

  
When these limited or inaccurate
definitions of normal

  
are used to make decisions 
that impact people’s lives

  
they can do real harm

  
Historically such concepts of normal
have been hugely influential

  
The Eugenics Movement of the early th 
century weaponized the concept of normal

  
using it to justify exclusion violence 
and even extermination

  
of those deemed not normal

  
To this day people are often targeted
and discriminated against

  
on the basis of disabilities 
mental health issues sexual orientations

  
gender identities and other features
deemed “not normal”

  
But the reality is that the differences
in our bodies minds

  
perceptions and ideas about
the world around us—

  
in short diversity— 
is the true normal

  
So what do you think of
when you think of the ocean

  
Maybe you think of a visit to the beach

  
or whales or sharks or coral reefs

  
I think of this

  
This is the San Juan Islands
in Washington state

  
They jut out of an expanse
of deep dark water

  
and they're filled with life
and mystery and opportunity

  
But whatever you think of
the ocean is much more

  
It is a complex physical chemical
and biological system

  
that takes up  percent of our planet

  
And yet we're still really
just beginning to understand it

  
What we do know

  
is that the ocean is a vital part
of our life support system on the planet

  
It produces at least  percent
of the oxygen that we breathe

  
So more than one in every two breaths

  
It also regulates temperature
for the planet

  
So without the ocean
the poles would be unbearably cold

  
and the equator would be unbearably hot

  
and it would be a lot harder to live here

  
Now we think about saving the ocean
from plastic or from oil and oil spills

  
or from overfishing

  
But really we should be thinking
about how the ocean is saving us

  
And what is it saving us from

  
It's saving us from the climate change
that we are creating

  
Essentially ourselves

  
And so what does that mean

  
Basically what we need to do is think
about not how to save the ocean

  
but instead how the ocean
can actually help us

  
in this fight against climate change

  
Already the ocean is absorbing
 to  percent of the CO

  
that we release into the atmosphere

  
It is the world's largest carbon sink

  
The ocean has also absorbed
 percent of the excess heat

  
trapped by greenhouse gases

  
So it is basically helping
to keep the planet habitable

  
at least for now

  
And yet when we think
about climate action

  
and climate strategies and climate plans

  
we often overlook the ocean
and leave it out

  
because somehow we think
that saving the ocean

  
is something else we have to do

  
not a core part of our climate strategy

  
And that's what has to change

  
because the ocean is a core part
of our climate system

  
and so it has to be a core part
of our climate solutions

  
So what does that actually mean

  
Well for starters we know that the ocean
is already doing a lot for us

  
So the first thing we do need to do
to save the ocean to save ourselves

  
is to actually reduce emissions

  
I don't think anyone here
would disagree with that

  
But that still sounds like the ocean
is a victim in the story

  
and really the ocean can and should
be a hero in this story

  
The ocean can provide us with solutions
to help us reduce those emissions

  
and it can also help us to adapt

  
to this new climate reality
that we've created

  
So how does that happen

  
Well essentially the first
thing we need to do

  
is to make sure that we keep
all of these systems working

  
and protect the systems
that are protecting us

  
Because all of that CO and heat
that the ocean is absorbing

  
is actually coming at a cost

  
The ocean is warming
and rising and acidifying

  
and we even have evidence now

  
that we're changing
the basic circulation of the ocean

  
which changes the way
it regulates temperature

  
So the first thing we need to do
is really just protect those systems

  
that are protecting us

  
But how do we more actively
engage the ocean

  
in our climate strategies

  
What can we do to really use the ocean
to help us reduce emissions

  
and to adapt to the impacts
of climate change

  
What does that practically look like

  
Well we know that coastal
ocean ecosystems

  
like mangroves or seagrasses
or salt marshes

  
are some of the most effective
carbon sinks on the planet

  
Acre for acre they can absorb  times
more carbon than a forest on land

  
And that carbon is very deep in the soils

  
so that it can stay there
for thousands of years

  
if we leave it undisturbed

  
The problem is that we’re not
leaving it undisturbed;

  
we are destroying these places

  
We’ve lost  to  percent
of them already

  
and we lose more every year

  
And all of that is creating emissions

  
But if we protect those places
then those emissions stop

  
Just like if you shut off
a coalfired power plant

  
And if we restore those places

  
then we can actually absorb
even more carbon

  
But the power of the ocean isn't limited
just to reducing emissions

  
The ocean can also help us to adapt
to the impacts of climate change

  
we already feel

  
and that we know will be here
with us for decades

  
Those same mangroves
can actually protect coastal communities

  
by buffering them against
more intense coastal storms

  
and slowing wind and waves

  
Another example oysters

  
In New York City they're using oysters

  
to help reduce the risk
of major floods and flood damage

  
like they saw during
Superstorm Sandy in 

  
The idea is that these reefs
form dense places

  
that force water through nooks
and crannies that slow it down

  
So by the time it hits the shore

  
it actually has less power
and therefore can do less damage

  
And at the same time
they're creating aquatic parks

  
and places where people can gather
and be with nature

  
Because the truth is that in this new
climate reality that we've created

  
we will have to learn how to live
with water and with the ocean

  
in new ways

  
And so what better ways to do that
than with the creatures

  
that actually have evolved
to live in these land and sea interfaces

  
And these are real solutions
that are being implemented in real places

  
based on what we know about the ocean now

  
And yet the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Association

  
of the United States

  
estimates that  percent
of the ocean is unmapped

  
unexplored and unobserved

  
So there is so much more out there
that we could be doing

  
and thinking about as climate solutions

  
and so much that we're just
still getting our imaginations around

  
For example

  
what if we could actually
harness the power

  
of the ocean's wind and waves
and tides to produce power

  
The International Energy Agency estimates

  
that offshore wind alone could produce
enough energy for the Earth

  
and  other planets carbonfree

  
And at the same time

  
we could actually be providing power
to coastal communities and islands

  
that don't benefit from our
current grids and systems

  
And if we're really smart about it

  
we can plan and design these systems
so that we're creating artificial reefs

  
that could support wildlife
and aquaculture

  
and help us grow food and sequester carbon

  
and actually help the ocean
instead of harm it

  
Or what if we could harness more
of the ocean's biological power

  
to help us in this fight
against climate change

  
For example kelp

  
Kelp is one of the fastestgrowing
organisms on the planet

  
It can grow two feet per day

  
What if we could actually restore
the world's kelp forests

  
and actually grow kelp at a scale

  
that we could use
all of that growing power

  
to help us sequester carbon

  
Now that's likely to be a lot cheaper

  
than trying to deploy
humanmade technologies

  
out into the middle of the ocean

  
to sequester carbon

  
And it's likely to be a lot less risky
than changing the ocean's chemistry

  
or engineering the ocean

  
because we'd actually be working
with the natural systems

  
instead of against them

  
And we'd probably have
a lot of kelp left over

  
that we could use to feed
ourselves and feed animals

  
and create plastic alternatives

  
that would also help us
to lower our footprint on the planet

  
And this is just a sampler
of the types of solutions

  
that the ocean has to offer
for the climate crisis

  
The key is that we have to think
about the ocean as a source of solutions

  
that we can be using
and enlist it in this fight

  
And these aren't easy solutions

  
The time for that has passed

  
We don't have any easy solutions left

  
And these aren't excuses
for not doing other things

  
these are not silver bullets

  
So we still have to do the hard work

  
of reducing and getting rid
of fossil fuels

  
and we still have to do
the hard work of making sure

  
that the most vulnerable among us
will be able to adapt and thrive

  
in the new climate reality

  
But the ocean is a powerful
source of solutions

  
that we've overlooked for far too long

  
And so we need to think

  
about how we really integrate it
into our strategies now

  
And that comes down
to a fundamental change in mindset

  
which is instead of thinking
about how we save the ocean

  
we should be thinking
about how we can help the ocean save us

  
Thank you

Director TED Best Buy
Tim Dunn take one

  
Tim Dunn The climate crisis that we're in
can be so daunting to think about

  
it's so systemic

  
How do I as an individual

  
step into this space
and make a difference

  
Just think of your house or your apartment
where you have everything on

  
Plugging your refrigerator in
big energy draw in your house;

  
plugging your TV in
full family entertainment

  
there's another energy draw

  
You take your stove your dishwasher

  
your clothes washer your clothes dryer

  
If you take those minor things
that we do every day

  
and you can influence that

  
that is the picture
that we can draw to say

  
here's where we can have the impact

  
[In the Green The Business
of Climate Action]

  
[Presented by TED Countdown
and The Climate Pledge]

  
[Tim Dunn; Company Best Buy;
Sector Electronics; Location USA]

  
We are a large retailer

  
unique in a sense
that most thing that we sell

  
plug in have a battery

  
consume energy in some way

  
The use of a product sold
is part of our emissions inventory

  
Everything we've put out into the market
that's plugging in to the electrical grid

  
we are in some form part
of that ownership for that carbon

  
When we started putting pen to paper
and saw the carbon impact

  
of the use of products that we sell

  
it was  times that of our own operation

  
So that’s where we set out to say
if you’re plugging in at home

  
that has to be part
of our goals to reduce it

  
We went through and looked at what items
are we putting into customers homes

  
that do have a significant energy draw

  
So it was at that point we started
to see the scope of Energy Star

  
Energy Star is a partnership at the EPA
and Department of Energy in the US

  
to set a standard to develop
the most energy efficient product

  
How can you make this thing work its best

  
but consume the least amount
of energy in that process

  
And that became the conversation
with our vendors

  
If we can have an impact
on that customer's energy bill

  
helping them live more sustainably

  
that's your story too

  
And so we can go from a customer
plugging in a new product

  
being thrilled with their experience

  
to  customers to  customers

  
Our next step is how sustainable
that product is at end of life

  
Circularity is what we need to get to

  
We're going to account for that

  
When a customer brings that product home

  
that's just one part of the interaction

  
Once that product has met
its end of life for that customer

  
bring us that product back

  
We will evaluate that product to say
Is there any use in tradein

  
Does it need to be repaired

  
We'll put it through our repair process

  
If it's truly end of life

  
we will put it into our recycling programs
that have vetted partners

  
held to the highest standards

  
that's fulfilling the customer
promise end to end

  
but it's also fulfilling our environmental
obligations end to end

  
At the core of it every single product
that we're putting in customers homes

  
we are there through every single
point of that product life

  
Global climate change
is impacting us on a scale 

  
our stores our employees
our customers 

  
that not doing something about it
is an impact to our business

  
The time is now to make a difference
and accelerate all of our goals

  
and get to netzero by 

  
Avocados

  
Americans love them

  
For what other food
would you pay  dollars

  
to have someone bring it to your table
and mash it up in front of you

  
There's probably a hipster
in Brooklyn right now

  
ordering a dollar
avocado toast as we speak

  
And that's on the cheap side

  
Give me like  dollars

  
I mean that's insanity honestly

  
So I have a question

  
Why would people pay seemingly
absurd prices for something so simple

  
Marketing

  
There was probably a time in the US

  
when you couldn't pay
people to eat avocados

  
and actually they were known
as “alligator pears”

  
And then something changed

  
In the s

  
there was a Super Bowl marketing campaign

  
where NFL players shared
their favorite guacamole recipes

  
With the help of this over time

  
avocados went from a relative
obscurity in the US

  
to one of the most consumed fruits

  
Now what’s interesting about this
is who was behind the campaign

  
Californian avocado farmers

  
They had a product

  
they funded a highly visible
and successful marketing campaign

  
put money in their pockets and ultimately
changed the way people eat

  
So today I want to talk to you
about how marketing can be a catalyst

  
to improve the livelihoods of farmers

  
but not in the US in Africa

  
And how the development community

  
and by that I mean NGOs philanthropists

  
and international development agencies

  
can use marketing
to positively impact society

  
the economy and the environment

  
So I am South African and American

  
I have lived and worked throughout Africa

  
with a professional focus
on food and agriculture

  
And I've had the opportunity
to study lots of development programs

  
and even work on some myself

  
And through that I have met farmers

  
spoken to them
and some of them have said

  
"I have a product

  
but I don't have a market
in which to sell it"

  
Or "I have a market but it's too small"

  
So I want to talk
about how to change that

  
Now just a reminder
Africa is a continent not a country

  
And in subSaharan Africa

  
agriculture makes up
a large part of the economy

  
It makes up  percent of GDP

  
about  percent of employment

  
and many of the people
in agriculture are smallholders

  
So they live on less
than two hectares of land

  
and have very small incomes that put them
at or below the poverty line

  
For decades the development community
has been trying to change this

  
primarily with a supply sidefocus
of working with farmers

  
giving them access to seeds
and fertilizers

  
showing them how to improve
their productivity

  
so that they could grow more

  
have more to sell and eat

  
and ultimately increase their incomes

  
which is the end goal

  
Billions of dollars
have been spent on this

  
And unfortunately today
many African farmers are still poor

  
So why is that

  
Well farmers are part of the equation

  
They supply food but obviously we know
the other part of the equation is demand

  
They need to have demand
for the goods that they're growing

  
And it's true that the international
development community

  
is increasingly linking farmers to markets

  
so that they have places
to sell what they grow

  
And that's good

  
But they need to go a step further

  
by proactively helping to shape
and grow markets

  
for goods grown by African farmers

  
So in other words

  
in addition to sending
seeds and fertilizer

  
they need to send them
advertising geniuses

  
So I'm going to share a couple of examples

  
of the type of impact marketing can have

  
And I’m going to refer to the US a lot

  
and that's because the US knows
how to do this really well

  
Maybe a little too well some might argue

  
but that's not the topic
of the talk today

  
So this is the slogan

  
of arguably one of the most iconic
ad campaigns of all time

  
[got milk]

  
Funded by American dairy farmers

  
What's very interesting
about dairy in the US

  
is that companies don't leave it
up to individual businesses

  
to market their brands

  
They actually work together
as an industry to promote milk drinking

  
And they do this by you know

  
many companies contributing
to a common fund

  
that goes towards campaigns like this

  
Now they have a little help
from government also

  
How many of you went to school
and got milk on your tray

  
In many instances
that milk was subsidized

  
Actually the National School Lunch Program
dates back to the s

  
and it's still ongoing today

  
You go to school you taste something
it's at a good price

  
you keep getting it you like it
maybe you start eating more of it

  
You purchase at home stock your fridge

  
Does that sound anything
like product promotion and sampling

  
Importantly what this does is it creates
a whole category of consumers

  
And it gives farmers a constant market
in which to sell what they grow

  
and that's actually
really important right

  
You can't create a product

  
if you don't know that there's going to be
constant demand for it in the market

  
Now this combination of industry marketing
plus government support

  
is quite powerful

  
So powerful in fact
that the United States

  
has one of the highest rates
of consumption of dairy in the world

  
 pounds of dairy per person per year

  
Try to imagine that

  
That's a lot right

  
Now this has actually been done
outside of the US too

  
In Kenya in the s
under former president Moi

  
there was a National School Milk Program

  
dubbed Nyayo Milk

  
and many Kenyan children went to school
and received packets of milk

  
So it became a lot more
a part of the local diet

  
And as they grew up
they continued to consume it

  
And today Kenya has the highest rate
of consumption of dairy

  
in East Africa

  
And it's got a much more
developed dairy industry

  
than its regional neighbors

  
Now both of those examples
are about marketing to domestic consumers

  
But you're probably thinking

  
"Well what about you know

  
in countries where there's lower
purchasing power"

  
You can use marketing to create
demand beyond borders as well

  
If you've ever watched the Super Bowl

  
and I never thought I'd talk so much
about the Super Bowl

  
because I kind of don't watch it

  
But if you have ever watched
the Super Bowl

  
and you’ve heard this jingle
“Avocados from Mexico” 

  
and you kind of have to dance
when you sing it

  
because it’s just so catchy honestly 

  
if you’ve heard that jingle

  
then you've been marketed to
by the Mexican avocado industry

  
Mexico exports  billion dollars worth
of avocados to the US every year

  
That's obviously a lot of avocados

  
and a lot of money
going to Mexican avocado farmers

  
And Kenya exports avocados too
but not that much

  
So you know this is all
about how they can do that

  
Now I've talked about milk avocados

  
but how many of you eat kale
or pomegranate or blueberries

  
because you've heard
that they're superfoods

  
packed full of antioxidants

  
That's marketing

  
So how do we take these examples
that I've talked about

  
and use them to improve
the livelihoods of farmers

  
Three things

  
First development community

  
Increase funding for demand
in addition to supply

  
So in addition to funding
farmers to grow food

  
donors need to fund worldclass
marketing campaigns

  
that help farmers to sell food

  
This should be done at local
regional and international levels

  
helping to promote the foods
grown by African farmers

  
and create trade within Africa

  
but also outside African borders

  
with consumers in wealthier countries

  
Second governments

  
Use your budgets to ensure
constant pools of demand

  
As one of the largest
procurers for schools

  
hospitals and other government facilities

  
governments can use their budgets

  
to ensure that farmers
have constant marketplaces

  
in which to sell what they grow

  
It can be done as we've seen in Kenya

  
And then third

  
Farmers work together to support
your common interests

  
By jointly funding marketing campaigns
through industry bodies and cooperatives

  
farmers can promote what they grow

  
put money in their pockets
and ultimately change their lives

  
which is the end goal

  
Warning big warning
in case anyone was losing me

  
(Laughter)

  
Marketing can be a force for good
but it can go too far

  
especially if it's used to promote foods
that are full of fat salt and sugar

  
So what if in addition
to everything I've said

  
we not only use marketing to promote
foods grown by African farmers

  
but we use it to promote foods
that are more nutritious

  
and also better for the environment

  
If we do that

  
then we've got the triple play
of agriculture development

  
increased farmer livelihoods

  
more nutritious foods for consumers

  
and more sustainable agriculture

  
So I'll give one last example using rice

  
Rice is a staple crop

  
and in many countries it is consumed
as a large part of diets

  
However white rice in particular
is low in nutrients

  
it takes lots of water to grow

  
and current techniques for growing rice

  
are contributing to a lot
of greenhouse gas emissions

  
So what if we replace rice with millet

  
Millet is a grain just like rice

  
It is rich in fiber and antioxidants

  
It has more calcium than milk per serving

  
It takes  percent less water to grow

  
and it is drought and pestresistant

  
which is increasingly important
in today's world

  
Sounds like a good alternative right

  
Well there are lots
of other foods like this

  
that are both more nutritious

  
and more sustainable for the environment

  
such as pumpkin leaves sweet potatoes

  
lentils moringa and many others

  
So we need to promote these foods

  
develop tasty and affordable
recipes with them

  
and importantly
get celebrity chefs on board

  
Because at the end of the day

  
people need to want to eat these foods

  
not be told they have to

  
So I'll leave you with this

  
Africa is still relatively early
in its development trajectory

  
versus other markets

  
and it has the opportunity
to do things differently and better

  
By using marketing
and a demandled approach

  
Africa can boost economic growth

  
reduce incidences of dietrelated diseases

  
and adapt to the challenges
of climate change

  
Got millet

  
(Laughter and applause)

  
Thank you

  
It was Christmas time in Camelot 
and King Arthur was throwing a party

  
The entire court was invited—
save the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay—

  
and food and drink flowed freely

  
But in the midst of the revelry
the castle doors split open

  
A towering knight riding an emerald
steed burst into the room

  
stunning the court into silence

  
Then in a deep bellowing voice
he proposed a game

  
The Green Knight declared he would allow

  
the bravest warrior present to attack him
with his own axe

  
If they could strike him down 
they would win his powerful weapon

  
However the knight would be allowed
to return that blow

  
in one year and one day

  
Arthur and his knights were baffled

  
No man could survive such a strike

  
The Green Knight began to mock
their leader’s hesitance

  
and Arthur stood to defend his honor

  
But as soon as he gripped the axe
another leapt to take his place

  
Arthur’s nephew Sir Gawain
took the weapon instead

  
And with one swift strike he beheaded
the grinning knight

  
But the moment his skull met the ground
it began to laugh

  
The Green Knight collected his head 
and mounted his horse

  
As he rode off his severed head
reminded Gawain of their contract

  
and told him to seek the Green Chapel
one year hence

  
In the months that followed Gawain tried
to forget this bizarre vision

  
But despite the strangeness
of the knight’s game

  
he was determined to act honorably

  
When the following winter approached
he set out—

  
enduring foul weather 
and beastly encounters

  
in his quest to find 
the mysterious Green Chapel

  
Finally on Christmas Eve he saw 
a shimmering castle on the horizon

  
The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled
to help such an honorable guest

  
and informed him that the Green Chapel
was only a short ride away

  
They implored Gawain to rest at their home
until his meeting with the Green Knight

  
Thrilled at this news Gawain happily
accepted their offer

  
However in exchange 
for their hospitality

  
the lord made a strange request

  
Over the next three days he would go
hunting and share his spoils every night

  
In return Gawain must give him whatever
he’d gained during his day at the castle

  
At first Gawain was perplexed
by these strange terms

  
But the lord’s meaning became quite clear
the next day

  
when his wife tried to seduce Gawain

  
To rebuff the lady’s advances 
without offending her honor

  
Gawain allowed one kiss—

  
which he then passed on to her husband
in exchange for a slain dear

  
The next day Gawain allowed two kisses
which he gave to the lord for a dead boar

  
But on the third day the lady offered
more than just three kisses

  
She presented a magical sash 
that would protect Gawain

  
from the Green Knight’s blade

  
Gawain accepted immediately 
but that evening when the lord returned

  
the knight offered only three kisses 
with no mention of his enchanted gift

  
The next morning Gawain rode 
out to the Green Chapel—

  
a simple mound of earth

  
where the Green Knight 
ominously sharpened an axe

  
With the sash’s protection 
Gawain approached stoically—

  
determined to honor his agreement

  
He bowed his head for the deadly blow
and with a massive swing

  
the Green Knight cut Gawain’s neck—

  
inflicting nothing more
than a flesh wound

  
Once more Gawain was bewildered

  
Why hadn’t the sash protected him

  
And why hadn’t the knight 
killed him

  
Bursting into laughter the Green Knight 
revealed himself to be the castle’s lord

  
and he’d been working with Morgan Le Fay

  
to test the honor and bravery 
of Arthur’s knights

  
He was impressed with Gawain’s behavior

  
and he’d planned to spare 
his neck entirely—

  
until Gawain concealed the sash

  
Filled with shame 
Gawain returned to Camelot

  
But to his surprise 
his companions absolved him of blame

  
and celebrated his valor

  
Struggling to understand 
this strange journey

  
it seemed to Gawain that perhaps 
the whole world was playing a game—

  
with rules more wild and bewildering
than any man could understand

  
"How many times must a man look up

  
Before he can see the sky"

  
That's a quote from
a famous song by Bob Dylan

  
I love that line because it reminds me

  
that sometimes what we need is actually
right there in front of us

  
I will argue that that is also the case
with climate change

  
We can actually replace some
of the biggest sources of the problem

  
oil coal and gas

  
with something we have in abundance

  
wind

  
In my country Denmark
we are doing just that

  
Now we are a small country
with a small population

  
If you haven't visited yet please do so

  
We are all friendly people

  
As long as you don't criticize
our national football team

  
(Laughter)

  
Nothing makes a Dane proud

  
like the knowledge
that something we have done

  
makes a positive difference in the world

  
Historically speaking
we’ve made a difference before

  
 years ago countrymen of mine
controlled most of northern Europe

  
I'm sure you've heard of them

  
Big strong guys
helmets beards long hair

  
The Vikings

  
Now I will make the case today

  
that in order for us
to fight climate change

  
we actually need to learn
from the Vikings

  
But before we get to that
please indulge me

  
We have to go somewhere else

  
I have to say go back in time

  
Not all the way back to the Viking age
in the heydays of Harald "Bluetooth"

  
but to the s

  
during the oil crisis in Denmark

  
Not to a Viking fortress

  
but to a small workshop
in a barn in a farm

  
in a village in Denmark

  
Meets Henrik Stiesdal

  
He’s not an accomplished
experienced engineer

  
He's  years old a young man

  
He set himself a challenge

  
He thought

  
"What if I could make a wind turbine
that could produce electricity"

  
And you know what

  
He did

  
How do I know

  
Because that's it

  
Not a model not a replica

  
This is the actual one that Henrik made

  
He was kind enough to lend it to me

  
It says M on it

  
That stands for "mølle one"

  
"mølle et" which translates
into "turbine number one"

  
And of course this was just
the first one he made

  
Later he managed to build a big one

  
that could supply his family with cheap
affordable electricity

  
in the middle of the crisis

  
And soon after that

  
other farms asked Henrik
to build a turbine for them as well

  
And he did

  
And eventually he actually sold the design

  
to a company called Vestas

  
You might have heard of them

  
because they are the biggest
turbine producer in the world today

  
So this is how Henrik’s invention

  
became a sort of the prototype for many
many of the wind turbines

  
that you'll see all over the planet today

  
Now a lot of things have happened
since Henrik and other pioneers

  
took the first steps back in the s

  
In 

  
we built the first offshore wind farm
in the world called Vindeby

  
Eleven turbines  meters tall

  
That was considered a landmark

  
They were huge

  
Today of course they seem pretty tiny

  
This is Kriegers Flak

  
That's the biggest offshore
wind farm in Denmark now

  
 turbines

  
 meters tall each of them

  
To give you a comparison

  
that's twice the height
of the Statue of Liberty

  
Every time one of those turbines
has one rotation of the blades

  
it creates enough electricity
to charge more than  cell phones

  
The park itself covers the electricity
demand of  households

  
So the story of wind power in Denmark

  
is the story about how one turbine

  
on one farm

  
sparked a transformation
that influenced the whole country

  
We of course now hope

  
small as we may be

  
that we can spark a transformation
that will also affect other countries

  
We are a green frontrunner

  
but we need to do more
because at the same time

  
we rank number one in the EU

  
or at least as one of the biggest
oil producers in the EU

  
This has to change

  
And it will

  
Last year the Danish government
and the Danish parliament

  
made an important decision

  
We’ve decided to put an end date
on extraction of oil and gas in 

  
and immediately cancel
all future licensing rounds

  
(Applause)

  
That wasn't an easy decision

  
When we made the decision

  
we were the biggest
oil producer in the EU

  
But the reason we made it
even though it was expensive

  
was because we need to show the world

  
that there are actually
alternatives to oil and gas

  
Now some of you are probably thinking
that sounds very good

  
but how will you do it

  
What do you do the days
when the wind doesn't blow

  
And what about the parts of our energy
system that cannot be electrified

  
Surely you cannot fly a jet plane
without jet fuels

  
Surely you cannot sail
a big container ship without bunker oil

  
But actually you can

  
This is an electrolyzer

  
The photo is from a visit I paid
a factory in Denmark a few weeks ago

  
So it's not a prototype
it's not a model in a lab

  
It's a functioning machine
it's a commercial product

  
What does it do

  
It transforms electricity into hydrogen

  
And that friends
that's the game changer

  
Because it makes it possible for us

  
to solve two problems
we have with wind energy

  
One we can now store the energy
for when the wind is not blowing

  
And two

  
we can now decarbonize
parts of our energy system

  
that we couldn't decarbonize before

  
Because the hydrogen
can be transformed into green fuels

  
Imagine that

  
The wind in the North Sea is transformed
by a turbine into electricity

  
The electrolyzer transforms
that into hydrogen

  
and the hydrogen is then made
into green sustainable fuels

  
that we can use to sail our ships
and fly our planes

  
I know it sounds like science fiction
but actually it's just science

  
Now in order for us to do that
at a scale that we need

  
we will need a lot of renewable energy

  
We will need to massively expand
our offshore wind capacity

  
And in Denmark we're doing just that

  
A very important part of that strategy

  
is to build the world's
first energy island

  
This is a simulation
of what it may end up looking like

  
 kilometers out in the sea

  
the size of  football fields

  
the biggest infrastructure
investment in Danish history

  
We're changing literally
the map of our country

  
Hundreds of wind turbines around it

  
When fully scaled

  
it'll be able to generate
 gigawatts of green electricity

  
Now  gigawatts

  
that's enough to cover the demand
of  million households

  
That's far more than we need
in Denmark which is good news

  
because then we can use it
to make the hydrogen

  
to make the green fuels

  
and we can export it to other countries

  
and thereby help them decarbonize
their energy systems

  
Some of you are probably thinking

  
"What does this have to do
with the Vikings"

  
But do you know what it was
that made the Vikings so successful

  
How they managed to go to Greenland

  
How they managed to sail to America
 years before Christopher Columbus

  
Their secret

  
They exploited the wind

  
They put tremendous effort
into making efficient sails

  
and it took as a long time for them
to make a sail as it did to build a ship

  
and it was just as important

  
And that brings me to my main point

  
We need as the Vikings did
 years ago

  
to change the world by finding new
and more efficient ways

  
of exploiting the energy

  
This time with slightly
better haircuts 

  
(Laughter)

  
and the motivation that lies in the fact

  
that this may be our biggest chance

  
of making a positive difference
in fighting climate change

  
Now some people will probably tell you

  
that a small country
cannot make a big difference

  
I beg to differ

  
When a young man like Henrik

  
could make a difference
for a whole country

  
why not also believe
that a country like Denmark

  
can make a difference for a whole world

  
We can't do it alone but we can do a lot

  
By innovating

  
by creating new technology
and new solutions

  
by exploiting something
that is much bigger than ourselves

  
the forces of nature

  
If you ask the International
Energy Agency

  
they will tell you that offshore wind

  
has the potential to cover
the current electricity demand

  
of the entire world not once

  
not twice

  
 times

  
So when you go to Denmark

  
you’ll meet a Dane

  
After you have said something nice
about our football team

  
(Chuckles)

  
try and ask her

  
"How do you think we should solve
the climate crisis"

  
Chances are she will say

  
"The answer my friend
is literally blowing in the wind"

  
(Laughter)

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

Breast cancer is one of the leading
causes of cancer deaths globally

  
About one in eight US women
will develop invasive breast cancer

  
over the course of their lifetime

  
And globally millions of women
suffer from breast cancer every year

  
But it is quite treatable
if detected early

  
Right now actually
mammography is the gold standard

  
for breast cancer diagnosis

  
But mammography has a  percent chance
of missed detection

  
Thousands of lives could be lost each year

  
because of this  percent

  
Today I’m going to introduce
a new technology

  
photoacoustic imaging

  
As you can see

  
it provides a much clearer image

  
leading to a more accurate diagnosis

  
It will be affordable
just like an ultrasound scan

  
It's painless and fast

  
taking only  seconds
to scan the entire breast in D

  
And immediate results
will be delivered to the patients

  
Beyond breast imaging

  
this technology will broadly transform
how we see inside our bodies 

  
and maybe one day even allow us
to diagnose cancer

  
via a wearable watchlike device

  
that monitors circulating tumor cells

  
So what is photoacoustic imaging

  
Based on a photoacoustic effect

  
it is a conversion of light energy
into sound energy

  
We shot a gentle laser pulse
onto the tissue

  
The light is absorbed
raising its temperature a bit

  
The rise in temperature leads
to a tiny fraction of volume expansion

  
which in turn generates acoustic waves

  
Sensors process those sound signals

  
resulting in a highresolution image

  
whose level of clarity
and detail far surpasses

  
what you've got with traditional
CT scans or ultrasound

  
Now about me

  
I started out in industrial optics

  
but changed direction

  
after my grandparents died
of cancer and stroke

  
I realized that we needed
better imaging technology

  
to aid early diagnosis

  
and to provide a better
understanding of the diseases

  
So I decided to devote myself
to biomedical optical imaging

  
I now research and develop
next generation medical imaging

  
with applications ranging
from diagnosing cancer

  
to mapping brain functions

  
and navigating medical micro robots
for drug delivery

  
Here are some examples
showing what we can do

  
Take this mouse

  
The mouse has been virtually sliced
into  pieces from head to toe

  
It took only  seconds
to complete the whole body scan

  
It looks a little like a mouse carpaccio

  
(Laughter)

  
But don't worry no mice were hurt
during the imaging

  
(Laughter)

  
In this next video

  
we hold the animal another mouse
in position to image its liver

  
The liver has a lot
of blood vessels inside

  
You can see them as a treelike network

  
Because our imaging exposure time
is too short only  microseconds

  
there is no blur at all

  
despite the movement of the animal
during the imaging

  
The mouse is breathing normally

  
and every frame in our video is clear

  
With each slice we can clearly see
the internal structure

  
and the blood vessel network

  
This enables us to differentiate
a tumor from normal tissue

  
The light dose we use
is well below the safety limit

  
and we don't need to inject
any contrast agents

  
It is totally noninvasive

  
Now for an example
that is a little closer to home

  
This is a side by side comparison
of human brain images

  
On the left you see an image from an MRI

  
On the right from photoacoustic imaging

  
Photoacoustic imaging can reveal
detailed vasculature

  
but with even faster detection
of the brain functions

  
and without using
the costly highmagnetic field

  
What you are seeing here
is the brain's activity

  
where a patient now a human this time

  
taps his finger puckers his lips

  
taps his tongue and is listening
and thinking of words

  
Although I don't have a visual for it
I'd like to share one more example

  
In science fiction

  
micro robots enter our bodies
to cure diseases

  
in hardtoreach areas

  
However in reality

  
locating guiding and controlling them
inside of the body is a big challenge

  
Just like the satellites in space
guiding cars to their destinations

  
a photoacoustic imaging system
outside the body

  
can serve similarly as a GPS
for the micro robots

  
Biomedical optics has come a long way

  
The microscope used every day
in modern medical diagnosis

  
was invented in the th century

  
which revolutionized th century medicine
by letting us see into a cell

  
Then optical coherence tomography
developed in s

  
increased optical penetration
to  millimeter

  
bringing huge benefits to clinical care
for skin and eyes

  
Now photoacoustic imaging

  
first adopted for medical
use in the s

  
allows us to see even more

  
allowing penetration
by another order of magnitude

  
to several centimeters

  
allowing organlevel in vivo
human imaging

  
Photoacoustic imaging is a highlyactive
and a fastgrowing research field

  
Using microwaves instead of light

  
this imaging method holds promises
for whole body penetration in humans

  
in the future

  
We are hoping that the further
advancement of this technology

  
will aid early diagnosis of cancer
and brain diseases

  
ultimately benefiting global health

  
I hope you all can share my excitement
over this fastgrowing field

  
and hope you'll join us
in advancing the technology

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Whitney PenningtonRodgers Hi Nick 
thanks so much for being here

  
Nick Turner Whitney thank you

  
WPR For those who aren’t familiar

  
could you start by just telling us
a little bit about Vera

  
and the work you do

  
NT The Vera Institute of Justice
is a leading justice reform organization

  
We seek to transform the criminal legal
system and the immigration system

  
We call it the criminal legal system

  
because to call it
a criminal justice system

  
is a little bit of a misnomer

  
It doesn't deliver justice

  
And we work to transform
the immigration system

  
because many of the problems

  
that we see in the criminal legal system

  
are just the same
in the immigration system

  
And by transform

  
what I mean is to shrink
both of those systems

  
to make sure that they are less brutal
than they are right now

  
and that there's some modicum
of justice that's provided

  
We work on some of the biggest problems

  
that are facing the country
in these two realms

  
and try to provide solutions

  
So I'll just give you an example of that

  
One of the things
that we did over the last years

  
was to participate in a campaign

  
that ended up overturning
the congressionally imposed ban

  
on Pell Grants

  
which is federal financial aid
for lowincome students

  
 Congress said that those
were no longer going to be available

  
to incarcerated students

  
and we were able to win that back
at the end of 

  
And that makes a remarkable difference

  
to close to  people right now

  
who have an opportunity to earn a degree

  
find a pathway to employment
to higher income

  
to end intergenerational incarceration

  
and for people who are concerned
about it to save money

  
because there's less recidivism

  
WPR I know you do so much more
than just that but I mean

  
even thinking about the reason we need
this sort of thing in this country

  
and sort of how our justice system
ended up in this space

  
where this sort of work is even necessary

  
Maybe you could describe
a little bit about that

  
and how it plays
into the rest of the world

  
NT Well there's a little bit
of history to tell

  
I'm not a historian but I think
it's probably something

  
that all of you are familiar with

  
This system that we have
and the roots of it

  
they go down to our very bones

  
I often describe it as being
just as American as apple pie

  
The system of mass incarceration
that we have is just the latest iteration

  
the modern iteration of a system
of racial subordination in the country

  
And it manifests and has manifested
in different ways in America

  
But you can go back to slavery

  
you can go back to the th Amendment

  
which outlawed slavery except for people
who were convicted criminally

  
You can think about 
postReconstruction era  on

  
when the South

  
which didn't have a work force

  
because it was deprived
of enslaved people

  
passed laws Black Codes

  
that made criminal things
like standing on a corner

  
standing on a street called it loitering

  
And then people would be arrested

  
and then their bodies would be sold
to private industry

  
and leased as labor

  
So that was our first interaction
with mass incarceration in the country

  
And if you flash forward  years

  
and you rebegin the story
in the early s

  
that was our second
postReconstruction period where

  
in response to the gains that were made
in the civil rights movement

  
politicians sought to tap
into the frustrations

  
of many white voters

  
so that you talk about it sometimes
as the Southern Strategy

  
and started responding to disorder
that was seen in cities

  
and said "We need to have
a war on drugs"

  
"We need to have a war on crime"

  
And generation of toughoncrime laws

  
mandatory minimums were put in place

  
And that's what we have now

  
And we went on a sort of stratospheric

  
percent increase
in the prison population

  
over the course of the  years

  
between the early 's and the aughts

  
And here's the thing that we should know

  
is that we did it

  
This is a product of democracy

  
It did not have to be this way

  
but we elected people who promised us

  
that safety and order could be delivered

  
by a criminal legal system
that we have today

  
WPR Well thank you for that

  
I think it's interesting in thinking
about this moment right now

  
where I feel like there's so much
interest in this subject

  
and thinking about justice reform
and and how we can fix this system

  
And I'm curious to know from you

  
sort of your thoughts
about this moment right now

  
where it is in some ways kind of trendy
to support issues around criminal justice

  
NT I've been doing this work
for about  years

  
one way or another

  
in direct services at first

  
and then in the policy work that Vera does

  
and you know

  
I admit that I have seen
in the past five or six years

  
that this has become
sort of a cause célèbre

  
and people have gotten excited about it

  
I think that that is
a fundamentally good thing

  
If you remember
what I said a moment ago

  
that this is democracy
that created this monster that we have

  
and so the only way that we will undo it
is if people engage

  
And so the mere fact
that we have discussions

  
like the one that we're having tonight

  
that you can name a slew of celebrities

  
from Kim Kardashian to you know

  
to John Legend and sort of list goes on

  
who have elevated this issue

  
and made people start to think
about it differently

  
that we have a generation
of young people who have grown up

  
with the concept of mass incarceration

  
and understand it's actually not something
that is necessary to deliver safety

  
but in fact that there are all sorts
of profound costs and burdens

  
that are associated with it

  
So it may feel trendy

  
because for you know
up until five or six years ago

  
while many people carried
the stigma and the sadness

  
that one in two Americans
have a family member

  
who has been incarcerated 

  
that's massive one in two

  
This is what we've created

  
and a lot of people carry that stigma

  
and so that people
are finally talking about it

  
and calling attention to it
is absolutely necessary

  
So I'm OK if people are on trend

  
WPR And I'm curious if you feel

  
the pandemic in any way
has impacted your work

  
or the way that we all should be thinking
about justice reform

  
NT Well not enough

  
I mean I think one of the things
that happened when the pandemic started

  
was that we actually saw
a pretty remarkable reaction

  
on the parts of jail systems and police
where we recognize that you know

  
some of the most profound
vectors of COVID spread

  
were going to be
in congregate care facilities

  
That’s jails and prisons
around the country

  
And jail populations dropped
about  percent

  
because sheriffs
were letting go of people

  
judges were not imposing bail

  
police were issuing tickets

  
rather than arresting
and sending folks to jail

  
And so that was actually a very positive
sort of general reaction to see

  
We've seen those numbers
start to tick back up

  
so it didn't quite have the durability
that we would like it to

  
But one of the things

  
that I think we learned
at that moment in time

  
is that it actually
didn't cost people anything

  
Those decisions could be made

  
and people stayed safe

  
And there was a manifestation
that what mattered was you know

  
public health over public safety

  
And people’s humanity mattered

  
And so it was a remarkable thing to see

  
but we've got a lot more work to do

  
WPR And to that point I guess

  
what is the work that we have to do

  
What do you think we do
in this moment to fix this system

  
NT I think the most important
thing that we can do

  
is to redefine what we think
delivers safety

  
and safety for whom

  
So we have this pretty simplistic
notion in this country

  
We grow up talking about bad guys
and good guys cops and robbers

  
We brand people as criminal

  
for a certain act
that they have committed

  
as if that is the sum total
of who they are

  
But the formula that we
have basically been fed

  
and I think mostly have ingested

  
and tend to embrace as a people
is that if you want safety

  
you have to have police
and you have to have prosecutors

  
and you have to put people
in jail and prison

  
But the fact of the matter is

  
is that we as a country are quite unusual

  
in that we use this
this criminal legal system

  
to respond to an array of problems
and challenges that people have

  
that are really noncriminal

  
So I'll give you one statistic

  
Every year about  million people
are arrested in this country

  
So that's one every three seconds

  
So it just happened again

  
And it just happened again

  
And some people might be OK with that

  
and they think "Well you know

  
it's a violent country
there are a lot of guns out there"

  
But when you look at statistics
one of the things that we see

  
is that only five percent
of those arrests are for violent crime

  
An  percent   percent 

  
so we're talking eight million
of those arrests

  
which means people going to jail

  
getting a record that's going to make it
hard for them to get a job

  
are for conduct
that's associated with poverty

  
homelessness mental illness
and substance use

  
And so we're investing in this apparatus

  
that sucks people into the system

  
that isn't well adapted to address
these complex problems

  
because many of these things
are public health problems

  
Homelessness  we should have
supportive housing

  
Why would we lock someone up

  
If someone is decompensating

  
would we rather have two people
with side arms pop out of a car

  
and address that situation

  
or we'd rather have a trained person

  
who actually knows how to deescalate

  
and understands mental illness

  
and connect that person
to the right kind of system

  
So what we need to do

  
is invest less in this massive apparatus

  
and invest in the things that we know
will actually provide

  
the kind of safety and the thriving

  
and far less harm
than what we currently have

  
So it has to be a fundamental sort of
reordering of how we think about things

  
We have to be deprogrammed

  
And then we have to go out
and we have to act

  
and we have to vote on that

  
and we have to participate
in local elections

  
for district attorneys and sheriffs

  
and demand these kinds of changes

  
And demand from mayors and governors

  
that they invest in public health
and invest in communities

  
rather than in the systems
that end up harming them

  
WPR So what you're describing

  
is really this idea of decarceration
and defunding the police

  
which has gotten a lot of air time
in the past you know year or two

  
And I think there are definitely people

  
who think that this idea feels
either too pieinthesky

  
that it’s too far from where we are
right now as a nation to get there

  
And other people who maybe just feel

  
like this just isn't the right way
to go about fixing these issues

  
And so I'm curious
what you would say to skeptics

  
NT Well you know I mean

  
the first thing that I would recognize
is that you know 

  
so the language of defund is intentional
you know provocation

  
And it sort of sharpened the issue

  
And I think that in the political context

  
Democrats have been very effectively
trolled by Republicans

  
and have been tagged with the issue

  
But if you really stop and you look at it

  
if I were to talk to you and I say

  
look we're spending
 billion dollars a year on policing

  
In major cities in this country
we're spending  percent to  percent

  
sometimes  percent on policing
of a city budget

  
Not on housing

  
not on public health

  
not on substance abuse care
and not on mental health care

  
on policing

  
And by the way

  
 percent of the things
that the police are stopping people for

  
are for conduct that relates
to poverty and homelessness

  
and mental illness and substance use

  
Does that make sense to you

  
Is that how you want to spend dollars

  
Is that what you believe is the right
return on investment for societies

  
First of all I think it's important
you have to listen to people

  
And if they're fearful about crime

  
you've got to acknowledge
that that might be the case

  
And certainly in communities
where we've seen a lot of crime

  
people do have a right to be fearful

  
I come to this work

  
because of my commitment
to racial justice and equity

  
Others on the other side
of the aisle might not

  
They might come to it
for civil liberty reasons

  
that you know they want to shrink
the size of government

  
they don't like government overreach

  
they are concerned about how
government spends its money

  
So I think it's important to figure out
how to meet people where they're at

  
to have the conversation
that obviously requires listening first

  
And then the last thing that I'll say

  
is that I would urge people to do
exactly as we've done tonight

  
which is to recognize
the humanity of people

  
and to you know again

  
one in two Americans have had
a family member who was incarcerated

  
And so I know there are people
in this audience

  
who have experienced that

  
who have maybe stuffed it away

  
and are challenged by you know

  
coming to terms with that stigma

  
But for us to remember what we would like
for our sons and our daughters

  
or our brothers or our fathers

  
and to start from that perspective

  
So I would try to engage people
on a human empathetic level

  
WPR And just I guess
as a final thought here

  
Do you feel hopeful I guess
about this moment

  
Do you feel like we're moving
in the right direction

  
NT Most days

  
Most days I feel hopeful

  
I mean I talked about the deep roots
of this system that we have

  
and I talked about the fact

  
that this is something
that democracy chose

  
that we all chose

  
that we can unchoose it
and we can act differently

  
I think it will take a long time

  
I'm very hopeful again that we're having
the kinds of conversations

  
that we are having tonight

  
that people are engaging

  
I see movement on the policy level

  
but I'm also not tricked into believing
that it will be easy

  
And some of the same tools
that we have seen

  
that have created this apparatus 

  
the fear mongering

  
you know

  
sort of the iconography
of gang bangers and you know

  
cities of carnage and Willie Horton

  
and all of these sort of the things
that fueled this movement 

  
I see that again today

  
I see that on headlines

  
My motherinlaw visited for a while

  
she watched a lot of Fox News

  
I saw it  hours a day

  
And so that's dangerous

  
And so that makes me remember
what you know

  
what a task we have ahead of us

  
and how much we're really going to have
to lean in and to be resilient

  
to claim victories when we can

  
But to wake up the next day and know
that we're going to have to reach harder

  
and stronger to get more done

  
WPR Thank you so much Nick
you've given us a lot to think about

  
Thank you for being here tonight

  
NT Thank you Whitney it's a pleasure

  
(Applause)

  
What you want my milkshake Here

  
“It’s 

  
As the United States Congress prepares 
to make Missouri

  
the th state in the Union

  
Representative James Tallmage Jr 
delivers a speech

  
He says slavery is morally wrong

  
calling it an ‘abomination’
and a ‘monstrous scourge’

  
He insists that ‘the extension 
of the evil must now be prevented’

  
and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed 
in Missouri or any new state”

  
Obviously

  
“Representative Tyler disagrees

  
He believes it is a state’s right 
to choose whether or not to allow slavery

  
He doesn’t think the federal government
can prohibit slavery

  
in any newly added states”

  
Whaaaaat

  
“Senator Thomas proposes
what he sees as a compromise

  
Missouri will join the union along
with another state Maine

  
Slavery will be allowed in Missouri
and prohibited in Maine

  
He also suggests drawing a line 
through territories yet to become states

  
slavery will be prohibited north 
of the line and allowed south of it”

  
And this is where <iI</i have
to draw the line

  
That’s better

  
Now senators congressmen

  
this Missouri compromise you are proposing
is fundamentally flawed—

  
flawed is putting it mildly

  
The compromise is based 
on the middle ground fallacy

  
By saying that half of the new territories
should allow slavery

  
while half prohibit it

  
you position the two viewpoints
proslavery and antislavery

  
as equally valid

  
But if one view is wrong
while the other is right

  
a compromise between them is still wrong

  
And one side is definitely wrong here
the proslavery side

  
The whole reason this government exists

  
the whole reason states exist at all 
is to serve the people

  
That should include all people

  
Now I know there are those 
among you who would argue otherwise

  
even among those in favor
of ending slavery

  
In response to your many contorted
arguments all of them wrong

  
I offer this reminder

  
the idea that slavery 
is morally indefensible is not new to you

  
The founders of your country knew it
and many even acknowledged it publicly

  
even those of them who enslaved
other people themselves

  
It’s clear that the errors and delusions
on this subject

  
go far beyond the middle ground fallacy

  
but I call your attention 
to this particular fallacy

  
because it can have dire consequences
in many situations

  
Failure to recognize the fact 
that a compromise between two positions

  
one of which is morally indefensible
is also morally indefensible

  
has helped to perpetuate countless
injustices large and small

  
Even wellintentioned people—
which rest assured

  
I don’t mistake you for—
fall prey to this fallacy

  
because you humans tend to view compromise
as a virtue unto itself

  
“It’s March 

  
Seven states have seceded from the Union

  
since Abraham Lincoln 
was elected president

  
As Lincoln takes office with four more
states threatening to leave

  
he promises not to interfere with slavery
in states where it exists

  
but to prohibit its expansion 
into new territories and states”

  
“It’s April  and a Civil War
has broken out over slavery”

  
Some things can't be resolved
with a compromise

  
Seems like only yesterday
my mother said to me

  
"The ugliest thing in the world

  
is a naked man with socks on"

  
(Laughter)

  
Can you believe that was the first piece
of sex advice I ever received

  
(Laughter)

  
I was  years old growing up in Kenya

  
and I believe this might have been
my mother's way of trying to scare me

  
out of having intimate
relationships with men

  
It didn't

  
(Laughter)

  
Instead I became fascinated by sex

  
I wanted to hear
other people's stories about sex

  
and watch all the movies
with all the sex scenes

  
Everything about this very taboo subject
was so intriguing to me

  
Well now my mum's gone

  
Nine years this year

  
And true to her word

  
the ugliest thing in the world
is a naked man with socks on

  
(Laughter)

  
But over time I have found things
to be far much uglier

  
It took me a ton of therapy

  
to realize that my fixation with sex
was due to a traumatized childhood

  
See I was sexually assaulted
when I was eight years old

  
And I never told anybody

  
because even in my
comedicsexadvice household

  
I still didn't learn about consent

  
And I was afraid

  
Afraid that I would get into trouble

  
Afraid that it was my fault
or that nobody would believe me

  
Or worse still

  
afraid that my parents
would ground me forever

  
And I'm not alone

  
Men sexually assault women and girls
on a massive rate in Kenya

  
where  percent of women
aged between  and 

  
have reported either physical
or sexual violence

  
Actually only  percent
have reported sexual violence

  
And this is possibly
because most of this violence

  
happens in domestic partnerships

  
where the perpetrator
is known by the victim

  
And these patterns play out
all around the world

  
And I truly believe

  
that it's a lack
of sex education in schools

  
that is partially to blame

  
Back home

  
the education system is one
of destroying your relationship with self

  
shaming you for your discovery

  
and then praising you
for how much you conform

  
This coupled with disturbing
imagery of ailing genitals

  
is aimed at teaching us one thing

  
to abstain from all sexual activity

  
The perfect puritanical society

  
But of course young people
are still having sex

  
They just don't understand
the consequences

  
of their adultlike choices

  
This too was my experience

  
I had zero resources growing up

  
and unfortunately often found myself
in lessthanfavorable situations

  
as a teen and a young adult

  
Add on to that coming out as a queer woman
in a very homophobic country

  
My therapist once jokingly said
that I needed to pick a struggle

  
(Laughter)

  
All of this is to say

  
I really want to create a better
transition process for young people

  
because I truly believe
that the more we talk about sex

  
the safer and the better
it'll be for everybody

  
(Applause)

  
So in 

  
I started a sexpositive podcast
called "The Spread"

  
(Laughter)

  
Targeted at a panAfrican audience

  
I really wanted to create a safe space

  
where young people could openly talk
about different aspects of their sexuality

  
without feelings of shame or judgment

  
And it turns out
people love to talk about sex

  
(Laughter)

  
And I've had the great pleasure and honor

  
of answering a myriad of these questions
about sex on my podcast

  
such as "My boyfriend says

  
that if we have sex and it's my first time
and without a condom

  
that I won't get pregnant

  
Is this true"

  
Of course it's not true

  
Having sex without a condom poses
great risk of not only getting pregnant

  
but contracting STIs

  
Or “I watch too much porn

  
and I'm no longer aroused by my partner

  
Am I broken"

  
No you're not broken

  
But too much porn can desensitize you
from reallife pleasures

  
Or "I'm  years old

  
and my friends make fun of me
because I'm a virgin

  
Should I have sex
just to gain popularity"

  
Absolutely not

  
First of all virginity
is a social construct

  
And I think you should have
your sexual debut 

  
(Applause)

  
thank you 

  
when you’re good and ready to

  
A lot of the time we have a lot of fun
on the podcast honestly

  
But sometimes it does get
a little bit serious

  
especially when it comes
to one topic in particular

  
consent

  
These are some of the questions I receive

  
"My husband insists on having sex with me
even when I don't want to

  
I've relayed my concerns

  
He always responds with

  
'You're my wife
It's your place to do so'

  
How do I prevent this from happening"

  
Or "I went out last night
and woke up this morning

  
next to the guy that was chatting me up

  
I have no idea what happened
but I think we had sex

  
What should I do"

  
It's conversations like these

  
that reinforce the fact
that people don't have the first clue

  
how to talk about consent

  
So it's become my life's work

  
to create a curriculum
to educate young people on consent

  
Now the inspiration for this
might surprise you

  
but I got it in my s

  
after a visit to a BDSM dungeon

  
(Laughter)

  
For those of you that don't know

  
BDSM is a series of practices
and erotic role play

  
that involve bondage discipline

  
dominance and submission
and sadomasochism

  
Now I know a lot of people
have a lot of misleading information

  
about the BDSM community

  
but more often than not

  
we create and curate safe spaces

  
with an array of toys and items
for the kinky community to play with

  
if they so please

  
It's like a playground

  
For adults

  
(Laughter)

  
In BDSM everything is negotiated
before it happens

  
And these are some
of the rules and regulations

  
that would greet you upon entry

  
One

  
Do not touch anyone without asking

  
Even a hug

  
if you don't know somebody
is a bad move without permission

  
Two

  
Do not touch anyone's toys
without permission

  
If you're not sure
if something is a toy ask

  
Three

  
Consent can be withdrawn
at any time during an activity

  
And my personal favorite

  
if consent is not given

  
do not ask again

  
Accept and respect a "no"

  
as graciously as you would a "yes"

  
(Applause)

  
Now in no way am I interested
in teaching children BDSM

  
(Laughter)

  
But BDSM a community
that is created strictly for adults

  
that people view
as shameful and dangerous

  
has better guidelines
for learning about consent

  
than many homes or schools

  
in many parts of the world

  
And like you've heard
these rules aren't specifically sexual

  
but they can apply to sex

  
I truly think that the strategy

  
to raising adults
with healthy sexual behaviors

  
is to first teach kids about consent

  
like super early

  
way before sex is even a topic
of conversation

  
Can you imagine
having conversations with kids

  
and letting them know that everything
about their bodies can be negotiated

  
For example

  
let them decide who they want
to help them during bath time

  
Or tell them

  
that they don't have to accept
that kiss on the cheek from grandma

  
Or tell them that they
have to ask for a permission

  
before they play
with somebody else's toy truck

  
And let them know that they can say

  
"Actually my pronouns are they/them"

  
without feeling guilty

  
(Applause)

  
It's these tools that will help
keep our children safe

  
and respect people throughout their lives

  
We have the power to shape the future

  
The solutions are simple

  
It's the patriarchy
that's so damn difficult

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
So let's engage five
six or eightyearolds

  
on conversation around consent

  
and bodily autonomy

  
as a function of affirming their humanity

  
which in turn can look like adults
having safe healthy

  
pleasurable and fun sex

  
Because consent isn't just about sex

  
It's first about communication
and relationships

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Director Sound rolling

  
Take one mark

  
Katie McGinty We spend something
like  percent of our whole life indoors

  
It's everything from your own home

  
to companies and factories

  
We get married in those places
our children are born

  
some great scientist invents a cure
for disease in those buildings

  
But buildings are some bad news
for the climate

  
[In the Green The Business
of Climate Action]

  
[Presented by TED Countdown
and The Climate Pledge]

  
[Katie McGinty

[Sector Buildings
Location USA]

  
Buildings contribute about  percent
of global greenhouse gas emissions

  
They represent the biggest growing piece

  
of electricity consumption
and demand in the world

  
We're not cracking
this climate change challenge

  
unless we decarbonize those buildings

  
When you look at a building

  
there are key aspects of it
that enable it to run

  
It’s the heating and cooling;
it’s the lighting;

  
it's all of our appliances

  
All of those things together add up
to a very significant energy load

  
and a big cost

  
That's what we can go after

  
Replace the old HVAC

  
Get rid of the old incandescent lights
and add the new LEDs

  
Put in those windows
that have high efficiency

  
That's where digital smarts come in

  
where you can add sensors
in a building that say

  
“Hey nobody’s in this part
of the building

  
so let's ratchet back
that air conditioning

  
that’s otherwise blasting”

  
And don't worry about the upfront cost

  
Why

  
Because upgrading will generate savings

  
that now can be used to finance
the project in the first place

  
You're cutting    percent
of that energy bill

  
When organizations begin
to look at this journey

  
toward sustainability and netzero

  
a whole lot of unexpected promise
comes to the fore

  
The head of a public
housing authority for example

  
just wanted to cut some costs
but get into the effort

  
And here's what came to life

  
That the new community solar garden

  
became green energy efficiency tech jobs
for the local community

  
And that translated into something else

  
a sense of empowerment

  
ownership engagement by that community

  
and effort to bring cost down

  
lifted the entire community up

  
We're at a turning point

  
where piecemeal action
is catalyzing whole communities

  
to take action like never before

  
and they can do it on the basis
of the tangible examples

  
that prove the point

  
that climate action is actually
not only good for the environment

  
but it cuts costs and it creates jobs
at the same time

  
You know buildings
are pretty important in our lives

  
Buildings aren't just bricks and mortar

  
With technology and partnership

  
we can change those buildings
into flexible agile assets

  
and it is bringing us the opportunity

  
to tackle big issues like climate change

  
This summer I was visiting
family in England

  
There was a heat wave

  
It was hot and it was humid

  
There was very little breeze

  
The temperature was hovering 
around  degrees centigrade

  
for days on end

  
and the nights were not much better

  
In our little bungalow

  
there was nowhere to get cool

  
We had one fan moving hot air around

  
I was worried for my mom

  
Heat can send your heart rate
all the way up

  
The only place to get cool

  
the only relief

  
was at the supermarket in town

  
standing in front of the chiller cabinets

  
In  extreme heat has captured
the headlines on every continent

  
And globally in July

  
surface temperatures were the highest
recorded since records began in 

  
The problem is that the way
we cool things down

  
is heating the planet even more

  
Today’s airconditioning
is energy inefficient

  
depends on polluting refrigerants
such as hydrofluorocarbons

  
and many traditional
cooling technologies waste heat

  
I’m sure you’ve had that experience

  
of walking in an alley
behind a convenience store

  
and feeling that blast
of hot air on your face

  
coming from the chillers inside

  
And the demand for cooling is going up

  
The International Energy Agency
estimates that by 

  
today’s two billion air conditioners
will have multiplied

  
to more than  billion

  
and that by 

  
electricity demand for cooling buildings
could jump by  percent

  
And think about this

  
most households in hot countries

  
have not bought their first
air conditioner yet

  
I’ve worked on sustainable energy
for many years in different ways;

  
on energy access in the Sahel

  
to cold chains in East Africa

  
to financing largescale energy
infrastructure projects around the world

  
and to getting access to cooling
in lowincome communities

  
in the UK and the US

  
I've always focused on the twin problems
of sustainability and fairness

  
I think cooling gets at the heart
of these challenges

  
Why

  
Well because most wealthy
people can stay cool

  
They often live in wealthy leafy suburbs

  
with an air conditioner
and a generator out back

  
and they have cool offices

  
cool schools and hospitals

  
But many people on low income
live and work in urban concrete jungles

  
void of green space and shade

  
or live in rural areas well beyond
the cold chains needed for produce

  
and vaccines

  
Almost a billion people live
without energy access today;

  
billions more live without access
to reliable energy;

  
and  billion can only afford

  
a highly inefficient
or polluting air conditioner

  
These people’s quest
for sustainable energy

  
for cooling

  
for comfort

  
for cold chain

  
for a healthy diet or better health care

  
can drive a virtuous circle

  
where we can provide cooling for everyone
without warming the planet

  
Entrepreneurs with new technologies
are emerging everywhere

  
Framework agreements
guiding government action are in place

  
and there are big
and new commitments being made

  
The solutions go well beyond
just fixing airconditioning

  
The solutions range
from city design to architecture

  
from building materials to appliances

  
from geoengineering to green roofs

  
The solutions can be hightech

  
they can be lowtech

  
and there are four areas of promise

  
four areas where solutions
could be transformative

  
if we step up to the plate

  
prioritize regulate and invest

  
We’ll go through them one by one

  
First we need to build
and design differently for cooling

  
For the last  years or more

  
airconditioning has driven
building design

  
We need to change that

  
and we need to move away
from hermetically sealed concrete

  
and glass boxes where you can
switch on an air conditioner

  
but you cannot open the window

  
You know it doesn’t have to be
a window rattler as a solution

  
District cooling can provide
cooling solutions for building complexes

  
by running water through insulated pipes

  
And in Denmark

  
better known for its wind and its rain

  
district cooling provides

  
with a combination of heat pumps
wastewater and groundwater

  
cooling solutions for offices and homes

  
And we can make roofs cool too

  
The race is on for
the brightest whitest paint

  
that reflects  percent of sunlight
that hits its surface

  
much better than the 
to  percent we achieve today

  
And if not white then green

  
Green because they’re planted
with gardens and vegetables

  
also contributing to the food
that has to come from urban farming

  
Roofing materials matter too

  
In India modular roofing panels 
made from paper and waste wood

  
can reduce the temperatures
by up to  degrees centigrade

  
in the homes below

  
And we can change windows too

  
In the European Union

  
solar control glass is available
that provides high daylight transmission

  
thermal insulation

  
transparency

  
and low reflection

  
Second we need to make 
cooling hyperefficient

  
In the developed world

  
if you buy a highend
air conditioner today

  
it’s probably  to  percent
more efficient

  
than anything you could
have bought  years ago

  
Now we need every air conditioner
for sale everywhere

  
to be at least  percent more efficient
than the most efficient air conditioner

  
on the market today

  
It helps if we think
of energy efficiency as our first fuel

  
That’s not the priority
we give it in policy

  
We need much more of our economic activity

  
to be covered by energy
efficiency standards

  
that are much tougher than today’s

  
Radical efficiency
is important for heating too

  
Heating accounts for most
emissions from building

  
but emissions from cooling
are the fastest rising

  
So we need much more synergy
between heating and cooling

  
Remember the alley
behind the convenience store

  
Highefficiency energy pumps
will be solutions for both

  
Third

  
we need our airconditioning
to be hydrofluorocarbon or HFCfree

  
In  governments agreed
to phase down the production

  
and the consumption of polluting HFCs

  
a refrigerant that accelerates
global warming

  
That agreement the Kigali Amendment

  
is now ratified by  countries
and the European Union

  
including China

  
the largest producer of airconditioning

  
India

  
a growing producer and a big consumer

  
has agreed to follow suit

  
And while not a party to the agreement 

  
yet 

  
the United States announced
in September 

  
a new regulation that would insist

  
that US manufacturers reduce
HFCs by  percent

  
in the next  years

  
Now what’s interesting
is that there are existing

  
emissionsfree

  
nonpolluting technologies

  
on the market today

  
ready to go to scale

  
including membrane technologies
that can both cool and dehumidify air

  
without using compressors or refrigerants

  
So the Kigali Amendment

  
together with a ban on the exports
and imports of illegal HFCs

  
could make a real difference

  
and grow that market fast

  
And fourth we need cold chains
for food medicines 

  
especially vaccines 

  
for everyone

  
Distributing vaccines
along a secure cold chain

  
to reach the most vulnerable

  
is essential

  
Solar nontoxic vaccine refrigerators

  
cold boxes and carriers
operating on offgrid energy

  
are increasingly on order

  
And mobile cold storage units
that run on solar convert energy into ice

  
And so when the sun goes down

  
that ice can be used
to keep temperatures steady and cool

  
And using Bluetooth technology

  
even in areas where
there is no energy access

  
we can monitor all the way
along the cold chain to guarantee safety

  
And using drones

  
we can shorten the cold chain

  
Today change is often portrayed
as expensive or scary

  
but you can see
that there’s nothing scary

  
about living in a community
designed for cool

  
where affordable

  
efficient

  
nontoxic airconditioning 
and refrigerators run on clean energy

  
on and off the grid

  
and in a community
where farmers get more income

  
because more of their produce
gets to market

  
and everyone rests easier

  
knowing that their vaccines
are safely stored in the clinic 

  
a clinic which with a different roof

  
and different glass in the windows

  
is safer for the nurse to work in

  
What is scary is that we are not
having enough conversations

  
in enough places

  
and driving enough investments

  
into affordable nonpolluting
efficient solutions for cooling

  
for everyone on this warming planet

  
Scientists are seeing that animals

  
especially birds

  
are beginning to shapeshift
to adapt to climate change

  
As their environments get hotter 

  
so their ears are growing

  
and their beaks are growing
to help them cool down

  
Now our species is not shapeshifting yet

  
nor do I think bigger ears will help

  
(Laughter)

  
But we can shapeshift
our cities and our towns

  
and we can change the way
that we cool ourselves down

  
and we can change the way
that we keep our medicines and food safe

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
(Applause)

  
Have you ever bathed under a light
that creates the glow of a full moon

  
sculpted beaches into miniature mountains

  
or breathed in the aroma
of Earth’s first trees

  
These are some of the artworks I’ve made
to come to an understanding of deep time

  
But what is deep time

  
and why does it matter to us all

  
The term describes
the history of the Earth

  
over a time span of millions of years

  
My first encounter with deep time
came after I’d finished my studies

  
had no job

  
and didn’t know what to do

  
So I took off to work as a chambermaid
in the remote north of Iceland

  
I was tilted on my axis

  
and began a series of explorations

  
to try to figure out
how to tell the story of deep time

  
This has been the quest of my work

  
and it’s taken me through the cosmos

  
the geological strata of the Earth

  
to encounters with
the earliest forms of life

  
In Iceland I realized
that we live on a planet

  
By opening my eyes
to the primordial landscape

  
I started to understand
we’re not born out of nothing

  
The sea the sky the Earth the air

  
we’re made of the same stuff

  
we coexist

  
In just my lifetime

  
we humans have become a geological force

  
We’ve caused glaciers
around the world to melt entirely

  
I wanted to bring these distant landscapes
closer to our lives in a visceral way

  
So of course
I set up a phone line

  
People everywhere could dial a number

  
and listen live to the sound
of a glacier melting

  
(Ice cracks)

  
It was an elegy
to disappearing landscape

  
(Glacier melts)

  
Can we connect to deep time
via sensory experience

  
This artwork called “Totality”

  
brings together nearly every solar eclipse
documented by humankind

  
in a mirror ball

  
Over  images reflect
the progression of a solar eclipse

  
Their light surrounds us

  
and we can feel mesmerized

  
This led me to wonder

  
What is the color of deep time

  
I mapped the colors
of the entire universe

  
from its very beginnings
to its potential ends

  
discovering the pale blue hues
of the first stars

  
to the dark moons of the last light

  
Every single atom in our bodies was formed
in a star billions of years ago

  
The remnants of stars make up all of us

  
My vision was to gather
every dying star across the universe

  
and make a map

  
The result

  
over  supernova

  
stellar black holes

  
and gammaray bursts
shimmer as pinpoints of aluminum

  
What you see is a graveyard of stars

  
yet it alludes to life

  
The journey we humans have been on
to arrive right here

  
is nothing short of a miracle

  
“Fossil Necklace” is a string of worlds
made of the material of life itself

  
Each bead is carved from ancient fossils

  
and strung geological epoch by epoch

  
The beads chart major moments
in Earth’s history

  
The first singlecelled life

  
the first flowers

  
the first creatures to see

  
and to fly

  
“Fossil Necklace” speaks
to our long continuum

  
Every day we walk past trees

  
but do we stop to think
that they are our cousins

  
We share so many of our genes with trees

  
and forests give us our breath

  
I wanted to honor them

  
by creating a sculpture
made of every tree type on Earth

  
This is “Hollow”

  
Designed with architects Zeller &amp; Moye

  
it brings together
over  tree species

  
spanning millions of years

  
We were donated wood samples
from almost every country

  
the Indian Banyan

  
the White Mulberry

  
the Dawn Redwood

  
and twigs from sacred forests around us

  
Looking upwards into the light

  
we see the most threatened
tree species of now

  
More recently in my practice

  
I’ve come to believe that looking forward
is just as important as looking back

  
How do we speak to unborn people

  
How do we build a bridge across time

  
I thought the world's literary voices
may be the best at doing that job

  
so I proposed a library of the future

  
a forest

  
a room

  
 authors and  years

  
It started in 

  
On the outskirts of Oslo

  
we planted a thousand baby Spruce trees

  
When they’re fully grown

  
they’re going to be cut
and made into paper

  
Every year for  years

  
a different author is invited
to write something new

  
Their words will become
an anthology of books

  
printed on paper made from these trees

  
only to be read in the year 

  
The core of Future Library
is time and longevity

  
but also hope and rituals

  
Every spring we take
a pilgrimage to the forest

  
Authors hand over their manuscript
and announce its title

  
Their text will be stored here
in Oslo’s new library

  
You take off your shoes

  
you step inside

  
Each glass drawer holds a manuscript

  
 years is not vast in cosmic terms

  
Yet if my young son
lives to read the books

  
his world is likely to have changed
beyond recognition

  
Will human beings survive
to read the books

  
Future Library is a centurylong prayer

  
Future generations
may be invisible to our eyes

  
but we are connected through our actions

  
I wanted to see to future readers

  
“I see you”

  
“We see you”

  
Why does connecting to deep time
matter to us all

  
Shortsightedness may be the greatest
threat to humanity

  
To be human is to understand
that we’re part of a long continuum

  
Let’s embrace our cosmic context

  
respect our origins

  
and hold our future close

  
Thank you

  
As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica

  
children flock to Mr Kwaku for a story

  
They all know he’s full of tales 
from Ghana the land of their ancestors

  
But what they don’t know Kwaku winks

  
is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place

  
Long ago all stories belonged to Nyame
the allseeing Sky God

  
People on Earth were bored 
and knew nothing about their history

  
But one creature decided
enough was enough

  
Anansi the tricky shapeshifting spider

  
resolved to bring the stories
down to Earth

  
He spun a web that stretched 
into the clouds

  
and climbed up to confront the Sky God

  
Crouching at Nyame’s feet
Anansi shouted at the top of his lungs

  
that he had come to take ownership 
of the world’s stories

  
Looking down from his golden stool

  
Nyame hooted with laughter 
at the spider’s absurd request

  
Nyame told Anansi that he could have
all the stories he wished—

  
but only if he could complete
an impossible task

  
If Anansi brought him 
Osebo the Leopard Onini the Python

  
Mmoboro the Hornet 
and Mmoatia the Forest Spirit

  
then he could take the stories

  
Anansi humbly accepted

  
Nyame didn’t see him grinning 
as he scuttled away

  
Back on Earth Anansi grabbed 
his magic bag and set to work

  
Anansi found Onini the Python
bathing in the sun

  
Anansi scoffed that Onini 
couldn’t be the longest animal

  
saying he looked no longer 
than a piece of bamboo cane

  
Enraged Onini stretched himself across
the bamboo to prove his lengthiness

  
Anansi quickly bound him tighttight 
to each end and placed him in his bag

  
Next Anansi dug a great pit 
in the middle of the path

  
Osebo the Leopard usually prowled
and covered it with banana leaves

  
Sure enough mighty Osebo soon fell in

  
Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness
but offered to rescue him

  
As he helped Osebo out of the pit
Anansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife

  
Osebo fell back to the ground

  
where Anansi wound him up
tighttight in spider thread

  
Then Anansi heard Mmoboro 
and his hornets buzzing

  
He cautiously approached them

  
This would be tricky— their stings 
could make someone swell up and die—

  
but Anansi knew they hated rain

  
He filled his mouth with water 
and spat it at the swarm

  
As they panicked Anansi urged the hornets
to shelter in his gourd

  
where they found themselves trapped

  
Anansi had one more task
to capture Mmoatia

  
the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit

  
She usually hid herself deep in the woods
but Anansi knew she was lonely

  
So he made a little doll covered in sap
and left it in her path

  
When she came upon it 
Mmoatia spoke to the doll

  
but became enraged when it didn’t answer

  
She hit the disrespectful doll

  
and her small fists stuck 
to its sticky surface

  
Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tighttight 
and scooped her into his bag

  
along with the other creatures

  
Triumphantly he climbed his web
back into the clouds

  
When the Sky God saw that Anansi 
had completed the impossible task

  
he was amazed

  
Nyame told Anansi 
that he had earned the world’s stories

  
Dancing for joy Anansi gathered them up
stuffed the stories into his bag

  
and descended to Earth

  
There he scattered the stories 
throughout the world for people to share

  
And they did Kwaku tells the children

  
Generations have continued
telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories

  
even after being stolen from Africa
and enslaved

  
Anansi may be small but “cunning’s
better than strong” Kwaku says

  
and tells the children to take Anansi’s 
stories with them wherever they go

  
Looking at his audience Kwaku knows
that Anansi will persist

  
as a symbol of resourcefulness 
and resistance in the face of oppression

  
and a testament to the enduring power
of storytelling

  
Listen I'm worried about our democracy

  
Nowadays we have leaders who use
division itself as a political tool

  
They downplay

  
or even encourage in some cases

  
a deadly assault to overturn an election

  
And a bunch of them are working
really hard to make it harder to vote

  
The retreat from these processes
of democracy

  
you know ballot access
legislative debate judicial review

  
they are worrisome enough

  
But what's even more concerning to me

  
is the retreat from
the purposes of democracy

  
These oldfashioned notions
of government of by and for the people

  
The rule of law as superior
to the rule of any one personality

  
Liberty and justice for all

  
COVID made it harder
to overlook deep disparities among us

  
in health and wealth and education

  
and deep unfairness
in too much of our policing

  
leaving a lot of Americans questioning

  
whether our national commitment
to social and economic justice is real

  
For some time now
in the words of one friend of mine

  
the selfevident truth

  
that all people deserve life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness

  
seems a long way from settled
in the American mind

  
So to me American democracy

  
the supposed model of the form

  
Is up for grabs

  
I'm worried not just as a lawyer
or a former public official

  
but also and mainly as a patriot

  
I grew up on the south side of Chicago

  
in a crowded twobedroom tenement

  
with my mother my sister my grandparents
and various relatives who came and went

  
I went to big overcrowded
underresourced

  
sometimes violent public schools

  
And yet my grandmother
would never permit us to say we were poor

  
Just broke she'd say
because broke is temporary

  
Think about it Here is this refugee
from the Jim Crow South

  
who still believed in an America

  
where with hard work
preparation and faith

  
both religious and civic

  
you could lift yourself
from your circumstances of birth

  
I am for her the result and the symbol
of her faith in America

  
so you better believe I'm a patriot

  
But patriotism
for Black Americans is tricky

  
It's tricky to love a country
that doesn't always love you back

  
I think of the Black men who set off
to fight for freedom in the world wars

  
and then came home
to be denied those very freedoms

  
Some of them lynched
while wearing their military uniforms

  
I think of the Black laborers
who built great public universities

  
whose doors were closed to them

  
The Black voters
who elected great public leaders

  
whose policies like the GI Bill
were closed to them

  
For a lot of our history

  
American democracy itself
has been closed to Black people

  
Lots of grandmothers like mine

  
have grandsons and granddaughters
who never had their chance

  
Still don't

  
I remember in college

  
a white classmate asked me
"Why on earth would you want to be Black"

  
When I told her I hadn't
considered the alternative 

  
(Laughter)

  
and never would

  
she seemed startled and confused

  
I attribute this in part to the fact
that I spoke and dressed like a preppy

  
I get that part

  
But mostly I think she was confused
because she couldn't imagine

  
why any Black person
in his or her right mind

  
wouldn't trade places with her

  
I think it would blow her mind
as it may some of yours

  
when I say I am also proud
to be a patriot

  
Given our history
being Black and patriotic

  
will certainly
strike some people as strange

  
if not absurd

  
I don't know when patriotism turned into

  
you know lapel pins and flyovers

  
and silly arguments
about pro football players taking a knee

  
My love of country
is about national aspiration

  
America is the only nation
in human history

  
organized not by geography
or a common culture

  
or language or religion or even race

  
but by a handful of civic ideals

  
And we've come to define those ideals
over time and through struggle

  
as equality opportunity and fair play

  
Why Because that's
what makes freedom possible

  
That's the America
my grandmother believed in

  
That's the America that
has made us a magnet to talent

  
from all over the world

  
That's the America that makes me
and countless other men and women

  
from every race and background a patriot

  
In a way the founders
for all their flaws

  
designed America to be a nation of values

  
a sort of a country with a conscience

  
And we’ve struggled with and against
that conscience from the start

  
But true patriots understand
given that context

  
that America cannot be great
without also being good

  
So when we cage refugee children

  
to discourage their parents
from seeking sanctuary here

  
true patriots know we cannot be great
without being good

  
When bullets fly in houses of worship
or in schools or in nightclubs

  
or in grocery stores

  
and our leaders choose
the slogans of the gun lobby

  
over the lives of innocents

  
patriots know we cannot be great
without being good

  
When unarmed Black and brown citizens
are shot down by unaccountable police

  
when our justice system
is not yet consistently just

  
patriots know we cannot be great
without being good

  
When the economy moves on
and leaves broken lives

  
and broken expectations behind it

  
and our leaders just shrug

  
or when the public schools
continue to fail poor children

  
and when we can always find the money

  
for a weapons system
the military doesn't want

  
but not the money for the health care
a young family or senior needs

  
patriots know or must ask themselves

  
Can we be great without being good

  
And when we choose
a power grab over a fair vote 

  
every true patriot knows
we cannot be great without being good

  
Patriotism demands more
than ceremony and sanctimony

  
It's about more
than what you say you believe

  
it's about living the values
of equality opportunity and fair play

  
Even when it's inconvenient

  
even when it gets in the way
of partisan advantage

  
even when it compels us
to be mindful of and compassionate

  
towards the lowly the vulnerable
the different and the despised

  
Because that’s what
American democracy is for

  
Of course we have policies to fix

  
whether in job growth or education
in immigration or the justice system

  
or in these processes of democracy itself

  
But before we can fix our policies
we have to fix our politics

  
And by that I am not
just talking about better tone

  
or hyperpartisanship
or a willingness to compromise

  
As important as all of that is
I'm talking about our purpose

  
Sure we should debate and we always do

  
what role government should play
in any of this

  
in meeting our civic obligations

  
But let's try for once not to forget
in the heat of the debate

  
that social and economic justice
was the point from the start

  
But I think saving our democracy
will take more

  
not just from elected officials
or civic leaders or the media

  
but more from each one of us

  
And we're going to have to start I think
by putting our cynicism down

  
I'm going to give you an example
of what I mean

  
Near the end of my time in office

  
America faced a crisis not unlike today's

  
when there were all these
unaccompanied children

  
some as young as three and four years old

  
who were flooding
across the southern border

  
having fled over thousands of miles
from violence in Central America

  
And then just like now
the federal authorities were overwhelmed

  
So President Obama
who was in office at the time

  
called on a number of states

  
to temporarily shelter and care
for some of these children

  
while they were being processed
under our laws

  
Feelings around immigration
ran hot then just like now

  
Even so I agreed
that our Commonwealth would help

  
because sheltering poor children
fleeing unspeakable violence

  
was to me an act of patriotism

  
America has given sanctuary
to desperate children

  
for more than a century

  
We rescued Irish children from famine

  
Russian and Ukrainian children
from religious persecution

  
Cambodian children from genocide

  
Haitian children from earthquakes

  
Sudanese children from civil war

  
our own New Orleans children
from Hurricane Katrina

  
Once in  we turned our backs
on Jewish children fleeing the Nazis

  
And it remains a blight
on our national reputation

  
as I fear the separation of children

  
in the last administration
will be remembered

  
The point is that our esteem
and our power is enhanced

  
when we rescue the desperate 

  
and diminished when we don't

  
Still I'm not naive

  
I knew my decision would be controversial

  
and indeed for that decision

  
I was called on hate radio
and in social media

  
everything but a child of God

  
A couple of days
after I announced my decision

  
on an unusually quiet Saturday morning

  
my wife Diane gave me a list of stuff
to go get at the Home Depot

  
proving for some of you who know her
that there is no office high enough

  
that excuses you
from one of her honeydo lists

  
(Laughter)

  
It was early in the day

  
and I thought I'd just slip out quickly
you know on my own

  
without bothering my security detail

  
What harm could come of that right

  
I knew exactly where I was going
and where to find everything on my list

  
So I set off in the truck
in a Tshirt and jeans and flipflops

  
dark glasses and a baseball cap

  
And it didn't matter

  
I was outed by the manager
in the very first aisle

  
“Good morning governor!

  
Welcome to the Home Depot
How can I help you"

  
I encountered a man in the checkout line
who was redhot mad

  
You know not hostile or threatening
just really angry and loud

  
and he let me have it

  
"Governor" he said

  
"I couldn't disagree with you more
about your decision" he said

  
"My own wife is an immigrant
She came here legally

  
That's the way it ought to be

  
And I just want you to know
I think you're wrong"

  
Now in that circumstance

  
there was no point
in trying to engage with him

  
about how being a refugee
is legal under American law

  
I just thanked him for his feedback

  
But everybody in the checkout line
and in that area of the store

  
knew who was mad at whom
and what he was mad about

  
Now I had six other encounters
in the store on the same subject

  
And in every one of those
someone came up and whispered

  
"Governor you're doing the right thing"

  
"Governor thanks for looking out
for those kids"

  
"Governor I'm with you"

  
The calls to the office
were two and three to one

  
in favor of sheltering those children

  
And when I reflect on that
I think to myself

  
When did we learn

  
to shout our anger
and to whisper our kindness

  
It's completely upside down

  
I don't know if that's
the reality TV culture we live in or what

  
but it's totally backwards

  
It's time we learned again
to shout kindness to shout compassion

  
to shout justice

  
That's the purpose of American democracy
and the source of our greatness

  
Blessedly we're starting to see

  
more and more expressions
of this kind of thing across this country

  
More and more people
coming off the sidelines

  
overcoming their cynicism and fatalism

  
and standing up for America
at her generous and optimistic best

  
From women who are demanding to be treated

  
with the respect and decency
everyone deserves

  
From survivors
of domestic violence and abuse

  
demanding to be seen
and heard and believed

  
From Black and brown people who are
demanding consistent professionalism

  
and the presumption
of innocence from police

  
From students who are demanding
we choose their lives and safety

  
over the proliferation
of military weapons in civilian hands

  
From all those lawyers

  
who showed up at polling places
in  or at airports

  
after the socalled Muslim ban

  
demanding respect for the rule of law

  
Black Lives Matter Time's Up
Black Girl Magic Occupy Wall Street

  
Families Belong Together

  
At any given time on any given issue

  
they may make any one of us uncomfortable

  
But they have taken to the legislatures
to the ballot boxes

  
to the courtrooms
and peacefully to the streets

  
to lay claim to their democracy

  
its purpose as well as its processes

  
and ultimately to affirm
the American conscience

  
They are shouting kindness

  
If Americanstyle democracy
is to have a chance

  
more of us had better
put our own cynicism down

  
summon up our own patriotism

  
and join them

  
Thank you very much

  
(Applause)

  
Rha Goddess We are
in a moment of reckoning

  
An epic global plague

  
a massive workforce peaceout

  
and a worldwide racial awakening

  
have revealed that current
corporate structures

  
are not living up
to evolving expectations

  
Work is just not working for most of us

  
especially when it comes
to women of color

  
And while there can be no question
that the last two years have harmed us

  
it's also encouraged us to rethink how
where and why we work

  
We have an opportunity to reimagine

  
and women of color are ready
to share and to lead

  
We want to bring the world of work
into the st century

  
so that it works for everybody

  
And that starts with getting real

  
Our data shows that one in three women
are considering leaving the workforce

  
in the next year

  
Deepa Purushothaman One in three

  
RG And when we consider

  
all of the backs and shoulders
that we've stood on to get here

  
corporate America

  
women of color allies

  
are y'all ready for us to leave

  
When it comes to the world of work

  
I describe Deepa and I
as corporate refugees

  
Thirty years ago

  
I was an only

  
a Black woman in the specialty
chemicals industry

  
working for a Fortune  company

  
Now back in those days company cultures
didn't talk about race

  
and glass ceilings
were often impenetrable

  
even to the toughest set of stilettos

  
I got that memo early so I left

  
And for the last  years

  
I've dedicated my life
to supporting courageous leaders

  
As a coach

  
I help them pursue
their purpose and callings

  
in service to a more just
harmonious and sustainable world

  
DP Rha she calls as corporate refugees

  
I spent  years rising
in corporate America

  
and I got my seat at the table

  
I was the first Indian American woman
to do so in my global firm

  
and I sat on senior committees

  
influenced policy

  
and led large parts
of inclusion programming

  
I had a successful career

  
and I was on an upward trajectory
when I decided to walk away from it all

  
Why

  
I was stressed

  
I was chronically ill

  
and I was questioning
my larger purpose in the world

  
I knew I wanted to leave

  
but I felt responsible to the women
of color coming up after me

  
I met Rha

  
she changed my life

  
and she became my coach

  
And together we started
gathering women of color

  
To figure out if I should stay
or if I should go

  
What we learned from these women

  
was that their struggles
were not personal

  
The system is broken

  
And we decided we would work
together to learn more

  
And now we've started
a movement to change it

  
RG Since  Deepa and I
have interviewed thousands of women

  
and about six months ago we launched
a datadriven research project

  
to hear from over  women
from all backgrounds

  
about their work experiences

  
We wanted to have the data
to support the stories we were hearing

  
from all of the women we met

  
So much of the research
that we see out there

  
around women of color

  
talks about us in the third person

  
We wanted to do something
that enabled us to speak for ourselves

  
Some of the questions
we asked in the research were

  
“How does race
show up at work for you”

  
"Has your company created a clear plan
to support your advancement"

  
"Who or what has been most
instrumental to your success"

  
The results and the response
have been startling

  
DP The system was not created
for women of color

  
It doesn't show up
in the same ways for us

  
And we all need to let go of the idea
that it's a meritocracy

  
People everywhere are talking
about being burnt out

  
But women of color
we're not just burnt out

  
We're traumatized

  
The weight of microaggressions

  
racism and hatred at work

  
it takes a toll on us

  
And it takes a toll on our companies

  
We need to talk about that

  
Our research showed that the path
for women of color is very different

  
It shows up differently for us
as I said before

  
And what we saw was first

  
that women of color face many more
negative stereotypes in the workplace

  
Secondly we have to prove
ourselves more often

  
Seventy percent
of the women of color we met

  
said they have to prove themselves over 

  
RG And over

  
DP And over and over again

  
We get paid less

  
We get promoted less

  
And we also get hired less often

  
And when we do the right thing
and speak up about racism at work

  
what we find is the system turns on us

  
We're actually retaliated against

  
and very often traumatized yet again

  
We also heard from women of color
that DE and I isn't working

  
in fact it's failing

  
So there is a lot that has to change

  
So that's the bad news

  
But we do have some good news for you

  
The good news is
we have some ideas for you

  
We have some recommendations

  
And some of those things
you can do right now

  
to make the workplace work better
for women of color

  
And as a result make it
work better for all of us

  
One of the things our research identified

  
is that you and when I say you
I mean companies and leaders

  
need to do a better job
of dealing with toxic rock stars

  
You know that guy puts up big numbers
on the board sells big deals

  
clients love him bosses love him but 

  
RG He's a hot mess everywhere else

  
(Laughter)

  
DP You know that guy

  
We have them everywhere

  
They're in every workplace

  
Well we're asking you
to take action against them

  
When you don't what it tells us

  
is that performance trumps character

  
And when you leave them in seats of power

  
what you're telling us

  
is that profits matter more than people

  
It's time we humanize work

  
And that you care
about our wellbeing too

  
RG Another important takeaway
from the research is that women of color

  
are corporate America’s greatest
underutilized resource

  
and yet we could be your greatest
competitive advantage

  
We understand diversity

  
because we've had to navigate a world
that never had our success in mind

  
We are inherently culturally competent
because we've had to be

  
And our lived experiences
make us naturalborn leaders

  
Imagine what it's like to be
the first in your family

  
to make a start in a new country

  
or to be one of a few
to raise three kids as a single parent

  
while you work and go to school

  
Or to be an only in executive leadership

  
in a company that employs thousands

  
Women of color have had to overcome
so much just to be in the running

  
and we've been successful
because of these experiences

  
not in spite of

  
Corporations we are your innovators

  
Give us opportunities to lead
beyond DE and I

  
in product development marketing

  
finance and engineering

  
Go beyond your usual suspects

  
Take the time to see us

  
and learn about our unique qualities
and lived experiences

  
We are your truth tellers baby

  
(Deepa laughs)

  
in a moment where it's time
to tell the truth

  
If work environments don't get better

  
we will continue to leave

  
Take the time to reexamine
your company values

  
then get in touch with the daytoday
realities of your people

  
DP One of the truths
we also need to talk about

  
is as women we're not helping each other

  
I know that's a taboo topic to talk about

  
but we need to talk about it
if we're going to change it

  
Women we speak with
when they tell us that

  
their voices drop
and you can feel the shame

  
because it's so hard
to talk about the fact

  
that we don't help each other

  
More than half of the women
of color we spoke with

  
said that white women
make them feel invisible at work

  
And only nine percent
of the white women we interviewed

  
are actually sponsoring a woman of color

  
even though  percent of you
say you want to

  
Nine vs 
that’s a significant difference

  
So we're not doing as much
as we can for each other

  
and maybe not even as much
as we intend to

  
We need to change that

  
RG We also need to talk about power

  
and the traditional notions of hierarchy

  
we've all been taught to emulate

  
We've bought into the belief
that a gain for one

  
means a loss for another

  
And even if we truly don't believe that

  
we're under immense pressure to conform

  
because most workplaces operate that way

  
As women we tell ourselves
with the best intentions

  
"Let's just make it to the top

  
and then once we get there

  
we'll turn around and create
opportunities for others"

  
The problem is

  
so many of us never seem to get there

  
and when we do

  
we become allconsumed
with maintaining our seat

  
One woman of color
we spoke to in the research

  
gave us our greatest "drop the mic" moment

  
when she said

  
"We're competing with other women
for a seat at the table

  
And there’s only one brokeass chair”

  
And that's the problem

  
The designation of one seat

  
makes it feel more like charity

  
than an actual recognition
of our dedication and hardwon results

  
And we see all women grappling with this

  
Not just women of color

  
To our white sisters

  
it's time to become true coconspirators

  
because this affects all of us

  
(Applause)

  
We can create more room

  
We can do this differently

  
Let's not just talk about it

  
let's be about it

  
Billie Jean King is phenomenal at this

  
She has been a champion of equity
on and off the court for over  years

  
mever settling for anybody’s
brokeass anything

  
(Laughter)

  
Our collaboration with Billie Jean
and the Leadership Initiative

  
on this research

  
is yet another example

  
You know there used to be a saying
“Be more like Mike”

  
Well my sisters we are asking you

  
(Both) to be more like Billie

  
DP Women of color
I want to speak to you now

  
We need to reimagine power
and leadership in our own terms

  
We need to know
that we can do it our own way

  
We need to let go of the idea
that success comes on certain terms

  
and not forgive or forgo our hair

  
our history or where we come from

  
We need to know that we can lead
in full voice in cultures that see us

  
and reward us

  
and give ourselves permission
to walk away from the ones that don't

  
And we need to take
good care of ourselves

  
And remember not to go this alone

  
this is hard and we need our sisters

  
And we told you early on
this was about getting real

  
Well I want us to get real
with ourselves too

  
Rha and I we know we're not a monolith

  
that women of color
have different histories

  
and different paths to get here
and we recognize that

  
But we need to work together
to change the status quo

  
As we rise we need
to take others with us

  
We have to do this together
and let go of the idea of one seat

  
This has to be a collective effort

  
We don't just want more power
in the same broken system

  
we want more

  
The last few years have served us
some sobering truths about the workplace

  
But they've also given us
a chance to reimagine

  
Women of color are tired

  
RG Aren’t you tired too

  
DP This is our moment
to make work work for everyone

  
Let's remake the table together

  
Thank you

  
RG Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
The animal kingdom boasts 
an incredible diversity of eyes

  
Some rotate independently while others
have squigglyshaped pupils

  
Some have protective lids
others squirt blood

  
But which creature has the best sight

  
Which sees best in the darkness

  
Which sees the most detail

  
Which animal sees the most color

  
And finally 
which detects motion the fastest

  
All eyes take in sensory stimuli
in the form of waves of light

  
To convert these into everything we see

  
eyes focus incoming light
onto photoreceptors

  
These cells translate light 
into neural signals

  
and send them to the brain 
where they’re finally processed

  
The eyes that see best in darkness
are those that capture

  
as much available light as possible

  
Colossal squids have 
soccerballsized eyes—

  
the largest known in existence

  
These may help them spot 
the faint glow of sperm whales

  
as they disturb lightproducing organisms

  
Some fish have eyes that are unique among
vertebrates because they use mirrors

  
For the brownsnout spookfish

  
each eye has an upwardfacing lens 
and a downwardpointing mirror

  
composed of tiny crystal plates 
that efficiently gather light

  
They can see up and down simultaneously

  
and may perceive distinct shapes 
even in the ocean’s depths

  
Back on solid ground 
arctic reindeer have adaptations

  
to deal with months of darkness

  
The backs of reindeer eyes change color
from gold in summer to blue in winter

  
Their bluebacked eyes are about 
 times more sensitive to light

  
This may allow reindeer to recognize
important things in the snow

  
like urine and lichen

  
When it comes to the sharpest vision
birds of prey soar above the competition

  
To capture the most detail an animal must
have lots of photoreceptors in its eye

  
as well as increased 
visual processing power

  
Raptors have an especially deep fovea—

  
a depression in the back of their eye
that fits more photoreceptors

  
So Peregrine falcons have vision that’s
more than twice as sharp as a human’s

  
They’re able to zero in on a rabbit 
from more than three kilometers away

  
When crowning the creature 
with the best color vision

  
the picture gets complicated

  
Different photoreceptors are sensitive
to specific waves of light

  
meaning the colors we see 
are largely determined

  
by what kinds of photoreceptors we have

  
Presumably the more types of color 
photoreceptors an animal has

  
the better its color vision

  
Dogs have just two types

  
Humans have three

  
And we are far outdone
by some birds fishes and insects

  
Bluebottle butterflies have at least
 types of photoreceptors

  
Seven of them are attuned 
to distinct blues and greens

  
which researchers think might help them
track each other during highspeed chases

  
Mantis shrimp have a whopping
 kinds of photoreceptors

  
with five reserved just for the 
ultraviolet or UV spectrum

  
which humans can’t see

  
But experiments suggest 
that the mantis shrimp’s ability

  
to discriminate between colors 
is more limited than you might expect

  
Exactly how they use their complex eyes
is a mystery

  
Meanwhile with just four kinds
of color photoreceptors

  
goldfish actually excel at discerning
subtle differences in shades

  
Finally insects have mastered the ability
to see the world on the fly

  
The fastest motion vision 
requires photoreceptors

  
that quickly sense changes in light

  
and a brain that rapidly
processes the information

  
A movie shot at  frames per second
gives us the perception

  
of near seamless motion

  
But insects would see a slideshow

  
Fly photoreceptors register changes 
 times faster than we do

  
making them especially hard to catch

  
These animals have some 
of the best vision we know of

  
but there's no winner across the board

  
Each category has different top contenders
because vision requires tradeoffs

  
So some eyes are highly specialized

  
while others like ours 
perform decently in many categories

  
From eyes the size of soccer balls 
to those that see in UV—

  
the ways of looking at the world 
are as varied as the life forms in it

  
I often get this question

  
"Why would anyone buy
a piece of clothing that doesn't exist"

  
And as you can see
it's not that it doesn't exist

  
Digital fashion is real and it exists
in so many virtual universes

  
ranging from basic social networks

  
to fully developed virtual worlds
known as the metaverse

  
letting people express themselves
in a way not possible before

  
I’ve been playing video games
since I [can] remember

  
dressing up my game character

  
Actually I enjoyed it more
than dressing up myself

  
Five years ago I was running
a physical fashion brand

  
But because of my gaming experience

  
I kept thinking

  
“How and why could people
wear digital garments”

  
And there was a reason
I believed they would

  
In  I did research
on “hypebeast culture”

  
You know those people
buying and selling garments

  
that are always sold out

  
As part of this research

  
I've joined various Facebook groups
where they were gathering

  
What I noticed was
they were usually buying those pieces

  
just to post a photo of themselves
wearing it on their social channels

  
And later on they would resell it

  
So they didn't need or want
the actual garment

  
They wanted its image
and that image was being used online

  
And it made sense to me

  
because like most of my generation

  
they had their friends peers
role models in the virtual space

  
and this is where we care
to express ourselves

  
This is when I started experimenting

  
with what today we know
as digital fashion

  
Now I run the world's first
directtoconsumer digital fashion brand

  
and a fashion tech house

  
We officially started last year

  
and our growth has been unimaginable
from a traditional fashion perspective

  
Apart from doing our own designs

  
we regularly collaborate
with the biggest names from the industry

  
With Carolina Herrera
we collaborated on a runway dress

  
and developed an app

  
where you can wear the dress
on your phone using augmented reality

  
And with Jean Paul Gaultier

  
we collaborated on a piece
that was part of their couture collection

  
We even have our flagship store
in the Decentraland

  
a metaverse owned
and created by its users

  
And we are not the only ones

  
For example on Demat an NFT marketplace

  
fashion brands are selling authenticated
digital fashion items

  
that are usually sold out
as soon as they are released

  
And as it was for me

  
the games are becoming
a gateway to digital fashion for many

  
The biggest names in the luxury segment
are eagerly trying to enter this space

  
Balenciaga has collaborated with Fortnite

  
and Gucci bag was sold inside Roblox
for more than its worth in real life

  
Fortnite itself has sold more than two
billion worth of skins and game extras

  
for ingame character dressing

  
But it's a misconception that creating
digital fashion is quick and easy

  
We often have to play by the same rules
as in reallife physical fashion

  
Think back to a time
when there were no computers

  
and people were making posters by hand

  
When the software like
Adobe Photoshop finally arrived

  
they thought making posters
is going to be so much quicker and easier

  
But obviously that wasn't true

  
because technology just replaced outdated
principles with new possibilities

  
So instead of doing most
of the development in the physical space

  
we do it in front of our screens

  
The process is the same
just the tools are different

  
And in the end

  
everything falls back to a complexity
of a piece or a concept

  
For example

  
there's a huge difference
in creating a basic Tshirt

  
or a couturelike dress
regardless of the medium

  
And the digital realm somehow forces you
to go into that exploratory direction

  
Because do you even need
a physical Tshirt in a virtual space

  
With digital fashion you can experience
fashion in its purest form

  
devoid of functional barriers

  
You don't need your sleeves there

  
You don't even need your hands

  
Digital fashion is not an alternative
but an evolutionary step

  
And we are currently
at the beginning of this new era

  
An era where digital garments could become
an added layer to our reality

  
where you will be able to instantly choose
to whom you want to present yourself

  
wearing multiple different
outfits at the same time

  
and using most advanced technology
like AR or VR for example

  
And not only does it allow
for selfexpression

  
in totally different contexts

  
but digital fashion can be zerowaste
and inclusive available to users

  
regardless of their gender size or race

  
I come from Croatia

  
a country that is nowhere
on the fashion map

  
yet my company is considered
one of the pioneers of this field

  
When we started
we were among the few doing it

  
And since then

  
a whole new evolving market
has grown around it

  
Digital fashion market
is going to be huge

  
But from my experience
no one knows how far it could go

  
It's fairly simple

  
Technology usually grows exponentially
and so will our virtual presence

  
And someone has to dress these people

  
Thank you

  
Hello everyone

  
It is a tremendous pleasure to be here

  
to share with you my story

  
You’ve all heard of brainwaves

  
For a long time neuroscientists
didn't know what they meant

  
But we slowly come
to understand their purpose

  
The brain generates waves
with different paces or frequencies

  
to transmit information and thoughts

  
by coordinating the activity
of nerve cells

  
These waves are a little like the effect

  
of the orchestra conductor waving a baton

  
to keep the musicians synchronized

  
I'm going to talk today

  
about the waves that have
the socalled gamma frequency

  
These gamma waves
are particularly important

  
for synchronizing brain activity
to process new information

  
from the senses and for
learning and memory

  
You might be surprised to learn

  
that when these gamma waves
are weaker than they should be

  
this may contribute
to Alzheimer's disease

  
Indeed my laboratory
and others have shown

  
that in people with Alzheimer's

  
and in laboratory mice
that model the disease

  
gamma waves at the frequency of  hertz

  
have reduced power and synchrony
than they should be

  
So back in 

  
we got an idea

  
What if we artificially
boosted these waves

  
Would that affect Alzheimer's disease

  
We have to know the answer
because we are an aging society

  
As we have made progress
in treating many other health problems

  
we've begun living long enough
to develop others

  
In the last  years

  
the Alzheimer's Association estimates

  
deaths from heart disease
declined by about seven percent

  
But the number of deaths
from Alzheimer's disease

  
increased  percent

  
One in three seniors in the US
dies [from] Alzheimer’s disease

  
or another dementia they say

  
And more than  million people

  
provide unpaid care

  
for their loved ones with Alzheimer's

  
So this means that probably
most of us in this room

  
have known and loved someone
with Alzheimer's

  
I am no exception

  
One day when I was four

  
I went out with my grandmother

  
And when I looked up to her to say

  
"Let's go home"

  
She said "Home

  
Where is home"

  
So to see if we could treat
Alzheimer's disease

  
by changing brainwaves

  
we tried out different approaches

  
By working with my colleagues

  
Emery Brown and Ed Boyden at MIT

  
we figured out that we could entrain

  
or stimulate increased gamma waves

  
by simply showing mice lights
blinking at that frequency

  
This really works

  
Showing mice hertz flickering light 

  
and we demonstrated later

  
placing of hertz buzzing sound 
creates a hertz disco

  
that increases the power and synchrony

  
of these waves across the brain

  
The effect reaches key parts of the brain

  
such as the prefrontal cortex

  
where we do planning and reasoning

  
and the hippocampus
where we create memories

  
So the light and sound
stimulation approach

  
seems cool and flashy

  
Literally

  
But what amazes the most
is that it produced profound

  
and widespread benefits

  
in mice engineered to model this disease

  
Mice exposed to gamma light
and sound stimulation

  
had major reductions in protein buildups

  
amyloid plaques and tau tangles

  
that are hallmarks
of Alzheimer's progression

  
The stimulation preserved
more of the connections

  
or synapses that bind
nerve cells into circuits

  
More cells survived
so the brain decayed less

  
The brain naturally has open spaces
known as ventricles

  
And in the brain of mice left untreated

  
these ventricles became very big

  
But in the brain of mice
exposed to gammawave stimulation

  
these ventricles are closer
to the size of healthy mice

  
And consistent with all of these
physical differences

  
Alzheimer's mice exposed
to light and sound stimulation

  
show better performance
on learning and memory tests

  
than untreated mice did

  
We are still studying
why stimulating gamma waves works

  
But we have made some key observations

  
The brain has immune cells
known as microglia

  
that are supposed to maintain health
by removing waste

  
These cells change their form and activity

  
following gamma wave stimulation

  
We've also seen that the blood
vessels in the brain

  
respond to the stimulation

  
These vessels widen their diameters
to increase blood flow for instance

  
This improved circulation
may play a key role

  
in flushing out waste as well

  
So mice are nice

  
But people are the point

  
So my group and others have begun testing

  
gamma light and sound
stimulation in humans

  
We've developed a delivery device

  
that our volunteers
can use in their homes

  
It’s a postersized light box
with a speaker underneath

  
to produce synchronized
hertz sensory stimulation

  
A little tablet in the middle
allows them to play videos

  
when they are getting stimulated

  
Recently we have begun to see data

  
emerge from these pilot clinical studies

  
Annabelle Singer a former
member of our MIT team

  
and now a professor at Georgia Tech

  
recently published encouraging results

  
showing that gamma light
and sound stimulation

  
entrains stronger gamma waves in people

  
And their brains show increased
connectivity and synchrony

  
My group has made some similar findings

  
including signs of preservation
of brain volume

  
and cognitive improvement

  
A private company we cofounded
Cognito Therapeutics

  
has also seen benefits in human testing

  
including reduced brain atrophy
and improvement in mental functioning

  
While we still have more work to do

  
to determine the full clinical efficacy

  
we have provided a lot of evidence
that this approach appears safe

  
Our participants use
their devices consistently

  
and tolerate gamma wave stimulation well

  
Unlike a drug

  
this stimulation
is completely noninvasive

  
and has minimal side effects

  
which could make
this approach very accessible

  
We are now working to launch a new study

  
of whether gammawave stimulation
can effectively delay

  
the incidence of Alzheimer's disease

  
Given the prevalence of Alzheimer’s
disease in our aging population

  
and how safe this gamma light and sound
stimulation approach appears to be

  
I sometimes dream of a gamma society

  
where we integrate gamma wave stimulation
into our daily environment

  
through our lighting
or even our video entertainment

  
Maybe we will have a better world

  
and a brighter future

  
if we can keep our brainwaves

  
and therefore our mind
and memory well stimulated

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Chris Anderson Thank you so very much

  
I actually would have so many questions

  
but the clock is not our friend

  
I'm going to ask you one

  
The cause of Alzheimer's

  
like the implication
of what you're saying

  
is that it's possible
that an actual causal factor

  
is this falloff in the gamma brainwaves

  
Is that how you see it
or what is the picture

  
LiHuei Tsai You know obviously

  
the causes for Alzheimer's disease
are very complex

  
There are a lot of genetic factors
and environmental factors

  
But one thing is that this compromise
of the gamma waves

  
happens very early
in the course of the disease

  
And you know as I alluded to earlier

  
it has tremendous effects
on many different cell types

  
many different functions in the brain

  
So it is very likely

  
that these impaired gamma waves
leads to the build up

  
of the protein aggregates and pathology

  
But I would also like to mention

  
that this impairment
of these other cell types

  
and other processes in the brain

  
can also impact the strength
of the gamma waves

  
So if you think about
the pathophysiology of the disease

  
it's like a runaway train
that eventually crashes

  
So I think that this
light and sound approach

  
what it does is to give
a break of this process

  
and give the brain an opportunity to heal

  
CA So you are not necessarily arguing
that gammaray therapy

  
would be a complete
prevention of Alzheimer's

  
but that it could
in combination with other things

  
it could play an absolutely critical role

  
LHT It depends on when
do you start the treatment

  
So if you start early 

  
so that’s why we are now testing

  
whether this approach can delay
the incidence of the disease

  
CA If you start early enough
you really believe

  
that alone could delay materially
the onset of Alzheimer's

  
LHT We'll see
we're starting a clinical trial

  
CA Thank you so much
thank you for your work

  
(Applause)

  
(Saw whirrs)

  
Picture a typical construction site

  
The heavy machinery

  
and the work trucks
filled with lumber and steel

  
Now picture the construction crew

  
hard at work in their DayGlo vests
and hard hats

  
their tool belts
slung over dusty dungarees

  
Now picture that that crew is all women

  
(Applause)

  
(Saw whirs)

  
So if you just had a brief moment
of cognitive dissonance

  
you're probably not the only one

  
Our stereotypical image
of “the construction worker” is male

  
And by the numbers
it's not hard to see why

  
Only  percent of the construction
industry in the US is female

  
and that includes operational positions

  
On the front lines
of actual construction sites

  
only four percent
of construction workers are female

  
(Drill whirrs)

  
Four percent

  
Just one in 

  
That's totally unacceptable

  
But it's also a huge opportunity
both for women and for the trades

  
A new wave of tradeswomen 

  
carpenters welders
electricians and masons 

  
are rising through the ranks

  
armed with their power tools

  
creative thinking and new ideas

  
about who can and should
get to build our world

  
(Drill whirrs)

  
I am determined to help more women
enter into and grow in the trades

  
because these are exciting
wellpaying and essential jobs

  
More than just an economic
opportunity though

  
is a chance for women
to play an equal and substantive role

  
in the making of our physical world

  
Construction for many women
is purposedriven work

  
a career in which power tools
represent personal power

  
I want to walk on sidewalks

  
cross bridges and enter buildings

  
that I know were raised
by a community of builders

  
that represents us all

  
(Applause)

  
I want to live in a world built by women

  
and I mean that in the most literal sense

  
I have loved building things
for as long as I can remember

  
And when I was  years old
a petite nerdy multiracial young woman

  
I walked on to my first construction site
and it changed everything

  
(Saw whirrs)

  
As I worked alongside
skilled masons and carpenters

  
learned how to frame a roof
and mix concrete by hand

  
for the first time in my life
I felt powerful

  
(Saw whirrs)

  
And at the end of that project

  
I stood back and looked
at what we had built 

  
a town park with a performance stage
paths and public furniture

  
and I knew that I had something
to contribute to the world

  
Construction transformed
my hopes and anxieties

  
into something tangible and beautiful

  
something that I could
point to and say “I built that”

  
So I went on to study architecture

  
and then I worked in architecture
and construction management

  
And as I found myself
on job sites more frequently

  
I was almost always the only woman

  
And it never crossed my mind
to quit because of this

  
but I did feel very lonely
and I longed for a sense of community

  
(Saw whirrs)

  
And over the past two decades

  
as I have found and built
that community for myself

  
I've realized that the reasons
that I love construction are not unique

  
And that for my fellow tradeswomen

  
we all walk on to a job site
with the same shared sense of purpose

  
We know that for us
building is both our power and our voice

  
(Saw whirrs)

  
When I talk to my fellow tradeswomen

  
they agree that working
in construction is gratifying

  
it’s creative and it’s fun

  
It does not require some stereotypically
masculine brute strength 

  
that is what heavy machinery is for

  
(Laughter)

  
Construction is mostly problemsolving

  
visual and spatial reasoning
and a lot of communication and teamwork

  
For women a job in construction
can pay more than twice the hourly wage

  
of a comparable job
in child care or health aid work

  
And while the gender pay gap in the US
hovers around  cents earned by women

  
for every maleearned dollar

  
in construction
the pay gap is nearly nonexistent

  
at  cents to the dollar

  
(Applause)

  
Construction and construction management

  
are also among the fastest
growing jobs for women

  
with clear paths
into advancement and leadership

  
These are also jobs

  
with learnwhileyouearn
training programs

  
making them financially feasible careers
to enter or to transition into

  
(Drill whirrs)

  
The trades desperately need women too

  
With over  jobs left unfilled

  
women are a hugely untapped labor pool

  
And this is a time when the demand
for infrastructure is only growing

  
And new building technologies
will require new skills

  
and new perspectives

  
to break from the way
it's always been done

  
(Drill whirrs)

  
We already understand the value

  
of having more women
in historically maledominated spaces

  
like politics Csuites and STEM

  
What is it going to take for tradeswomen
to take part and to take over

  
We do need a few things
from the industry in greater numbers

  
We need more active recruitment

  
and more equitable hiring practices

  
And we need leaders of all genders

  
to step up advocate
for a better workplace culture

  
and to bring others along with them

  
(Saw whirrs)

  
But our best invested effort
is looking to the future

  
We must create intentional spaces

  
for the next generation of tradeswomen
to learn technical skills

  
while being unconditionally supported
by a community of other women

  
(Drill whirrs)

  
So in  I founded a nonprofit

  
to teach design and construction skills
to middle and high school students

  
specifically young women of color

  
Now nearly  years later

  
that nonprofit Girls Garage

  
has taught over  girls
and genderexpansive youth

  
how to use power tools 

  
(Applause)

  
how to use power tools

  
weld draft construction documents

  
and work on a job site

  
And together we have built
over  probono projects

  
for other nonprofits in our community

  
(Applause)

  
(Drill whirrs)

  
When young women walk into Girls Garage

  
they're acknowledged as capable and whole

  
They are taught by female instructors

  
who are architects
and carpenters and welders

  
who have lived lives
and who've walked paths

  
similar to their own

  
When a student uses the chop saw
for the very first time

  
I'm standing right next to them
saying "You got this"

  
And these are the things
that make the difference

  
And so the next generation
of tradeswomen our students

  
will enter the trades

  
knowing what it feels like
to be respected and valued

  
and will know how to demand it
when they're not

  
(Applause)

  
I may not have had a female mentor
on my first construction site

  
but I can pay forward what I lacked
to the yearold in front of me

  
In step with other youth organizations
and apprenticeship programs

  
we're creating strong
communities of tradeswomen

  
as a microcosm for what we believe
the industry needs at a macro level

  
We're filling their toolboxes
with drills and saws and ferocity and joy

  
These are the young women

  
who will go forth
to build the world we all want to see

  
(Applause)

  
So when I picture a construction site
they are the crew that I imagine

  
This is my actual Girls Garage crew
the construction crew of my dreams

  
This is not a pipe dream

  
It's already a reality

  
but one that we must name
and nurture and multiply

  
It is our job now to demand
unconditional support for tradeswomen

  
in their quest to play a vital role
in the construction of our world

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
It was a strange feeling
walking into the local supermarket

  
only to find empty shelves

  
and most notably no toilet paper

  
We didn't have rawmaterial shortages
or manufacturing defects

  
and we didn't discover
new uses for toilet paper

  
It was panic buying by everyday people

  
Supply chains just couldn't keep up

  
And before we knew it
the rumored shortage became a real one

  
You remember that don't you

  
Well maybe not because
I'm not talking about COVID

  
I'm talking about the great
toilet paper shortage of 

  
And it wasn't caused by a pandemic

  
but by a joke told by Johnny Carson

  
But today's supplychain
challenges are no joke

  
Those problems are real

  
but they're problems that we've faced
and even solved in the past

  
A supply chain is the long
and often complicated journey

  
that any item takes
before it winds up in your home

  
Raw materials are mined or grown

  
and sold to various suppliers

  
Those suppliers sell them
to manufacturers

  
who transform those raw materials
into finished goods

  
And those finished goods
are moved around the world

  
by distributors and carriers

  
who in turn sell them to retailers

  
who sell those to consumers
as a final step

  
Many supply chains are simple

  
like when you buy strawberries
at a local farmers market

  
But some are almost infinitely complex

  
In my  years working with companies
on improving their supply chains

  
I've seen many disruptions
from natural disasters to pandemics

  
and geopolitical instability

  
And every time the media
talks about how from this point

  
companies can and will
make their supply chains more resilient

  
and the common prescriptions
include diversifying risk

  
better forecasting the future

  
and building buffers
like stockpiles of inventory

  
or more manufacturing equipment

  
And this is good advice

  
But the question I keep asking myself is

  
“Why haven’t more companies
taken this advice”

  
The reason is that it doesn't stand up
against competing priorities

  
and steep competition that occurs
between the crises and shocks

  
So if we want to build
more resilient supply chains

  
that can withstand the next great crisis

  
then we need to bring new ideas
that can withstand competitive pressures

  
Let's talk about sharing risk

  
radical transparency
and automated recommendations

  
These three ideas
if we take them together

  
have the potential
to help break the tradeoff

  
between resilience and efficiency

  
An obvious solution to supply shortages
is to build more buffers

  
so that if anything happens
along the supply chain

  
the next recipient
isn't waiting emptyhanded

  
Retail stores can never
perfectly predict what we'll buy

  
so they carry extra inventory

  
They might run out of a particular size
or particular color

  
but it’s unlikely that they’ll run out
of an entire category like jeans

  
But we know across industries

  
companies carry less of that backup
inventory than they used to

  
And we have immense product variety

  
But much of what we buy

  
is made in highly specialized
or automated factories

  
and that makes it harder to repurpose
that capacity when demand changes

  
That's why during COVID

  
those toiletpaper manufacturers
had enough capacity

  
but they didn't have
the right kind of capacity

  
Commercial toilet paper is very different
from what we consumers use at home

  
They could have met demand

  
but it would have meant shoppers lugging
home rolls that are nine inches wide

  
and clearly designed for cost
not for comfort

  
(Laughter)

  
Streamlining supply chains

  
is a big reason why we consumers have
incredible choices at low prices

  
And for many companies

  
warehousing extra raw materials

  
or keeping idle equipment
on the factory floor

  
is simply too expensive

  
Competition is steep as it is

  
But buffers matter in a crisis

  
So how do we get similar benefits
but in a different way

  
We can share or pool risk

  
It's much like a wellestablished industry
that we all know well 

  
insurance

  
It's unlikely that you'll ever get
into a major car accident

  
but if you do
it will be horribly expensive

  
That's why for lowprobability
highimpact events

  
we share risk

  
and in some instances like car insurance

  
we even require it

  
We could do the same thing
in supply chains

  
Industry players could team up to share
the cost of keeping extra raw materials

  
key components or even machinery

  
in exchange for an ongoing shared fee

  
and only to be used in times of a crisis

  
For example

  
many countries stockpile
important medicines

  
but relatively few keep
their active ingredients or "APIs"

  
Pharmaceutical companies could share
the cost of storing extra APIs

  
during normal times

  
Then in a crisis

  
drug manufacturers
could dip into that supply

  
to avoid running out
of these important medicines

  
Again it's just like insurance

  
except instead of pooling money
we're pooling a physical resource

  
And importantly it would be paid for
and so not seen as pure waste

  
But in order to do this we need to know
who shares the same risks

  
And in order to know that

  
we need a radical improvement
in supplychain transparency

  
Right now seemingly everything
we want to buy is delayed

  
because of a lack of microprocessors

  
even cars

  
But how could the auto industry 

  
arguably the industry that invented
supplier collaboration

  
and supplychain visibility 

  
be caught by surprise

  
Microprocessors power the computers

  
that increasingly make our cars work
the way they're supposed to

  
And early in the COVID pandemic

  
auto manufacturers canceled orders
for microprocessors

  
out of fear that car sales would plummet

  
And around the same time

  
demand for those microprocessors
in consumer electronics went way up

  
Parents bought tablets
so their kids could learn from home

  
newly remote workers bought laptops

  
Then a fire at a chip plant

  
meant fewer of these microprocessors
were even being made

  
And by the time car sales
began to recover

  
microprocessors were on back order

  
In other words

  
the reason why automotive companies
can't get the microprocessors they need

  
has little if anything to do
with the automotive industry

  
And this is a good example
of a broader problem

  
In supply chain

  
your risks are not tied only
to your customers or to your competitors

  
but also to those companies
who are using the same inputs

  
I doubt Ford considers the PlayStation 
to be a competitor to the F

  
but in this case they could have been
competing for the same scarce resource

  
And that's why we need a radical
improvement in supplychain transparency

  
It's not enough to know
who your suppliers are

  
You have to know
who your supplier's suppliers are

  
where those supplier’s suppliers
get their raw materials

  
who else is buying from those suppliers

  
and who else is competing
for those raw materials

  
Often what looks like several
unrelated product lines

  
can be traced back to a single source

  
We think we have diversified
supply chains but we don't

  
We have a supply web

  
And if key players in that web fail

  
then many supply chains
are in big trouble

  
If we want more resilient supply chains

  
then we need accurate
uptodate maps of key inputs

  
and where they come from

  
in any given industry

  
Supplychain managers
are fundamentally planners

  
They analyze and interpret information

  
and they revise their plans
to efficiently meet expected demand

  
with a steady stream of supply

  
Supplychain control towers bring
all of that information into one place

  
and better data should help
better decisionmaking

  
But too much data
can simply be overwhelming

  
and that's why we need
technology to help us

  
The good news is that advances
in data mining

  
artificial intelligence
and machine learning

  
increasingly mean
that computers can help us

  
analyze thousands or millions
of points of data

  
predict problems
before they arise notify managers

  
and even recommend actions to take

  
Right now some types of plastics
are in short supply

  
Plastic resin manufacturers
decreased production

  
dealing with COVID outbreaks

  
But by the time they began to recover

  
they were hit with a string
of natural disasters

  
from Hurricane Laura
on the Gulf Coast in 

  
to a brutal winter storm
in the South in 

  
No amount of datasharing
could have told us

  
what companies would be affected

  
what companies don't use plastics

  
But a computer could have helped
spot the problem among the data points

  
Decreased production
and COVID lockdowns

  
combined with severe weather

  
a surge in demand for plastic packaging
as grocery sales grew

  
and a spike in trucking rates

  
would have been enough to trigger
some warnings in specific areas

  
and then notify managers
and recommend what they might do about it

  
"Hey this supplier is looking risky

  
Do you have a chance
to order from somebody else

  
Maybe start calling
other trucking companies

  
to make sure you get
your supplies on time

  
and we should notify these customers
that their orders might be delayed"

  
This is similar
to how the airline industry

  
manages passenger delays
and missed connections

  
Computers analyze data
on available flights weather conditions

  
passenger locations
and passenger destinations

  
to reroute hundreds or even thousands
of people in a day

  
And we could do the same thing
in a supply chain

  
I don’t want to sound

  
like the things supply chain managers
have done haven’t helped

  
but we can do better

  
When the virus struck

  
we faced a dire need for N respirators
and personal protective equipment

  
Government stockpiles
of Ns were depleted

  
hospital orders were backlogged
two to three years

  
and healthcare workers
reused singleuse protective equipment

  
But again I'm not talking about COVID

  
I'm talking about the  outbreak
of the HN flu

  
And we have to stop repeating
the same mistakes

  
So let's be imaginative

  
about how we challenge
businesses and government

  
to use shared risk

  
supplychain transparency
and automated recommendations

  
to make our supply chains more resilient

  
Because if they do

  
we can be more resilient too

  
Thank you

  
(Cheers and applause)

  
So I'm going to talk to you
about carbon removals

  
and I’m going to start with this

  
This is a woolly pig

  
(Laughter)

  
She's gorgeous obviously

  
and she’s also one part
in a whole new set of approaches

  
for dealing with climate change

  
They are all called carbon removals

  
and they all involve
taking CO out of the sky

  
and storing it somewhere safe

  
I’ll come back to the woolly pig later

  
but first why do we need carbon removals

  
Because I know what you’re thinking

  
isn’t it easier to stop
putting the carbon in the atmosphere

  
in the first place

  
And the answer is yes of course it is

  
We have to do everything we can
as fast as we can

  
to stop carbon getting into the sky

  
and stop climate change getting worse

  
That should not be a controversial
point of view at this meeting

  
But the problem is 

  
we’ve left it too late

  
We can't now do it fast enough

  
I've been working on climate change
for more than  years

  
and I’ve talked about it
in boardrooms and classrooms

  
and everywhere in between

  
and I was shocked when I found this out

  
but the science is utterly 

  
utterly clear

  
If we’re going to have a fighting chance
of staying below  degrees

  
that “safe limit”

  
we have to have carbon removals

  
and it looks like
we’re going to need a lot

  
Scenarios from the Energy
Transitions Commission

  
from the International Energy Agency

  
from the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change

  
have all shown that we’re going to need
billions of tonnes of carbon removals

  
between now and 

  
to give us a chance
of staying below  degrees

  
We’re going to need
both reductions and removals

  
But there's another more heartening reason
why we need carbon removals

  
They also give us a chance 

  
our only chance 

  
not just to stop the problem
getting worse

  
but to make it better

  
Because even  degrees
isn't actually safe

  
We’re not there yet and we’re already
experiencing the fires and the floods

  
and the droughts and the storms

  
With carbon removals

  
we can take our historical emissions
out of the atmosphere

  
We can clean up the mess we’ve made

  
and we can give our world
a chance to heal

  
So what do the removals look like

  
I’ve been talking to a lot of people
about carbon removals

  
from business executives
to climate activists

  
and they tend to go one of two ways

  
They either think of trees

  
or they think of big futuristic machines

  
Nature versus tech;

  
green versus chrome

  
But the more I’ve dug
into carbon removals

  
the more I’ve realized this is not
the right way to think about them

  
Because the world
is full of ways to store carbon

  
You can store it in trees

  
you can store it in soils

  
you can store it in the ocean

  
you can store it in buildings

  
you can store it in rocks

  
you can store it deep underground

  
And every one of those approaches requires
some combination of natural resources

  
and human ingenuity

  
and technology

  
We’re going to need
both nature and technology

  
I'll show you what I mean

  
So we start on the natural
end of the spectrum with trees

  
Now I still find it astonishing

  
that every single tree and plant on Earth

  
has made its entire body
directly from carbon in the air

  
They’re incredible
carbon capture machines

  
and we’re going to need
a lot more of them

  
But we also have to do it right

  
because if you put trees
in the wrong place 

  
they burn

  
We have to put trees in places
where they foster biodiversity

  
where they don’t compete
with food for land

  
and where science and technology
tell us they are likely to survive

  
even in the face of climate change

  
Now if you don’t want
that CO from the burning trees

  
to get into the sky

  
you can actually burn the wood
deliberately in a power station

  
capture the CO

  
and bury it in a process known as BECCS

  
which also gives you energy as a sideline

  
But if you want to keep
the carbon locked up in the wood

  
there are technological ways
to do that as well

  
like this one

  
Look at this

  
A whole new movement
to use wood as a building material

  
in modern highrise buildings

  
That’s a good idea
for at least three reasons

  
First of all it keeps
the carbon locked up in the wood

  
Secondly it displaces
highemitting materials like concrete

  
And thirdly the buildings are gorgeous

  
Now you can also use technology
to help carbon stay locked up in soil

  
Storing carbon in soil
sounds like a good idea

  
and it is a good idea

  
The question is how long
does the carbon stay there

  
Because if you change your agricultural
practices for one year two years

  
that’s fine

  
But if you ever go back to the old ways

  
the carbon goes back up into the sky

  
That’s why this stuff can help

  
It’s called biochar

  
and you make it by taking wood
and burning it in the absence of oxygen

  
until you get this

  
It locks the carbon up in the wood

  
and now it can’t burn away

  
Now it turns out that biochar
is very good for soils

  
In fact Indigenous people in the Amazon
have been using it for generations

  
to improve the quality of their soil

  
We can do that on a much bigger scale

  
improve the soil

  
and lock up carbon

  
That’s nature

  
and technology

  
and Indigenous wisdom

  
all in one sweet package

  
Now you can use technology as well 

  
to speed up natural processes

  
So this is basalt

  
It’s a volcanic rock

  
You can find it more or less
everywhere on Earth

  
and it naturally takes up CO
in a process called chemical weathering

  
Unfortunately it takes
thousands of years to do it

  
But you can speed up the process
if you grind up the rock

  
and spread it on fields

  
and then you can speed it up
to just a couple of years

  
And like biochar it’s good for the soil

  
You get minerals in the soil
where you need them

  
And when it washes off into the sea

  
it can also help with another
big bugbear of climate change

  
ocean acidification

  
And if we did this on twothirds
of the world’s croplands

  
we could potentially take
up to four billion tonnes of carbon

  
from the atmosphere every year

  
which is a very big chunk of what we need

  
Now these approaches so far

  
like planting trees

  
take a lot of land
to be able to get them to scale

  
But there is one approach

  
where you can actually do it
in a very small amount of land

  
but still get to scale

  
It’s called direct air capture

  
and it basically involves
massive electric fans blowing a lot of air

  
over a carbon capture device

  
Now OK this does look 
like a big futuristic machine

  
I admit that

  
But it’s still marrying technology
with a natural process 

  
geology 

  
because when you’ve captured the CO

  
you bury it deep underground

  
This is an artist’s impression
of a plant that’s being designed

  
by Carbon Engineering in Texas

  
And its aim is that it will take up

  
one million tonnes of CO
from the atmosphere every year

  
And I love this bit 

  
where does it go

  
They put it deep underground
in the same geological formations

  
that the Texas oil
was originally squeezed out of

  
I love the poetry of this

  
It’s like reversing the valve

  
and putting the CO
back where it came from

  
And recent studies have shown
that if you do that

  
 percent of it will still
be there in  years

  
When you put it down

  
it stays down

  
This is still a little bit futuristic

  
It’s still in the planning
and design stages

  
but this carbon capture plant
started operating this year

  
A smaller scale

  
but it’s already doing it

  
This is Climeworks and Carbfix in Iceland

  
They're using geothermal heat to power it

  
and they’re putting the CO
into the Icelandic basaltic rock

  
So one issue though
with direct air capture

  
is it takes a lot of energy
to power those fans

  
And that energy obviously has to be green

  
It has to be clean;

  
you can’t use fossil fuels for it

  
But it also makes it much more expensive
than other techniques

  
And it takes energy to cook wood
and to grind rock

  
and so all of those approaches
I’m talking about

  
are currently much more expensive
than planting trees

  
But we can do something about that

  
We can invest in it now

  
do the research and development

  
and get them down the cost curve
to make them affordable

  
It worked for solar power;

  
it worked for wind;

  
it can work for carbon removals too

  
Remember we have to get
to very big scale

  
billions of tonnes
of carbon removals by 

  
But we can all help by reducing
our emissions as much as possible

  
and figuring out how to remove the rest

  
I’m not talking conventional offsets

  
You know I put a tonne of CO in the air

  
and I pay you not to put
your tonne in the air

  
but my tonne’s still there

  
No what I mean is I put
a tonne of CO in the air

  
I pay someone to take a tonne
out of the air now or in the near future

  
and we can get to zero and beyond

  
What goes up must now come down

  
And if we all do that

  
if we all make that commitment

  
then the people trying to make
removals happen will have the finance

  
and the courage

  
and the confidence to be able
to get to the scale that we need

  
I don’t know which of all
of these approaches

  
in the end

  
are going to be the ones
that we’ll have to use

  
to get us to the scale we need

  
But I do know that we’re going to need
a whole spread of them

  
with nature and technology
working hand in hand

  
to take CO out of the sky

  
and keep it out

  
Which brings me neatly back 

  
to the woolly pigs

  
(Laughter)

  
Now these woolly pigs live
on an estate on the Isle of Mull

  
which is owned by Jim Mann’s
Future Forest Company

  
And I know they don’t look very dangerous

  
but they are actually
the closest you can get

  
to a native Scottish wild boar

  
without having to have
a dangerous animals license

  
And they do what the Scottish
wild boars used to do

  
They rootle up the undergrowth
left over from selective grazing

  
They let the seed bank
come to the surface

  
so that native trees can start to grow

  
and start to take up CO from the sky

  
They're also planting trees
in this lovely place

  
Native broadleaf like oak
and this beech tree

  
and it’s plenty wet enough
on the Isle of Mull

  
that they’re not likely to burn

  
So that’s so far so natural

  
But they also have machines

  
This one is getting ready to cook wood
for biochar to go on the soils

  
and they’ve also got a quarry with basalt

  
They’re quarrying basalt rock

  
They’ve got machines to grind up the rock

  
and they’ve got machines
to spread it on the fields

  
That's three carbon removals approaches
in one beautiful place

  
Now it’s just one estate

  
but all of these approaches
and more are hugely scalable

  
The world is full of places
where you can plant trees

  
and put carbon in soil

  
and grind up rock and spread it

  
and capture CO from the air

  
and find places to store it underground

  
All of those things

  
And there’s hundreds 

  
thousands of people working right now

  
to get those carbon removals approaches
out of the textbook

  
and into practice

  
and to help us 

  
God help us 

  
reverse the damage we have done

  
and start the process of climate healing

  
And when I sat on that hillside

  
and I saw the pigs rootling

  
and the trees growing

  
and the machines
getting ready to cook and grind

  
I loved it 

  
because I experienced an emotion

  
that those of us who work
on climate change

  
very rarely experience

  
I felt hope

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Bruno Giussani We are at the end
of day six of the war in Ukraine

  
or more correctly
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
launched on February 
by President Vladimir Putin

  
We are all shocked
and saddened by the events

  
and by the human suffering
they are causing

  
And as we speak really

  
a Russian military convoy
is headed towards Kyiv

  
other Ukrainian cities
are being bombarded

  
half a million Ukrainians have already
fled to neighboring countries

  
and much more

  
It's still early days

  
and it's difficult to predict
how the situation will evolve

  
even just in the next few hours

  
But this is a war that should concern
everyone everywhere

  
And so today in this TED
Membership conversation

  
we want to try to give it
a broader context with our guest

  
historian and author Yuval Noah Harari

  
Yuval welcome

  
Yuval Noah Harari Hello

  
Thank you for inviting me

  
BG I want to start from Ukraine itself
and its  million people

  
and its particular place
between the East and the West

  
What do we need to know about Ukraine

  
to understand this war
and what's at stake

  
YNH The most crucial thing to know
is that Ukrainians are not Russians

  
and that Ukraine is an ancient
independent nation

  
Ukraine has a history
of more than a thousand years

  
Kyiv was a major metropolis
and cultural center

  
when Moscow was not even a village

  
For most of these thousand years
Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow

  
They were not part
of the same political entity

  
For centuries Kyiv was looking westwards

  
and was a part of a union
with Lithuania and Poland

  
until it was eventually conquered
and absorbed by the Russian Empire

  
by the czarist empire

  
But even after that

  
Ukrainians remained
a separate people to a large extent

  
and it's important to know that

  
because this is really
what is at stake in this war

  
The key issue of the war

  
at least for President Putin

  
is whether Ukraine
is an independent nation

  
whether it is a nation at all

  
He has this fantasy
that Ukraine isn't a nation

  
that Ukraine is just a part of Russia

  
that Ukrainians are Russians

  
In his fantasy

  
Ukrainians are Russians that want
to be back in the fold of Mother Russia

  
and that the only ones preventing it
is a very small gang at the top

  
which he portrays as Nazis

  
even if the president is Jewish;
but OK a Nazi Jew

  
And his belief was at least

  
that he just needs to invade

  
Zelenskyy will flee

  
the government will collapse

  
the army would lay down its arms

  
and the Ukrainian people
would welcome the Russian liberators

  
throwing flowers on them

  
And this fantasy
has been shattered already

  
Zelenskyy hasn’t fled

  
the Ukrainian army is fighting

  
And the Ukrainian people is not throwing
flowers on the Russian tanks

  
it's throwing Molotov cocktails

  
BG So let's unpack that

  
and maybe take the different
pieces one way one

  
So Ukraine has a long history
of being dominated and occupied

  
You mentioned the czar
but also the Soviet Union

  
Hitler's armies

  
It also has a long history of mistrust
of authority and of resistance

  
which goes some way to explain
the current strong resistance

  
that the Russians are encountering

  
Anne Applebaum the journalist
even suggests that this mistrust

  
this resistance to authority

  
is the very essence
of Ukraineness do you agree

  
YNH We did see in the last  years
Ukrainians twice rising in revolt

  
when there was a danger

  
of an authoritarian regime
being established 

  
once in  once in 

  
And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago

  
what really struck me
was this very strong feeling

  
of the desire for independence
and for democracy

  
And I remember walking around this museum

  
of the Revolution of 

  
and seeing these images
like these two elderly women

  
who were bringing sandwiches
to the demonstrators

  
to the fighters

  
They couldn’t throw stones
and they couldn’t do anything else

  
so they prepared sandwiches

  
and brought this huge tray
full of sandwiches

  
to the demonstrators

  
And this yes this is the kind of spirit

  
that inspires not just the Ukrainians

  
but everybody who is now watching
what is happening there

  
BG Help me understand
the actual nature of the threat here

  
in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine

  
So in your last book
when you write about Russia

  
you describe the Russian model as
“not a coherent political ideology

  
but rather a sort of practice
of monopolizing power and wealth

  
by a small group at the top"

  
But then in his actions against Ukraine

  
Putin in the last few weeks seems to move
very much by an ideology

  
an ideology of empire
of denial of Ukraine's right to exist

  
as you mention

  
What has changed in the four years
since you wrote that book

  
YNH The imperial dream was always there

  
but you know empires
are often the creation

  
of a very small gang of people at the top

  
I don’t think the Russian people
[are] interested in this war

  
I don't think that the Russian people
want to conquer Ukraine

  
or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv

  
It's all coming from the top

  
So there is no change there

  
I mean when you look at the Soviet Union

  
you can say that there was
this mass ideology

  
which was shared by a large proportion
or some proportion of the population

  
You don't see this now

  
You know Russia is a very rich country

  
rich in resources

  
but most people are very poor

  
Their standard of living is very very low

  
because all the wealth and power
is kind of sucked

  
by the people at the top

  
and very little is left
for everybody else

  
So I don't think it's a society

  
where the masses are part
of this kind of ideological project

  
They're being ruled from the top

  
And you have this classic
imperial situation

  
when the emperor

  
which controls the largest
country in the world

  
feels that "Hey this is not enough

  
I need more"

  
And sends his army to capture

  
to extend the empire

  
BG I said at the beginning

  
that it's difficult of course
to make predictions

  
But yesterday you published
an article in "The Guardian"

  
titled “Why Putin
has already lost this war”

  
Please explain

  
YNH Well one thing should be very clear

  
I don't mean to say

  
that he's going to suffer
an immediate military defeat

  
He definitely has the military
power to conquer Kyiv

  
and perhaps the whole of Ukraine

  
Unfortunately we might see this

  
But his longterm goal

  
the whole rationale of the war

  
is to deny the existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
and to absorb it into Russia

  
And to do that it's not enough
to conquer Ukraine

  
You also need to hold it

  
And it's all based
on this fantasy on this gamble

  
that most of the population
in Ukraine would agree to this

  
would even welcome this

  
And we already know that it's not true

  
That the Ukrainians
are a very real nation;

  
they are fiercely independent;

  
they don’t want to be part of Russia;

  
they will fight like hell

  
And in the longrun again
you can conquer a country

  
But as the Russians learned
in Afghanistan

  
as the Americans learned
also in Afghanistan also in Iraq

  
it's much harder to hold a country

  
And again the big question mark
before the war was always this

  
Before the war started
many things were already known

  
Everybody knew that the Russian army
is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army

  
Everybody knew that NATO will not send
armed forces into Ukraine

  
troops into Ukraine

  
Everybody knew that the West
the Europeans would be hesitant

  
about imposing too strict
a sanction regime

  
for fear of being hurt by it themselves

  
And this was the basis
for Putin's war plan

  
But there was one big unknown

  
Nobody could say for sure
how the Ukrainian people would react

  
And there was always the option

  
that maybe Putin's fantasy
would come true

  
Maybe the Russians will march in

  
Zelenskyy would flee

  
maybe the Ukrainian army
will just capitulate

  
and the population would not do much

  
This was always an option

  
And now we know this was just fantasy

  
Now we know that the Ukrainians
are fighting they will fight

  
And this derails the whole
rationale of Putin’s war

  
Because you can conquer
the country maybe

  
but you won't be able to absorb
Ukraine back into Russia

  
The only thing he's accomplishing

  
he is planting seeds of hatred

  
in the hearts of every Ukrainian

  
Every Ukrainian being killed

  
every day this war continues
is more seeds of hatred

  
that may last for generations

  
Ukrainians and Russians
didn't hate each other before Putin

  
They’re siblings

  
Now he's making them enemies

  
And if he continues
this will be his legacy

  
BG We're going to talk a bit
about that again later but you know

  
at the same time
Putin needs a victory right

  
The cost the human economic
political cost of this war

  
not even a week in
is already astronomical

  
So to justify it and also
to remain by the way

  
a viable leader at the head of Russia

  
Putin needs to win
and even win convincingly

  
So how do we square these things

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean the fact that you need to win
doesn't mean that you can win

  
Lots of political leaders need to win
and sometimes they lose

  
He could stop the war
declare that he won

  
and say that recognizing
Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians

  
is what he really wanted all along
and he achieved this

  
Maybe they cobble this agreement
or I don’t know

  
This is the job of politicians
I'm not a politician

  
But I can tell you that I hope
for the sake of everybody 

  
Ukrainians Russians
and the whole of humanity 

  
that this war stops immediately

  
Because if it doesn't

  
it's not only the Ukrainians
and the Russians

  
that will suffer terribly

  
Everybody will suffer terribly
if this war continues

  
BG Explain why

  
YNH Because of the shock waves
destabilizing the whole world

  
Let’s start with the bottom line

  
budgets

  
We have been living in an amazing era
of peace in the last few decades

  
And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy

  
You saw it in the bottom line

  
You saw it in the budgets

  
In Europe in the European Union

  
the average defense budget of EU members

  
was around three percent
of government budget

  
And that's a historical miracle almost

  
For most of history

  
the budget of kings and emperors
and sultans like  percent

  
 percent goes to war goes to the army

  
In Europe it’s just three percent

  
In the whole world the average
is about six percent I think

  
factcheck me on this
but this is the figure that I know

  
six percent

  
What we saw already within a few days

  
Germany doubles
its military budget in a day

  
And I'm not against it

  
Given what they are facing
it's reasonable

  
For the Germans for the Poles

  
for all of Europe to double their budgets

  
And you see other countries
around the world doing the same thing

  
But this is you know
a race to the bottom

  
When they double their budgets

  
other countries look and feel insecure
and double their budgets

  
so they have to double
them again and triple them

  
And the money that should go
to health care

  
that should go to education

  
that should go to fight climate change

  
this money will now go to tanks
to missiles to fighting wars

  
So there is less
health care for everybody

  
and there is maybe no solution
to climate change

  
because the money goes to tanks

  
And in this way
even if you live in Australia

  
even if you live in Brazil

  
you will feel the repercussions
of this war in less health care

  
in a deteriorating ecological crisis

  
in many other things

  
Again another very central
question is technology

  
We are on the verge
we are already in the middle actually

  
of new technological arms races
in fields like artificial intelligence

  
And we need global agreement
about how to regulate AI

  
and to prevent the worst scenarios

  
How can we get a global agreement on AI

  
when you have a new cold war
a new hot war

  
So in this field to all hopes

  
of stopping the AI arms race
will go up in smoke if this war continues

  
So again everybody around the world
will feel the consequences in many ways

  
This is much much bigger
than just another regional conflict

  
BG If one of Putin's goals here
is to divide Europe

  
to weaken the transatlantic alliance

  
and the global liberal order

  
he seems to kind of accidentally
have revitalized all of them in a way

  
USEU relations have never been
so close in many years

  
And so how do you read that

  
YNH Well again in this sense
he also lost the war

  
If his aim was to divide
Europe to divide NATO

  
he's achieved exactly the opposite

  
I mean I was amazed by how quick

  
how strong and how unanimous
the European reaction was

  
I think the Europeans
surprised themselves

  
You even see countries like Finland
and Sweden sending arms to Ukraine

  
and closing their airspace

  
They didn't even do it in the Cold War

  
It's really amazing to see it

  
I think another very important thing
is what has been dividing the West

  
over the several years now

  
it’s what people term the “culture war”

  
The culture war between left and right
between conservatives and liberals

  
And I think this war can be an opportunity

  
to end the culture war within the West

  
to make peace in the culture war

  
First of all because you suddenly realize
we are all in this together

  
There are much bigger things in the world

  
than these arguments
between left and right

  
within the Western democracies

  
And it's a reminder
that we need to stand united

  
to protect Western liberal democracies

  
But it's deeper than that

  
Much of the argument
between left and right

  
seemed to be in terms of a contradiction

  
between liberalism and nationalism

  
Like you need to choose

  
And the right goes with nationalism

  
and the left goes more liberalism

  
And Ukraine is a reminder that no
the two actually go together

  
Historically nationalism
and liberalism are not opposites

  
They are not enemies

  
They are friends they go together

  
They meet around the central value
of freedom of liberty

  
And to see a nation fighting
for its survival

  
fighting for its freedom

  
you see it on Fox News
or you see it in CNN

  
And yes they tell the story
a little differently

  
but they suddenly see the same reality

  
And they find common ground

  
And the common ground is to understand

  
that nationalism is not about hating
minorities or hating foreigners

  
it's about loving your compatriots

  
and reaching a peaceful agreement

  
about how we want
to run our country together

  
And I hope that seeing what is happening

  
would help to end
the culture war in the West

  
And if this happens we don't need
to worry about anything

  
You know when you look
at the real power balance

  
if the Europeans stick together

  
if the Americans and
the Europeans stick together

  
and stop this culture war
and stop tearing themselves apart

  
they have absolutely nothing to fear 
the Russians or anybody else

  
BG I'm going to ask you a question later
about the stories the West tells itself

  
but let me zoom out for a second
and get a larger perspective

  
You wrote another essay
last week in “The Economist”

  
and you argue that what's at stake
in Ukraine is and I quote you

  
"the direction of human history"

  
because it puts at risk what you call

  
the greatest political and moral
achievement of modern civilization

  
which is the decline of war

  
So now we are back in a war
and potentially afterwards

  
into a new form of cold war or hot war

  
but hopefully not

  
Elaborate about that essay you wrote

  
YNH Yeah I mean some people think

  
that all this talk
about the decline of war

  
was always just a fantasy

  
But 

  
Again you look at the statistics

  
Since 

  
there has not been a single clash
between superpowers

  
whereas previously in history

  
this was you know
the basic stuff of history

  
Since 

  
not a single internationally
recognized country

  
was wiped off the map
by external invasion

  
This was the common thing in history

  
Until then and then it stopped

  
This is an amazing achievement

  
which is the basis for everything we have

  
for our medical services

  
for education system

  
and this is all now in jeopardy

  
Because this era of peace

  
it wasn't the result of some miracle

  
It wasn't the result of a change
in the laws of nature

  
It was humans making better decisions
and building better institutions

  
which means also

  
that there is no guarantee for the future

  
If humans some humans
start making bad decisions

  
and start destroying
the institutions that kept the peace

  
then we will be back in the era of war

  
with budgets military budgets
going to    percent

  
It can happen

  
It's in our hands

  
And I'll just say one more thing

  
When not just me but other scholars
like Steven Pinker and others

  
talked about the era of peace

  
some people understood it
as kind of encouraging complacency

  
That oh we don't need
to worry about anything

  
No I mean the message
was really the opposite

  
It was a message of responsibility

  
If you think that there is no
era of peace in history

  
it's always war it's always the jungle

  
there is a constant level
of violence in nature

  
then this basically means

  
that there is no point
struggling for peace

  
and there is no responsibility
on leaders like Putin

  
because you can't blame Putin for the war

  
It's just a law of nature
that there are wars

  
When you realize no humans are able
to decrease the level of violence

  
then it should make us
much more responsible

  
And it should also make us understand

  
that the war in Ukraine now
it’s not a natural disaster

  
It’s a manmade disaster
and a single man

  
It's not the Russian people
who want this war

  
There's really just a single person

  
who by his decisions

  
created this tragedy

  
BG So one of the things
that has come back

  
in the last weeks and months
is the nuclear threat

  
It's moved back into the center
of political and strategic considerations

  
Putin has talked about it several times

  
the other day he ordered Russia's
nuclear forces on a higher alert status

  
President Zelenskyy himself
at the Munich Security Conference

  
essentially said that Ukraine
had made a mistake

  
abandoning the nuclear weapons
it had inherited from the Soviet Union

  
That's a statement that I suspect
many countries are pondering

  
What's your thinking about the return
of the nuclear threat

  
YNH It's extremely frightening

  
You know it's like it's almost Freudian

  
it's the return of the repressed

  
We thought that oh nuclear weapons yes

  
there was something
about that in the s

  
with the Cuban Missile Crisis
and Dr Strangelove

  
But no it's here

  
And you know it took just a few days

  
of difficulties on the battlefield

  
for suddenly 

  
I mean I'm watching
television like the news

  
and you have these experts
explaining to people

  
what different nuclear weapons will do
to this city or to this country

  
It rushed back in

  
So you know nuclear weapons are 

  
in a way they also until now
preserved the peace of the world

  
I belong to the school of thought
that if it was not for nuclear weapons

  
we would have had the Third World War

  
between the Soviet Union
and the United States and NATO

  
sometime in the s or 's

  
That nuclear weapons actually
until today served a good function

  
It's because of nuclear weapons

  
that we did not have any more
direct clashes between superpowers

  
because it was obvious
that this would be collective suicide

  
But the danger is still there
it's always there

  
If there is miscalculation

  
then the results could of course

  
be existential catastrophic

  
BG And at the same time you know
in the 's after Cuba and Berlin

  
and so in the 's but in the 's

  
we started building a sort of
international institutional architecture

  
that helped reduce the risk of military
confrontation of nuclear weapons

  
we used you know anything
from arms control agreements

  
to measures designed to build trust
or to communicate directly and so on

  
And then in the last decade or so

  
that has been progressively
kind of scrapped

  
so we are even in a more
dangerous situation

  
than we were let's say
at the end of the last century

  
YNH Completely I mean

  
we are now reaping
the bad fruits of neglect

  
that's been going on for several years

  
not just about nuclear
weapons but in general

  
about international institutions
and global cooperation

  
We’ve built in the late th century

  
a house for humanity

  
based on cooperation

  
based on collaboration

  
based on the understanding

  
that our future depends
on being able to cooperate

  
otherwise we will become
extinct as a species

  
And we all live in this house

  
But in the last few years we stopped 

  
we neglected it we stopped repairing it

  
We allow it to deteriorate more and more

  
And you know eventually it will 

  
It is collapsing now

  
So I hope that people will realize
before it's too late

  
that we need not just
to stop this terrible war

  
we need to rebuild the institutions

  
we need to repair the global house
in which we all live together

  
If it falls down we all die

  
BG So we have
among the audience listening

  
Rola from 

  
I don't know where she's from
she grew up in Lebanon 

  
and she said "I lived the war
I slept on the ground I breathed fear

  
All the reasons were explained to me
that the only remaining learning came

  
the war is absurd

  
We talk about strategy power budgets
opportunities technologies

  
What about human suffering
and psychological trauma"

  
Especially I assume what she's asking
is what about what's going to remain

  
in terms of the human suffering

  
and the psychological trauma
going forward

  
YNH Yeah I mean
these are the seeds of hatred

  
and fear and misery

  
that are being planted right now
in the minds and the bodies

  
of tens of millions
hundreds of millions of people really

  
Because it's not just
the people in Ukraine

  
it's also in the countries around
all over the world

  
And these seeds will give
a terrible harvest

  
terrible fruits in years
in decades to come

  
This is why it's so crucial
to stop the war immediately

  
Every day this continues
plants more and more of these seeds

  
And you know like this war now

  
its seeds were to a large extent

  
planted decades and even centuries ago

  
That part of the Russian fears
that are motivating Putin

  
and motivating people around him

  
is memories of past invasions of Russia

  
especially of course
in Second World War

  
And of course it's a terrible mistake

  
what they are doing with it

  
They are recreating again the same things
that they should learn to avoid

  
But yes these are still
the terrible fruits

  
of the seeds being planted in the s

  
BG It's what in same article you call

  
the fact that nations
are ultimately built on stories

  
So these seeds are the stories
we are starting to create now

  
The war in Ukraine
is starting to create the stories

  
that are going to have an impact
in the future that's what you're saying

  
YNH Some of the seeds of this war
were planted in the siege of Leningrad

  
And now it gives fruit
in the siege of Kyiv

  
which may give fruit
in  or  years in more terrible 

  
We need to cut this we need to stop this

  
You know as a historian

  
I feel sometimes ashamed
or responsible I don't know what

  
about what history the knowledge
of history is doing to people

  
In recent weeks I have been watching
all the world leaders talking with Putin

  
and very often he gave them
lectures on history

  
I think that Macron had a discussion
with him for five hours

  
and afterwards said “Most of the time
he was lecturing me about history”

  
And as a historian I feel ashamed

  
that this is what my profession
in some way is doing

  
I know it for my own country

  
In Israel we also suffer
from too much history

  
I think people should be
liberated from the past

  
not constantly repeating
it again and again

  
You know everybody should
kind of free themselves

  
from the memories of the Second World War

  
It's true of the Russians

  
it's also true of the Germans

  
You know I look at Germany now

  
and what I really want to say
if there are Germans watching us

  
what I really want to say to the Germans

  
guys we know you are not Nazis

  
You don't need to keep
proving it again and again

  
What we need from Germany now
is to stand up and be a leader

  
to be at the forefront
of the struggle for freedom

  
And sometimes Germans are afraid
that if they speak forcefully

  
or pick up a gun

  
everybody will say
"Hey you're Nazis again"

  
No we won't think that

  
BG That's happening right now

  
I mean lots of things that were
inconceivable just  days ago

  
have happened in the last few weeks

  
And one of the most striking
to me in any case

  
is Germany's reaction and transformation

  
I mean the new chancellor
Olaf Scholz the other day announced

  
that Germany will send arms to Ukraine

  
and will spend an extra  billion
dollars in building up its army

  
That reverses completely the principles

  
that have guided Germany's foreign policy

  
and security politics for decades

  
So that shift is happening exactly
at this moment and very very fast

  
YNH Yeah

  
And I think it's a good thing

  
We need the Germans to 

  
I mean they are now
the leaders of Europe

  
certainly after Britain left in Brexit

  
And we need them to in a way

  
let go of the past and be in the present

  
If there is really
one country in the world

  
that as a Jew as an Israeli
as a historian

  
that I trust it not to repeat
the horrors of Nazism

  
that's Germany

  
BG Yuval I want to touch
quickly on three things

  
that have to do with the fact
that this feels like

  
the first truly interconnected
war in many ways

  
The first of course is the basics

  
which is on one side
you have a very ancient war 

  
we have tanks and we have trenches
and we have bombed buildings 

  
and on the other we have
realtime visibility of everything

  
through cell phones and Twitter
and TikTok and so on

  
And you have written a lot
about this tension

  
between old ways and new tech

  
What's the impact here

  
YNH First of all we don't know
everything that is happening

  
I mean surprisingly with all this
TikTok and phones and everything

  
so much is not known

  
So the fog of war is still there and yes

  
there is much more information
but information isn’t truth

  
Lots of information is disinformation
and fake news and so forth

  
And yes it’s always like this;

  
the new and the old they come together

  
You know with all the talk
about interconnectedness

  
and living in cyberspace and all that

  
one of the most important technologies
not just of this war

  
but of the last decade or two
have been stone walls

  
It's Neolithic

  
Everybody is now building stone walls

  
in the era of Facebook
and Google and all that

  
So the old and the new they go together

  
And it's 

  
It is a new kind of war

  
People are sitting at home
in California or Australia

  
and they actively participate in the war

  
not just by writing tweets

  
but by attacking websites
or defending websites

  
You know in Spain in the Civil War

  
if you wanted to help fight fascism

  
then you had to go to Spain
and join the international brigade

  
Now the international brigade
is sitting at home in San Francisco

  
and is still in some way part of the war

  
So this is definitely new

  
BG So indeed just two days ago
Ukraine's deputy prime minister I think

  
Fedorov announced via Telegram

  
that he wanted to create
a sort of volunteer cyber army

  
He invited software developers and hackers

  
and other people with IT skills

  
to somehow help Ukraine
fight on the cyber front

  
And according to “Wired” magazine
in less than two days

  
 people signed up

  
So here is a defending nation
that can kind of recruit almost overnight

  
 volunteers
to go to battle on his behalf

  
It's a very different kind of war

  
YNH Yeah

  
You know every war brings it surprises

  
Sometimes it's how everything is new

  
but sometimes it's also
how everything is old

  
BG So a few people in the chat
and in the Q and A have mentioned China

  
which of course
is an important actor here

  
although for now is mostly an observer

  
But China has a stated policy
of opposing any act

  
that violates territorial integrity

  
So moving into Ukraine of course
violates territorial integrity

  
And it also has a huge interest
in a stable global economy

  
and global system

  
But then it needs to square this
with the recent closeness with Russia

  
Xi Jinping and Putin met in Beijing
before the Olympics for example

  
and kind of had this message of friendship
that went out to the world

  
How do you read China's position
in this conflict

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean I'm not an expert on China

  
and I certainly can't just 

  
You know just reading the news
won't get you into the mindset

  
into the real opinions and positions
of the Chinese leadership

  
I hope that they take
a responsible position

  
And act 

  
because they are close to Russia

  
they are also close to Ukraine

  
but especially because
they are close to Russia

  
they have a lot of influence on Russia

  
I hope that they will be
the responsible adults

  
that will put down the flames of this war

  
They have a lot to lose

  
from a breakdown of the global order

  
And I think they have a lot to win
from the return of peace

  
including in terms of the gratitude
of the international community

  
Now whether they do it or not
this is with them

  
I can't predict but I hope so

  
BG You have mentioned before
the several European and Western leaders

  
that have gone to Moscow
in the weeks before the invasion

  
Varun in the chat asks

  
"Is the Ukraine war
a failure of diplomacy"

  
Could have 

  
Something different happened

  
YNH Oh you can understand it
in two questions

  
Did diplomacy fail to stop the war

  
Absolutely everybody knows that

  
But is it a failure in the sense
that a different diplomatic approach

  
some kind of other proposition
would have stopped the war

  
I don't know but it doesn't seem like it

  
I mean looking at the events
of the last few weeks

  
it doesn't seem that Putin
was really interested

  
in a diplomatic solution

  
It seemed that he was really
interested in the war

  
and I think again
it goes back to this basic fantasy

  
that if he really was concerned
about the security situation of Russia

  
then there was no need
to immediately invade Ukraine

  
There was no immediate threat to Russia

  
There was no discussion of right now
Ukraine joining NATO

  
There was no invasion army assembling
in the Baltic states or in Poland

  
Nothing

  
Putin chose the moment
to start this crisis

  
So this is why it doesn't seem

  
that it's really
about the security concerns

  
It seems more about this very deep fantasy

  
of reestablishing the Russian Empire

  
and of denying the very existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
BG So you live in the Middle East

  
Someone else in the chat asks

  
"What makes the situation so unique

  
compared to many other wars
that are going on right now in the world"

  
I would say aside from the nuclear
threat from Russia but what else

  
YNH Several things

  
First of all

  
we have here again something
we haven't seen since 

  
which is a dominant power

  
trying to basically
obliterate from the map

  
an independent country

  
You know when the US invaded Afghanistan

  
or when the US invaded Iraq

  
you can say a lot of things about it

  
and criticize it in many ways

  
There was no question
of the US annexing Iraq

  
or turning Iraq into the st state
of the United States

  
This is what is happening in Ukraine

  
under this pretext or this disguise

  
this is what's at stake

  
The real aim is to annex Ukraine

  
If this succeeds

  
again it brings us back
to the era of war

  
I was struck by what
the Kenyan representative

  
to the UN Security Council said
when this erupted

  
The Kenyan representative spoke
in the name of Kenya

  
and other African countries

  
And he told the Russians

  
Look we also are the product
of a postimperial order

  
The same way the Soviet empire collapsed
into different independent nations

  
also African nations came out
of the collapse of European empires

  
And the basic principle
of African politics ever since then

  
was that no matter what your objections

  
to the borders you have inherited

  
keep the borders

  
The borders are sacred

  
because if we start invading
neighboring countries because

  
"Hey this is part of our countries

  
these people are part of our nation"

  
there will not be an end to it

  
And if this now happens in Ukraine

  
it will be a blueprint for copycats
all over the world

  
The other thing which is different
is that we are talking about superpowers

  
This is not a war
between Israel and Hezbollah

  
This is potentially a war
between Russia and NATO

  
And even leaving aside nuclear weapons

  
this completely destabilizes
the peace of the entire world

  
And again I go back again
and again to the budgets

  
That if Germany doubles
its defense budget

  
if Poland doubles its defense budget

  
this will spread to every
country in the world

  
and this is terrible news

  
BG So Yuval I'm jumping
from topic to topic

  
because I want to use the last few minutes

  
to ask a few questions from the audience

  
A few people are asking
about the link to the climate crisis

  
particularly when it relates
to the energy flows

  
Like Europe is very dependent

  
part of Europe is very dependent
on Russian oil and gas

  
which is as far as we know
still flowing until today

  
But could this crisis
in a sort of paradoxical way

  
a bit like the pandemic
accelerate climate action

  
accelerate renewables and and so on

  
YNH This is the hope

  
That Europe now realizes the danger

  
and starts a green Manhattan Project

  
that kind of accelerates
what already has been happening

  
but accelerates it

  
the development of better energy sources

  
better energy infrastructure

  
which would release it
from its dependence on oil and gas

  
And it will actually undercut
the dependence of the whole world

  
on oil and gas

  
And this would be the best way
to undermine the Putin regime

  
and the Putin war machine

  
because this is what Russia has

  
oil and gas

  
That's it

  
When was the last time you bought
anything made in Russia

  
They have oil and gas

  
and we know you know the curse of oil

  
That oil is a source of riches

  
but it’s also very often
a support for dictatorships

  
Because to enjoy the benefits of oil

  
you don't need to share it
with your citizens

  
You don't need an open society

  
you don't need education
you just need to drill

  
So we see in many places

  
that oil and gas are actually
the basis for dictatorships

  
If oil and gas if the price drops

  
if they become irrelevant

  
it will not only undercut the finance

  
the power of the Russian military machine

  
it will also force Russia

  
force Putin or the Russians
to change their regime

  
BG OK let me bring up a character

  
that everybody here in the chat
seems to find quite heroic

  
and that's the Ukrainian president

  
So Ukraine kind of finds itself

  
with a comedian who turned
almost accidental president

  
who turned now war president

  
But he has shown an impressive conduct
in the last few weeks

  
especially in the last few days

  
which can be summarized
in that response he gave to the US

  
when they offered
to kind of exfiltrate him

  
so he could lead a government in exile

  
he said "I need ammunition
I don't need a ride"

  
How would you look at President Zelenskyy

  
YNH His conduct
has indeed been admirable

  
and he gives courage and inspiration
not just to the Ukrainian people

  
but I think to everybody around the world

  
I think to a large extent

  
the swift and united reaction of Europe

  
with the sanctions
and sending arms and so forth

  
to a large extent this is also
to the credit of Zelenskyy

  
That you know

  
when politicians are also human beings

  
And his direct appeal to them

  
and you know they met him
many times in person

  
and to see where he is now

  
and the threat that not only him
but his family is also in

  
And you know they talk with him

  
and he says and they know
that this may be the last time they speak

  
He may be dead murdered or bombed
in an hour or in a day

  
It really changes something

  
So in this sense I think he made
a huge personal contribution

  
to not just the reaction in Ukraine
but around the world

  
BG So Sam who’s listening
asked this question

  
"Can you provide some historical context

  
for the force and the meaning
of economic and trade sanctions

  
at the level where they are
currently imposed

  
How have previous wouldbe empires
wouldbe aggressors or aggressors

  
been constrained by such
isolations and such sanctions"

  
YNH You know what we need
again to realize about Putin's Russia

  
is that it's not the Soviet Union

  
It's a much smaller and weaker country

  
It's not like in the s

  
that in addition to the Soviet Union

  
you had the entire Soviet bloc around it

  
So it's easier in this sense
to isolate it

  
It's much more vulnerable

  
Again does it mean that sanctions
would work like a miracle

  
and stop the tanks No

  
It takes time

  
But I think that the West is in a position

  
to impact Russia

  
with these kinds of sanctions
and isolation much more

  
than let's say with the Soviet Union

  
And also the Russian people are different

  
The Russian people
don't really want this war

  
even the people in the immediate
circle around Putin

  
You know again

  
I don't know them personally
from what it seems

  
it's that these people they like life

  
They have their yachts
and they have their private airplanes

  
and they have their house in London

  
and they have their chateau in France

  
And they like the good life

  
and they want to keep enjoying it

  
So I think that the sanctions
can be really effective

  
What's the timetable

  
That's ultimately in the hands of Putin

  
BG So Gabriella asks “I remember
the war in former Yugoslavia

  
and the atrocities there

  
Is there any possibility that this war
would escalate into such a situation"

  
I think an extension to that is

  
Is this war kind of stirring
dormant conflicts

  
like in the Balkans for example

  
or in the former Central Asian republic

  
YNH Unfortunately it can get
to that level and even worse

  
If you want an analogy go to Syria

  
You look at what happened in Homs

  
At what happened in Aleppo

  
And this was done by Putin
and his airplanes

  
and his minions in Syria

  
It's the same person behind it

  
And to think that "No no no
this happened in the Middle East

  
It can't happen in Europe"

  
No

  
We could see Kyiv
in the same situation as Homs

  
as the same situation as Aleppo

  
which would be catastrophic

  
and again would plant
terrible seeds of hatred

  
for years and decades

  
So far we've seen
hundreds of people being killed

  
Ukrainian citizens being killed

  
It could reach tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands

  
So in this sense it's extremely
painful to contemplate

  
And this is why we need again and again

  
to urge the leaders to stop this war

  
and especially again and again

  
tell Putin

  
"You will not be able
to absorb Ukraine into Russia

  
They don't want it they don't want you

  
If you continue

  
the only thing you will achieve
is to create terrible hatred

  
between Ukrainians and Russians
for generations

  
It doesn't have to be like that"

  
BG Yuval let me finish
with one question about your county

  
You are in Israel

  
Israel has close ties
with both Russia and Ukraine

  
It's actually home of many Russianborn
and many Ukrainianborn Jews

  
How is the country reacting
to this conflict

  
I'm talking about the government
but also about the population

  
YNH Actually I'm not
the best person to ask

  
I've been so kind of following
what's happening around the world

  
I didn't pay so much attention
to what is happening right here

  
And even though I live here

  
I'm not an expert on Israeli society
or Israeli politics

  
Definitely the sentiment in the street
in the social media is with Ukraine

  
You see Ukrainian flags

  
you see on social media
people putting Ukrainian flags

  
on their accounts

  
And another thing
so many people in Israel

  
they came from the former Soviet Union

  
And until now

  
everybody was simply known as Russians

  
You know even if you came from Azerbaijan
or you came from Bukhara

  
you were a Russian

  
And suddenly "No no no no no

  
I'm not Russian

  
I'm Ukrainian"

  
And again these seeds of hatred
that Putin is planting

  
it's reaching also here

  
That suddenly people are saying
no Russian Ukrainian

  
until a very short time ago
it's the same thing

  
No it's not the same thing

  
So the shock waves are spreading

  
BG Yuval thank you for taking the time
and being with us today

  
and sharing your knowledge
and your views on the situation

  
Thank you very much

  
YNH Thank you
and I hope for peace quickly

  
BG We all do Thank you

Bruno Giussani It's difficult
to think clearly

  
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
because wars while they unfold

  
they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog

  
Information is abundant

  
the millions of refugees

  
the shocking suffering
and the destruction the politics

  
But sense is lacking

  
And that's going to be the focus
of this Membership conversation

  
as we enter the third week of the war

  
We won’t talk about the events of the day

  
but try to project a longer arc
a broader context

  
Our guest is geopolitical
analyst Ian Bremmer

  
He's the founder
and president of Eurasia Group

  
and we asked him to lay the scene

  
by talking first
about the geopolitical shifts

  
that have already been brought
by the war in Ukraine

  
And after we're going to have
a conversation

  
including questions from TED Members
who are participating in this call

  
Ian welcome

  
Ian Bremmer Thank you very much

  
I'll start by saying that in my lifetime

  
the most important geopolitical artifact
is the fall of the Berlin Wall

  
I mean you see it

  
if you go into the new
NATO headquarters in Brussels

  
just built a few years ago

  
And anyone that has a piece
something they're very proud of

  
they know it affected their entire lives

  
I think that in  years' time

  
and I fear that in  years' time

  
if we look back

  
a second most important
geopolitical artifact

  
will be a piece of the rubble
of the Maidan in Kyiv

  
I believe that the war
that we are seeing right now

  
is no more and no less

  
than the end of the peace dividend

  
that we all thought we had

  
when the wall came down in 

  
The idea that the world could focus
more on globalization

  
and goods and services
and people and ideas

  
going faster and faster across borders

  
leading to unprecedented growth
in human development

  
and a global middle class

  
I think that this is a tipping point

  
Won't end globalization

  
but it does end the peace dividend

  
It does mean that the Europeans overnight

  
will and must prioritize
spending on defense policy

  
on national security
coordination on NATO

  
And the speech that was given
by Olaf Scholz

  
the new chancellor two weeks ago

  
in my view the most significant speech
given by a European leader

  
in the postCold War environment

  
precisely because it's now
the postpostCold War environment

  
sending weapons to the Ukrainians

  
committing to over two percent
of GDP spend on defense

  
investing in a new fund
for defense infrastructure

  
But also recognizing that the way

  
that the Germans
and the Europeans as a whole

  
looked at the world
and looked at themselves was

  
unfortunately for all of us outdated

  
A few other points I'd like to raise
just to kick off this conversation

  
One

  
One of the reasons
I'm pretty negative about this

  
and I'm not usually very negative
I'm usually an existential optimist

  
I’m someone that’s just happy
there’s water in the glass

  
But when I look at this conflict
I’m much more concerned

  
And that is because I do not
see a scenario

  
a plausible scenario
in the foreseeable future

  
where Putin emerges from this war

  
in anything less than a radically
weakened position

  
compared to where he was
before he announced the invasion

  
And I believe that both in terms
of his domestic political orientation

  
how stable he is in his own country

  
also of course
Russia's economic position

  
and finally Russia's position
in terms of global security

  
and European security

  
ostensibly the very reason that Putin
began the war to begin with

  
Second big point is that the decoupling
that we are seeing from Europe

  
and the United States with Russia
is in my view permanent

  
And that would be true even if there were
a negotiated settlement

  
and all the Russian troops
were to pull out of Ukraine

  
and we had peace

  
I still think that a lot
of those companies would not come back

  
with Putin in power

  
I'm convinced that the decisions
by the Europeans

  
to ramp up their national security
capabilities will be permanent

  
Permanent deployments coming
in the Baltic states for example

  
forward deployments in Poland
and Bulgaria and Romania

  
And also an unwind of Europe’s
massive energy dependence

  
coal oil and most importantly gas

  
on Russia

  
That does not make Russia a global pariah

  
because you can't be a global pariah

  
if the soontobe most important
economy in the world China

  
is actually your bestie
on the global stage

  
and that indeed continues to be true

  
despite China's efforts
to portray themselves

  
towards Europe at least

  
as more neutral

  
We are going to see the Russians
as a supplicant economically

  
in terms of energy flows

  
financially in terms of transactions

  
and technologically
perhaps most important

  
aligned with China

  
That has big geopolitical
implications longterm

  
Also a lot of other developing
economies like the Indians

  
like the Gulf states like Brazil

  
are also not going to work
with Russia as a pariah

  
They'll continue to engage

  
Are there any silver linings

  
And I think there are a few

  
Of course there is a much greater
renewed purpose and mission of NATO

  
I mean this is an organization
that just a couple of years ago

  
France President Emmanuel Macron
referred to as “braindead”

  
It was increasingly drifting
in terms of its importance

  
The Americans were focusing
much more on Asia the pivot

  
Not today

  
Today NATO is purposeful

  
it's aligned it's consolidated

  
it's going to get more
resources not less

  
That's also true of the European
Union as a whole

  
even when we talk about countries
like Hungary and Poland

  
that have been much less aligned
in terms of rule of law

  
in terms of an independent judiciary

  
much more aligned in terms
of the importance

  
of common values of Europe

  
compared to that of what
we're seeing in Moscow

  
I mentioned the German security
and policy shift

  
The UKEU relationship is much
smoother and more functional

  
than at any point since Brexit
process actually started

  
And even the United States

  
I mean if you watched
the State of the Union

  
for a brief moment in time
five or  minutes

  
when all of the Democrats and Republicans
were standing and applauding together

  
you could be forgiven for believing
that the United States

  
had a functional representative democracy

  
Now I'm not sure how long
this is going to last

  
but at least as of now

  
leaders of the Democratic
and Republican Party

  
see Putin as much more
of a threat an enemy

  
than they do their opponents
across the aisle in domestic politics

  
And two weeks ago that was not true

  
That's significant

  
Final silver lining
and I wish it was more of one

  
but the Chinese

  
as much as they are strategically
aligned with Russia

  
and with the person of President Putin

  
they do not want a second Cold War

  
And they would rather
a negotiated settlement

  
They're not willing to push
very hard for it

  
But they certainly do not see
a radical decoupling of the Russian

  
and potentially the Chinese economy

  
from the rest of the world from Europe

  
from the US from the advanced
industrial democracies

  
as in any way in their interest

  
And ultimately that does create
at least some buffer

  
some guardrail on how much this is likely
to escalate as a conflict going forward

  
BG I want to make a step back
and unpack some of that

  
maybe starting with a question
that relates to your last point

  
and is probably on the mind of many

  
And it is

  
Is there still some real
space for negotiation

  
Is there still a potential relationship
between Russia and Ukraine

  
IB The foreign ministers of Russia
and Ukraine just met recently in Turkey

  
It was as much of a nonevent

  
as the three preceding negotiations
of more junior representatives

  
of their teams on the Belarus border

  
The one thing that has been
accomplished to a small degree

  
has been humanitarian corridors

  
extending out of a number
of Ukrainian cities

  
that are being pounded
by Russian military

  
That's because the Ukrainians are
interested in protecting their civilians

  
and the Russians are interested
in taking a lot of territory

  
without necessarily having to kill
so many Ukrainians

  
that could cause problems
for them internationally

  
as well as domestically inside Russia

  
But that is nowhere close
to a negotiated settlement

  
Now I mean everyone I know

  
that's involved
in the negotiations right now

  
responds that the President Putin himself
is hellbent on taking Kyiv

  
and on removing Zelenskyy from power

  
Now I think and by the way
they're getting quite close

  
to being able to accomplish that
militarily on the ground

  
I think within the next couple of weeks
certainly it looks very likely

  
A couple of points here

  
One there is no reason to put
any stock in anything

  
that the Russians are saying publicly
in terms of their diplomacy

  
They lied to the face
of every world leader

  
about the invasion that they said
they were not going to do into Ukraine

  
And then just today

  
Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov publicly said

  
well the Russians didn't attack Ukraine

  
I mean this is Orwellian stuff right

  
So first of all do not report
on Russian public statements

  
as if they bear any semblance
to reality on the ground

  
Secondarily this looks like a huge
loss for Putin right now

  
He understands it and I think
he would have a hard time

  
even with his control of information
spinning this to his public

  
without removing Zelenskyy

  
without the “deNazification”
as he calls it 

  
which is an obscenity in an environment

  
where the Ukrainian president
is actually Jewish 

  
the disarmament of Ukraine

  
and of course the ability of the Russians

  
to change how they feel about Ukraine
as a threat to the Russian homeland

  
BG What level of support
can we give Ukraine militarily

  
intel economic

  
before Putin considers
taking a strike on a NATO country

  
IB Well it’s interesting the way
you framed that Bruno

  
Because I mean

  
I think that Putin is already considering
strikes on NATO countries

  
I mean there were massive attacks

  
cyberattacks and disinformation attacks

  
by Russia against NATO countries
with reckless abandon

  
over the course of the past years

  
And in fact when President Biden
met with Putin in Geneva back in June

  
it seems like years
and years ago at this point

  
Biden set the agenda

  
Ukraine was largely not discussed

  
but what was discussed was cyberattacks
on critical infrastructure

  
Because you may remember Bruno

  
that meeting came right after
the cyber attacks

  
against the Colonial Pipeline

  
And the Russians after that
indeed pulled back

  
on supporting those attacks
by their criminal cyber syndicates

  
I expect those attacks to restart
in very short order

  
against NATO countries

  
I also believe that the fact that the West
is sending weapons to Ukraine

  
and is providing realtime
intelligence reports

  
on the disposition of Russian troops
on the ground in Ukraine

  
to better allow the Ukrainians
to defend themselves

  
and blow the Russians up

  
that is considered by the Russians
to be an act of war

  
and they will retaliate

  
And how they retaliate is the question

  
I don't think they're going to send
troops into Poland

  
But you know

  
when the Americans under Reagan
were providing that kind of support

  
to the mujahideen

  
to help them defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan

  
the Soviets saw that as an act of war

  
and they engaged in acts of terrorism
against the mujahideen in Pakistan

  
And I absolutely think
that that is on the table

  
in terms of front line
NATO countries especially

  
like Poland like the Baltic states
like Bulgaria Romania

  
Would that be considered
an Article V attack

  
Would that force NATO countries
to strike the Russians back

  
I'm not sure it would

  
Not directly not militarily

  
So I mean I do think that the fact
that the NATO countries see

  
there is some sort of a big red line
between sending troops in for example

  
and doing a nofly zone
because that could cause World War III

  
but everything short of that
is just a proxy war

  
The Russians don't see it that way

  
And that gives the Russians
some advantage tactically

  
in terms of their willingness to escalate

  
BG You're describing a spiral
of escalation here

  
that will touch the globe
and not only Ukraine

  
not only the eastern flank of Europe

  
which means that not only this war
has ripple effects everywhere

  
but this is also starting
a sort of realignment

  
of the global geopolitical
situation and context

  
To me it has been very striking
how Europe and the US

  
have kind of moved very fast
in a cohesive way

  
And it has chosen after years
of prioritizing the economics

  
in their international
and global dealings

  
it's chosen to put politics over markets

  
It has adopted sanctions
that will hurt Russia

  
but will also hurt Western businesses

  
It’s the discussion about decoupling
that you put forward before

  
an active kind of fencing out
of the Russian economy

  
Talk to us about how do you see
this decoupling playing out

  
IB Yeah I mean I do think
that for the Europeans

  
this is a permanent move

  
I mean I've spoken to top leaders
in the German government

  
who tell me that Nord Stream
was a strategic mistake

  
and they understand it

  
Who say that you know

  
Scholz making this speech
from the Social Democratic Party

  
on the center left

  
is the equivalent of Nixon going to China

  
No one else could have made that move

  
But having made it everyone is on board

  
The popularity in Germany

  
even given the massive
economic consequences

  
is extraordinary and is across the board

  
And what they need to do now

  
is ensure that the diversification
of fossil fuels in the near term

  
away from Russia

  
towards Qatar and Azerbaijan
and even you know

  
sort of the United States for LNG

  
can be done as fast as humanly possible

  
And that further even though
it’s going to cost a lot

  
some of it will be uneconomic

  
the move towards renewables
actually picks up and is faster

  
The Italians Mario Draghi

  
I think his shift in strategic
orientation that they will do

  
this is his "whatever it takes" moment

  
He had that in response
to the  financial crisis

  
as the head of the European Central Bank

  
and that made him “Super Mario”

  
This is making him Super Mario
as the Italian prime minister

  
This is the "whatever it takes"
moment for the Italians

  
who never make public statements
that undermine their economic

  
their commercial interests
like this in such a strategic way

  
The French of course
have less to be concerned about

  
in the sense that most of their energy
comes from nuclear power and is domestic

  
So they are not as affected directly
by a cutoff from Russia

  
And also because Macron fancies himself

  
especially as the leader
of the European Commission this year

  
the rotating leadership
occupying the presidency

  
but also with his elections coming up

  
and just given his personal belief
that he can drive diplomacy

  
I believe that even after Kyiv falls

  
and after Zelenskyy
is either killed or forced out

  
that the Americans will not want
to engage in direct diplomacy

  
the Germans probably won't

  
The French will

  
And by the way the Chinese will too

  
And I do believe
that there is a potential

  
and this is a danger
for the cohesiveness of the West

  
that the Chinese and Macron end up being
the postKyiv Normandy format

  
of diplomacy

  
That's something that the Americans
and the Germans right now

  
are starting to worry about quite a bit

  
Now that's the European shift

  
And I think as I said
I think it's permanent

  
I believe the UK is in that camp as well

  
I'm not so sure the United States
is going to be as committed

  
for as long a term

  
It doesn't affect the Americans
as much economically

  
it doesn't affect the Americans as much
in terms of a direct security issue

  
None of those refugees are coming
to the United States

  
But also American inequality

  
American political polarization
and dysfunction is so much greater

  
than what you experience
on the continent in Europe

  
So the potential that in six months' time
or in two years' time

  
as we're thinking about the  election

  
that the Americans have largely forgotten
about this Russia issue instead

  
are focusing once again
on domestic political opponents

  
as principal adversaries

  
which deeply undermines NATO

  
much more than anything
that would come from the Europeans

  
I think that is a real
open question going forward

  
that is perhaps as significant
as the question of where the Chinese go

  
BG Let me pick up on the point
you made about energy

  
because somehow Putin's calculus
can really change

  
if Russian oil and gas
stops flowing to Europe

  
if it becomes part
of the sanctions right

  
And this war indeed can kind of be read

  
as a war about energy

  
Selling energy funds it for Russia

  
being dependent on Russian energy makes
the European response more constrained

  
Rising energy insecurity
rising energy cost

  
may or probably will destabilize
European politics and economy

  
in the coming months

  
How would you look at this
from the perspective of energy

  
and is there any likelihood

  
that Russian oil and gas
is going to stop flowing

  
either because Putin cuts it
or the Europeans sanction it

  
IB Yeah or because it's blown up
in some of the transit in Ukraine

  
I mean keep in mind

  
so much of the gas transit
is going through large pipeline networks

  
which have some redundancy
across all of Ukraine

  
But there's a big war
that's going on right there

  
and lots of people that could have
incentive to create problems

  
The Americans of course the Canadians

  
have said that they're cutting off
oil import from Russia

  
but those are nominal numbers

  
so they don't matter very
much to the markets

  
The Europeans as I said

  
want to decouple themselves
as quickly as possible

  
but they believe that doing that this year
would be economic suicide

  
So there isn't despite everything
we see from Russia

  
they're using thermobaric weapons now
against the Ukrainian people

  
the Americans are warning

  
that they could use chemical
biological weapons against Ukraine

  
I mean you know
you even have some people saying

  
what if they use
a tactical nuclear weapon

  
I mean 

  
God willing none of these
things come to pass

  
But it is very hard to see
a military scenario in Ukraine

  
that leads the Europeans

  
to completely cut off their inbound gas
from Russia this year

  
It's very hard to see

  
And also I would say it's very hard
to see any level of economic sanction

  
that would change the mind of the Russians

  
in terms of their military decision making

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now I think there are a lot of things
that the West is doing

  
in terms of providing weapons
for the Ukrainians

  
that are having an impact on the ground

  
A lot more Russians are getting killed

  
It won’t prevent them
from taking to Kyiv again in my mind

  
I feel quite confident about that

  
But it's quite possible
perhaps even likely

  
that the west of Ukraine
will remain in Ukrainian hands

  
which means that you know
after this fighting is "over"

  
that a rump Ukrainian state in exile
exists in the West run by Zelenskyy

  
or someone that's aligned with him

  
and that they continue to get
enormous economic and military support

  
from all of the NATO countries

  
So even though I don't think

  
that the energy situation
will become so parlous

  
that it would affect
Putin's decision making

  
I do think that the West's response
does matter on the ground

  
BG The war is kind of having radiating
economic shock waves around the world now

  
ripple effects on food markets
for example and food security

  
We talk a lot about energy security

  
what about food security

  
IB Well you have the largest
grain producer in the world

  
invading the fifth largest
grain producer in the world

  
on the back of a twoyear pandemic
that's still ongoing

  
We don't talk about it much anymore
but it's still there

  
And of course this hit the poorest
countries in the world the hardest

  
The level of indebtedness

  
and the unsustainability
of paying that debt off

  
was already becoming a massive problem

  
for so many of the developing
countries in the world

  
And the IMF provided a lot of relief
in special drawing rights and direct aid

  
over the course of the past  months

  
but that money is now running to an end

  
And what happens
when commodity prices spike up

  
and we have severe supply chain challenges
with energy and food

  
and those things
are obviously very related

  
What happens is that a lot of people die

  
What happens is we see
a lot more starvation

  
The World Food Organization says about 
million people a year die of starvation

  
That number in the next  months
is going to be a lot higher

  
than it otherwise would have been

  
The number of people
who are food stressed in the world

  
is going to go way up
in subSaharan Africa in Yemen

  
in Afghanistan in Bangladesh

  
It's going to go way up

  
And you know
it's horrible to think about

  
but the massive impact
of this Russia crisis

  
is going to be much more
global inequality

  
And this is of course

  
a direct consequence of the end
of the peace dividend more structurally

  
That over the last  years
of globalization

  
what did you have

  
A lot of people were left behind

  
but the biggest thing you had

  
was the explosion of a single
global middle class

  
On the back of the pandemic

  
and now this RussiaUkraine war

  
and the decoupling of the Russian
economy from the West

  
which doesn't matter so much in terms
of the size of the Russian economy

  
but it matters immensely in terms
of commodities globally and supply chain

  
those two things are going
to seriously unwind

  
the growth of this global middle class

  
and they're going to stress developing
countries to a much greater degree

  
They will lead to financial crises
in countries like Turkey for example

  
that will no longer be able
to service their debt

  
You'll see more Lebanons out there

  
You'll see some in Latin America
you'll see some in subSaharan Africa

  
Those are the knockon effects and so

  
so many people that have been saying
over the last few weeks

  
"Why are we paying so much
attention to Ukraine

  
It's because they're white people
because they're European

  
We wouldn't pay that much attention
if they were Afghans

  
or if they were you know Afghanis
or if they were Yemenis

  
We wouldn't"

  
I mean first of all you've got millions
and millions of Ukrainian refugees

  
and we're not paying
as much attention to them

  
as we did to the Syrian refugees
precisely because of race

  
precisely because the Europeans
are more willing to integrate

  
millions and millions
of "fellow Europeans" into Europe

  
But we are paying much more attention
to the Ukraine crisis and we should

  
because the impact on the poorest
people around the world

  
is vastly greater

  
from this conflict
than anything that we've seen

  
in any of those smaller economies
with less impact

  
despite all of the human depredation
that’s happened over the past  years

  
BG Ian I want to talk
for a second about climate

  
because another crisis that has kind of
disappeared from the headlines

  
is the climate crisis right

  
Ten days ago the IPCC released a report

  
that the secretary general
of the UN described

  
as an "atlas of human suffering"

  
if I remember correctly

  
And it has been basically ignored

  
Over the last several years

  
much of the world had started to embark
with more or less enthusiasm

  
on a process of transitioning
away from oil and gas

  
and into kind of a clean energy future

  
And now the war comes in

  
and we look at what you just described
the unraveling of global supply chains

  
the dependency on energy and so on

  
And there are kind of two
schools of thought here

  
One says this war is going to accelerate
the adoption of clean energy

  
because we need to diminish dependence
from Russia and these fossil fuels

  
And the other says
the other school of thought says

  
it's going to derail
the transition to clean energy

  
because suddenly the priority
is no longer decarbonization

  
suddenly the priority
is energy security energy supply

  
IB The Europeans
are largely in the first camp

  
and they will move towards faster
decoupling and investment accordingly

  
The Americans are largely
in the second camp

  
and they will move towards

  
"Let's focus more on fossil fuels
and partisan divide on this issue"

  
accordingly

  
The Chinese

  
who are the largest carbon emitter
in the world by a long margin

  
though not per capita
and not historically

  
but still in terms of every year totals

  
they will continue on the same
path they've been on

  
which is a netzero target

  
but without yet a very strong plan
on how to get there

  
and not feeling a lot of pressure
to provide that plan

  
because they think the Americans
are completely incoherent

  
and incapable of effectuating
a strategic longterm plan

  
on climate themselves

  
So I mean what we have is a lot
of progress on climate and of course

  
technology around renewable energies
and around electric batteries

  
and supply chain

  
continue to get cheaper and cheaper

  
as more money is being invested in it

  
And that does make me longterm
more optimistic that by 

  
a majority of the world's energy
will probably be coming from renewables

  
And five years ago
I wouldn't have said that

  
But still I mean when the news today

  
is that the Americans are sending
a highlevel delegation to Caracas

  
to figure out if we can reopen
relations with Venezuela

  
to get them to produce more oil again

  
With the Iranians

  
let's do any deal possible to get back
into the JCPOA the nuclear deal

  
so that we can get that oil on the market

  
Calling the Saudis calling the Emiratis

  
and they’re not willing to take
Biden’s phone call on this issue

  
while they're talking to Putin

  
Those are warning signals
that in the near term

  
we've got some big challenges

  
and a lot of those challenges are going
to be filled with fossil fuels

  
and fossil fuel development

  
And so I do think that the fact

  
that both of the answers to your question
are true in different places

  
on netnet is more negative
for how quickly we can transition

  
BG Let's talk a bit about China

  
Brigid I think
who’s listening in asks

  
"What do you believe
Xi Jinping is learning

  
from the world's response
to the crisis to the Ukrainian war"

  
IB Well certainly learning that this
was a red line for the West

  
And I think that this
would have surprised

  
it obviously surprised Putin

  
I think it would have surprised
Xi Jinping as well

  
Xi Jinping saw Afghanistan

  
He saw that Merkel was out

  
He saw that Macron is focused
on strategic autonomy

  
He sees Biden as much more focused
on China and Asia

  
I think that this
is a surprise to Xi Jinping

  
But Xi Jinping also sees

  
that a lot of the world
is not with NATO on this issue

  
 countries if I remember correctly

  
voted to censor the Russians
for their invasion of Ukraine

  
at the United Nations General Assembly

  
But very large numbers of that 

  
are not on board with all
of these sanctions against Russia

  
They're happy with the diplomatic censure

  
but they need to continue
to work with the Russians

  
The Chinese see that too

  
The Chinese see just how much more
fragmented the global order is

  
I thought the most significant thing
that we've seen from the Chinese so far

  
two issues

  
The first is of course
when Putin went to Beijing

  
and Xi Jinping made
the public announcement

  
that “this is our best friend
on the global stage

  
and we will work much more strategically
with them economically

  
diplomatically and militarily
going forward"

  
And Xi Jinping knew very well
where Ukraine was heading at that point

  
and also knew that the likelihood
of an invasion was coming

  
Didn't stop him from making
that announcement in the slightest

  
And then after the invasion
and it's going badly

  
I mean if you watch Chinese social media

  
the fact is that the censorship
is all about Ukraine

  
I mean the Chinese media space

  
is pursuing a relentlessly
proPutin policy

  
They have media embedded
with Russian troops

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now publicly the Chinese
government wants to be seen

  
as “We’re neutral we like the Russians

  
we like the Ukrainians

  
we still want to work with everybody"

  
But the fact is that China
feels no problem

  
being publicly completely
aligned with Putin

  
despite the fact that they are invading
a democratic government

  
with  million people
in the middle of Europe

  
That's a pretty astonishing
statement from the Chinese

  
And there's no question
that they have learned

  
that they're in a vastly better
economic position than they used to be

  
and that gives them influence

  
They are a government
who projects its power

  
primarily through economic
and technological means

  
as opposed to Russia that projects it
primarily through military means

  
And the Chinese believe

  
that there is a level of decoupling
that is already going on

  
as the Americans focus
on more industrial policy

  
as they focus on America first
for American workers

  
A US foreign policy for the American
middle class as Biden put it

  
is one that really pushes a lot of capital
to leave a country like China

  
which had served
as the factory for the world

  
but at the expense of a lot of labor

  
coming out of advanced
industrial economies

  
And now yes there are
definitely some dangers

  
that come from the Chinese being perceived
as too close to Russia

  
and they won't want that

  
and they'll want to make sure
that they're engaging diplomatically

  
with the Europeans
to try to minimize that damage

  
But I thought it was very interesting

  
and I'm not sure this is public yet

  
that the Chinese ambassador to Russia
recently in the last few days

  
organized a meeting of a lot
of the top investors

  
Chinese investors in Russia saying

  
"This is a unique opportunity
the West is leaving

  
we should be going in and doing more

  
Because they're going to be completely
reliant on us going forward"

  
That is not a message
that the Chinese ambassador delivers

  
unless he is told
directly to from Beijing

  
BG Ian I'm going to jump
from topic to topic

  
because there are several
questions in the chat

  
Nancy is asking about whether Putin
can be removed from power

  
There's been a lot of discussion lately
about regime change in Russia

  
either endogenous like a palace coup

  
or provoked by sanctions
and other policies

  
And so she asks

  
"How likely is that Putin will face
a challenge from inside Russia

  
whether a popular uprising
a coup or other"

  
IB It's very very unlikely
until it happens

  
(Chuckles)

  
I mean in the sense
that there is absolutely no purpose

  
in trying to say oh I mean you know

  
there are rumors that Defense Minister
Shoigu is unhappy and you know

  
he might be making a move

  
And I’ve seen these
from relatively credible analysts

  
I'm like no no
if there are such rumors

  
then we know it's not happening

  
because that's the end
of Shoigu and his family

  
But it's very clear that there is more
pressure on Putin now

  
than at any point
since he's been president

  
Domestic pressure on Putin

  
About  Russians
have been arrested so far detained

  
most of them have been released

  
for nonviolent antiwar protests

  
The Russians have shut down
all the Western media

  
They've shut down all the Russian
opposition and independent media

  
So Putin has control of the space

  
though if you look at Russian
conversations on Telegram

  
you'll still see a bunch of people
that are seriously seriously antiwar

  
But you know once the economy
starts truly imploding

  
and you can't find goods on shelves
in Russia in major cities

  
and this is coming you know very soon
this is a matter of days

  
in many of these cities

  
those demonstrations
will likely become greater

  
some of them can become violent

  
You know that'll increase the pressure

  
Then you have the issue of how
the Russians are fighting on the ground

  
I mean what happens
if you get a lot of desertions

  
We haven't seen that so far

  
What happens if you get
orders to bomb Kyiv

  
and a whole bunch of Russian
fighter pilots bomber pilots

  
decide not to and they defect
to Poland to Germany

  
That would have a big impact on morale

  
That has not happened so far

  
I mean do be aware of the fact

  
that the Ukrainians are winning
the war on information

  
and that means that the information
that you are getting in the West

  
about the war

  
is much more proUkrainian 

  
morale enthusiasm

  
how well the military is doing 

  
than what's actually
happening on the ground

  
And also be aware of the fact

  
that the Russians completely control
the war on information inside Russia

  
BG Exactly

  
IB They're not getting a balanced view

  
They're getting a completely
proPutin view

  
And most of them actually believe it

  
in the same way that most people
that voted for Trump in the US

  
believe that the election was stolen
and Trump is still president

  
I mean it's much worse
in Russia in that regard

  
than it is in the United States

  
and I think that that's
underappreciated in the West

  
So even though I think there's pressure

  
I really don't think
that it's super likely

  
that Putin is out anytime imminently

  
BG Ed is asking whether you see
any offramp for Putin

  
IB I think that the most likely offramp
for Putin is after Kyiv is taken

  
and Zelenskyy is removed
one way or the other

  
at that point

  
the possibility of the Russians
accepting a frozen conflict

  
or a cease fire that could lead
to ongoing negotiations

  
is a lot higher

  
because Putin can sell that as a win
back home much more easily

  
But also because further
Russian attacks at that point

  
serve much less purpose for the Russians

  
are much harder to bring about

  
and potentially have much more
negative consequences

  
So for me that would be
the nearterm potential break

  
where we could at least freeze issues
largely where they are

  
Now whether that could then eventually
lead to a climbdown or not

  
I mean the Russians have been very happy
with frozen conflicts on their borders

  
for years and years and years

  
I'm thinking about NagornoKarabakh
between Armenia and Azerbaijan

  
which basically stayed in place
until the Azeris

  
over the course of a decade
got enough military capacity

  
that they could forcibly change
the situation on the ground

  
Which by the way the Ukrainians might
also be eventually thinking about

  
because the West will be supplying them
with advanced weapons all the way through

  
I'm thinking South Ossetia in Georgia

  
I'm also of course thinking
about the two pieces of Ukraine

  
they took back in 

  
So be aware of the fact that a negotiation
that creates a cease fire

  
does not mean you're anywhere
close to a resolution

  
or an end of the fighting
that we're seeing

  
BG Someone else in the chat
who didn't sign by his or her name

  
is asking about the nuclear fear
that hangs over the conflict

  
How should we think of that

  
IB Yeah we don't like it
when Putin uses the Nword

  
and there's no question

  
I mean he and his direct reports
have rattled nuclear sabers

  
on at least five times
that I've seen in the past few weeks

  
I think that 

  
In  I wasn't alive
we had the Cuban Missile Crisis

  
There was a real possibility
of nuclear confrontation

  
between the world's two superpowers

  
At least for the last  years
there’s been no chance of that

  
Functionally no chance of that

  
I think we're now back in a world

  
where a Cuban Missile Crisis
is again a reality

  
Now that doesn't mean that I think
nuclear war is likely or imminent

  
I don't

  
And in fact

  
there is active deconfliction
going on even today

  
the Americans and Russians
with a new hotline

  
the secretary general of the UN

  
with the Russian defense minister

  
engaging in deconfliction
measures with UN

  
offices being invited to Moscow

  
So as bad as it is right now

  
people that have been
doing this for a long time

  
are trying to avoid nuclear war

  
But that's the point

  
Is we're now in a situation

  
where the conflict
that we're going to experience

  
needs to be actively managed

  
because of the danger
of nuclear confrontation

  
So it now becomes a risk on the horizon
that we must be continually aware of

  
even if only at a low level

  
as we take and consider further actions

  
as we consider diplomacy

  
as we consider escalation

  
It is now on the table in a way
that frankly is so debilitating

  
I mean as human beings all on this call

  
one of the most painful
things to think about

  
is the fact that we still have
these  nuclear warheads in Russia

  
and  the United States
that are still pointed at each other

  
and they still have the potential
to destroy the planet

  
And we haven't had any real
lessons that we've been able to learn

  
institutionally from 

  
BG  being a generic figure
not the exact figure

  
but we are kind of
in that order of magnitude

  
Then of course there is the question
of civilian nuclear

  
so the two power plants
nuclear power plants

  
that have been seized by the Russians

  
One has been slightly damaged by a bomb

  
the other has been turned off

  
But those are also potentially gigantic
nuclear problems just waiting to happen

  
IB Chemical weapons biological weapons

  
I mean look we have had two million
refugees from Ukraine in two weeks

  
As this continues you're looking
at five to  million refugees

  
I mean it is hard 

  
Just take a step for a moment
just as a human being

  
Imagine what it would take for a quarter
of your country's population

  
to say “I am not living here anymore

  
I am leaving everything
because of the condition of the country

  
because of this unjust war

  
that has been imposed upon you
by your neighbor"

  
That's what we're looking at

  
And again it's important
for us to you know

  
not lose the humanity of this crisis

  
and the extraordinary hardship

  
that is being visited
upon  million Ukrainians

  
that have done nothing wrong
they have committed no sin

  
other than their desire to have
an independent country

  
BG One other country

  
that has not yet taken
a very clear position is India

  
IB Well they're a member of the Quad

  
and their relationship with China
is pretty bad and that’s mutual

  
But in terms of Russia

  
there's been a longstanding relationship

  
trade relationship defense relationship

  
between India and Russia

  
that the Russians
are not going to jettison

  
and they see no reason to jettison it

  
And as long as you've got a whole bunch
of other countries out there

  
that are substantial
that are willing to say

  
we're going to keep playing ball
with the Russians

  
then the Indians will too

  
And that's why you've got the abstention
in the United Nations vote

  
And that's why you've had
very careful comments

  
as opposed to overt
and strong condemnation

  
coming from the Indian leadership

  
BG Phil in the chat is asking

  
"Will this cause a fragmentation
of the financial system

  
with kind of a Western system
and an Eastern system”

  
So two different SWIFTlike systems
two different credit card systems

  
crypto what's the role
of crypto in all this

  
IB I hope not

  
I mean I will tell you
that before the invasion started

  
if you talk to most Western CEOs

  
and I'm talking across
the entire sweep of sectors

  
so it's finance and it's manufacturing
and its services and it's tech

  
most of them would have told you
that they did not in any way plan

  
on reducing their footprint in China

  
and a lot of them said

  
that China was their most important
growth market in the world

  
Not a surprise

  
China is going to be the largest
economy in the world in 

  
So you know a world
that you're decoupling

  
is not a good world

  
when China is going to be
number one economically

  
I mean that obviously
is going to hurt the West in a big way

  
So there are strong
incentives against that

  
and there remain very strong
and powerful entrenched interests

  
in the United States and Europe
that will resist direct decoupling

  
Despite the fact that there are
these more incremental moves

  
towards friendsourcing and insourcing

  
because you know
Chinese labor is more expensive

  
you don’t need as much labor
to get capital moving

  
given robotics

  
and big data deep learning
all of those things

  
But I do think that the Russia conflict

  
risks a level of secondorder decoupling

  
Because if the Russians end up
financially integrated with China

  
in their own

  
notaseffective SWIFT system

  
and all of their energy
ends up going to China

  
and the Chinese build that infrastructure
and they get a discount on it

  
and Russia's technology and their military
industrial complex gets serviced

  
by Chinese semiconductors
and Chinese componentry

  
well I do think that there will be
knockon decoupling

  
that will be longer term
and more strategic

  
from the United States from the Europeans

  
and even from Japan and South Korea

  
So that is a worry

  
and I think the Chinese
are highly aware of that

  
And over the coming months
they will do everything they can

  
both with the Europeans in particular

  
but also I expect at least
with some of the Asian economies

  
to try to limit the impact of that

  
Now keep in mind

  
we haven't talked at all
about Asia yet outside of China

  
The new Japanese Prime Minister Kishida
is at least as hawkish

  
in his orientation towards
China and Russia as Abe was

  
He is providing support
for the Ukrainians

  
including some military capacity 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
He's allowing Ukrainian refugees 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
And yesterday the South Koreans
had a very very tight election

  
and Yoon is now in charge

  
He is on the right and he is the guy
that is strongly antiChina

  
was talking about South Korea
having nuclear capabilities

  
wants a new THAAD missile
defense system for the South Koreans

  
and wants to rebuild
the relationship with Tokyo

  
That matters

  
And that's a big strategic change
in the geopolitical map

  
that will look more problematic
on the decoupling front

  
from Beijing's perspective

  
BG Three final quick questions
that all come from the chat Ian

  
One is because you mentioned
the rest of Asia outside of China

  
"What about the rest of the world

  
What about Africa and Latin America

  
How do they factor into this
conversation or don't they"

  
IB They factor in

  
I mean those that have
significant commodities do well

  
because the prices
are going to be so high

  
Those that don't are going to be
under massive pressure

  
for reasons we already talked about

  
but they are not going to be forced
to pick a side on this one

  
I just don't see it

  
In the same way that if you were Colombia
in the last couple of years

  
you know you found

  
even though you're working very closely
with an American ally

  
you're still dealing with Huawei and G

  
This is knockon effects of all of this

  
These are countries
that are not going to take on

  
significant economic burden

  
given how much they're suffering
right now geopolitically

  
BG Another one is about sanctions

  
How do we even know when and how

  
at what point we start
rolling back sanctions

  
IB I think that as long
as Ukraine is occupied

  
by the Russian government

  
for the foreseeable future
and Putin is there

  
I can't see these sanctions
getting unwound

  
Now if a rump Ukrainian government
that is democratically elected

  
were prepared to sue for peace
and retakes most of Ukraine

  
but they give away Crimea
and they give away the Donbass

  
could you see in that environment
some of these sanctions unwound

  
Sure

  
But I mean I am suggesting

  
that I think that many of these sanctions
are functionally permanent

  
They reflect a new way of doing business

  
And when people ask me
what’s going to happen when this is over

  
my response is what do you mean over

  
What's over is the peace dividend

  
We are now in a new environment

  
BG And one of the figures
of this new environment

  
and I want to close with that
is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine

  
who was not taken very seriously
when he was elected

  
he has come out as a significant
figure in this war

  
What do you make of President Zelenskyy

  
How do you read this character

  
IB He's very courageous

  
I'm obviously inspired by his ability
to communicate and rally his people

  
and take personal risk in Kyiv
while this invasion is going on

  
But I'm very conflicted

  
because I think many of the steps
that Zelenskyy took

  
in the runup to this conflict

  
actually made the likelihood
of conflict worse

  
He was unwilling to take the advice
of the Americans and Europeans seriously

  
in the months leading up to the conflict

  
He was unwilling to mobilize his people

  
to ready them for
the potential of conflict

  
He was certainly unwilling to give an inch

  
in terms of Ukraine's desire
to be a member of NATO

  
even though he knew completely

  
that no one in NATO was prepared
to offer a membership action plan

  
let alone actually
bring them in as members

  
And part of that is a lack of experience

  
and lack of any business
being in that position

  
in the runup to this crisis

  
So I’m very deeply conflicted
in my personal views on Zelenskyy

  
given the way he behaved
before the invasion

  
compared to the extraordinary leadership
that he has displayed to all of us

  
over the last two weeks

  
BG Ian thank you for taking the time

  
for sharing your knowledge
and your analysis with us

  
We deeply appreciate it
Thank you very much

  
IB Good to see all of you

“Turn the tides

  
We must give back”

  
chant my ancestors

  
The thunder strikes 

  
(Hands clap)

  
as the sea demoness 
swept through the lands

  
with a fiery likeness of Letao’s fire

  
Tearing apart livelihood

  
the mounting waves and erosions
leave my island gaping

  
like the mouth of a dead fish

  
Tense muscles of uncles and aunties

  
that hauled cement for the seawall

  
cooked meals for the hungry bellies

  
Release in relief

  
The tides have gone out

  
I look to my grandparents’ graves

  
intimate with limp seaweeds

  
The disrespect

  
(Marshallese) Iakwe nan aolep

  
My name is Selina Leem

  
At  at the COP 

  
alongside late ambassador
for climate change Tony de Brum

  
I introduced myself
as a small island girl with big dreams

  
Five years later I reintroduced myself

  
as a climate warrior from Aelon Kein Ad

  
the Marshall Islands

  
Situated between Hawaii and Australia

  
our chain of islands decorate
the Pacific Ocean like seashells

  
and they are home to about  people

  
Our islands average about
two meters above sea level

  
and it is not uncommon to see
both the ocean and lagoon side

  
from wherever you stand

  
We say our highest point

  
is the bridge which curves
about seven meters above the sea

  
The massive body of water
is our reality and our livelihood

  
With a history of seafaring

  
the ocean connected our islands together

  
as well as providing
many resources to fish

  
to feed

  
and to adorn our handicrafts
with seashells that we make a living from

  
But the climate crisis has brought
calamities to my people

  
threatening our very livelihoods

  
In the Pacific king tide season
is from November to April

  
This is when the tides
are at their highest

  
and each year the sea level rises

  
In these months especially houses
by the seashore end up flooded

  
or damaged completely

  
Schools and churches have had to open
their doors for community members

  
to come sleep at

  
when announcements come in the radio
advising to find shelter

  
because of incoming tides

  
And we huddled together
with our blankets and pillows

  
no matter that we are strangers
as we sleep next to one another

  
Seawalls are rebuilt
as soon as it’s low tide

  
only to be broken down again

  
by the waves that grow higher each year

  
And these waves

  
their path continues on into the islands

  
bringing with it garbage
we’ve thrown into it

  
You see the graves of your loved ones
submerged in water

  
littered

  
Then the vegetation starts to brown;

  
it is dying

  
The soil becomes salinated

  
You pray the bigger trees hold on

  
for their roots are needed
to prevent further erosion

  
In the most effected parts of the lands

  
the land has regressed

  
coming closer and closer
to the road each year

  
Our driest part of the year happens
within this time period too

  
We are unable to use groundwater well
because it becomes saltier as well

  
In the capital Majuro once per week

  
water is dispensed

  
and my neighbors and I fill up our tanks

  
our water catchments

  
our bottles and our buckets

  
Our government has had to declare
a state of national emergency

  
calling for help from our friends

  
Sealevel rising

  
flooding

  
droughts

  
erosion have been the reality
of my people for many many many years

  
We’ve been told to move

  
To become climate change refugees

  
I’m not even sure
who would even take us in

  
But to those who think
that we can just accept our fate

  
I want to say

  
Adaptation and Indigenous knowledge 
are the solutions

  
These islands are our ancestors

  
our predecessors

  
our homes

  
We are at the risk of losing all of that

  
for something we contributed
very very little to

  
Raising and expanding the islands
is something my country is thinking of

  
However we don’t have the resources
nor the infrastructure

  
Regardless

  
we remain adamant

  
We continue to fight for our livelihoods

  
and not abandon our home

  
Thank you

It’s the morning of June th 

  
and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic  kilometer journey

  
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather

  
flying an average of  kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight

  
Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the DDay invasion back to England

  
He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment

  
Paddy was one of around  pigeons

  
used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages

  
In fact pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices

  
Seeing their meat as a protein source

  
and their nitrogenrich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer

  
humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as  years ago

  
We then tapped into other traits

  
Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct

  
that drives them to navigate
long distances

  
back to the location they consider “home”

  
So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing

  
In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying”

  
people selected for traits 
like head plumage

  
and fabulously feathered feet

  
As we carried pigeons around the world
they escaped or were released

  
forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today

  
Pigeons are now one of the most abundant
widespread species on the planet

  
managing to thrive in chaotic cities

  
They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits

  
including some that were
accentuated by humans

  
Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees

  
pigeons were originally cliffdwellers

  
City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat

  
And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking

  
Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass

  
and it's a great spot to raise babies

  
This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments

  
where more specialized species can’t

  
As generalists pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste

  
With an organ in their throats 
called a crop

  
they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later

  
They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food

  
Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and proteinrich meal

  
If conditions are right
pigeons breed yearround

  
and produce new offspring every six weeks

  
They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities

  
because of the abundance 
of food and shelter

  
These booming populations 
attract predators

  
New York City is home 
to a million pigeons

  
which support large populations
of raptors

  
But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight

  
further exploited by being bred
for racing

  
means they’re made 
for high speed chases

  
Compared to barn owls
which are a similar size

  
pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved

  
providing extra space for muscle mass

  
They can reach speeds 
of  kilometers per hour

  
And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout

  
While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife

  
we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors

  
In  New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings”

  
and it stuck

  
Indeed their poop

  
which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer presents a unique problem

  
Just one pigeon can leave behind 
 kilograms of acidic excrement per year

  
which in the United States 
scales to about $ billion

  
in structural damage annually

  
Though incidents of infection are rare

  
this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled

  
They may be numerous noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch

  
but the pigeons that swirl around us

  
are evidence of an ancient 
ongoing relationship

  
Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort

  
For better or for worse 
we did this to ourselves

  
The world can be a toxic place

  
No one knows this more
than women and girls

  
cis and trans

  
as well as nonbinary people

  
I am a journalist

  
with  years’ experience

  
reporting on the injustices women
and others face around the world

  
I’m a cofounder of the Man Up Campaign

  
to energize youth activism
against sexual and genderbased violence

  
I’m a father to two daughters

  
I’m a life partner to a woman

  
and I’m a Black man in America

  
Holding these identities 

  
and many more 

  
I say this call to action to you

  
with the deepest sincerity

  
and utmost gravity

  
It is time for a gender reckoning

  
beginning with men authentically
confronting our internal selves

  
and each other

  
through the toxicity within us

  
Against the backdrop
of Black Lives Matter protest

  
cries for a racial reckoning
have echoed throughout the world

  
at times seeming premature

  
and largely misunderstood

  
I believe a true gender reckoning
must be the center

  
of any transformative movement
for social justice and equity

  
But what is a reckoning

  
Dictionaries say it means
to resolve a bill or a debt

  
In other words to settle an account

  
In the case of women and girls

  
what is the debt owed to them

  
Who’s to pay it

  
And how

  
The consequences of male toxicity
continue building

  
the debt to which I refer

  
including among others

  
a gender wealth gap most affecting women
who care for their families

  
as well as act as the primary
income generators

  
for their households

  
Today in the United States and abroad

  
threats to reproductive justice endanger
the lives and hardfought rights of women

  
in regards to their bodily
sexual and gender autonomy

  
impacting the most disenfranchised
community in society

  
And violence against women

  
in all of its forms

  
still represents
an existential challenge

  
as we’ve seen domestic violence
rise in the pandemic

  
as people were confined to their homes

  
we’ve seen online and public
harassment flourish

  
unabated

  
The sexual trafficking

  
prostitution

  
exploitation of women and girls
thrives as ever before

  
From where does this toxicity come

  
and why

  
Men are not endangered

  
we’re not under assault

  
we’re not being unfairly maligned

  
In fact it’s men or certain types of
masculinity that are the issue

  
To be clear

  
being a man does not make me

  
or anyone else who identifies as a man

  
inherently toxic

  
But masculinity

  
in certain forms

  
can harm women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
and men

  
through violence

  
dominating power

  
and control

  
So how do we address this

  
How can we men step up

  
and better support our daughters

  
our sisters

  
our female partners

  
our colleagues neighbors and friends

  
Through what means can men both instigate
and lead a gender reckoning

  
First we must tell the truth

  
We must tell the truth

  
Men grow into this world
becoming who we’re expected to be

  
or who we think we’re expected to be

  
based on cultural expectations

  
and inaccurate historical narratives

  
As a short chubby Black kid
wearing glasses growing up

  
I was repeatedly told I cried too much

  
I’m too emotional

  
too soft

  
It was ingrained in me
that to prove my masculinity

  
I had to display physical prowess 

  
intimidation

  
Because of that indoctrination

  
as an adult

  
I refused to seek help
facing escalating health challenges

  
including high blood pressure

  
and mental trauma

  
The archetype of manhood nearly killed me

  
I say that as a survivor
of two heart attacks

  
four years on dialysis

  
and a kidney transplant 

  
aside from the physical risk
I put myself into

  
covering wars around the world

  
The injury we do to ourselves

  
and the women around us

  
comes from fear of losing control

  
of lack of external affirmation

  
and simply out of shame

  
Manhood is a spectrum of identities

  
There is no one way to be a man

  
And sometimes discovering one’s true
manhood is a lifelong journey

  
Secondly

  
we must be consistent

  
Men

  
especially men of color

  
cannot expect women to stand up for us

  
with us in the face
of systemic oppressions

  
when too often we do not
do the same for them

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
(Applause)

  
The Black Lives Matter
movement for example

  
founded named and led
by queer women of color

  
still centers Black men’s wellbeing

  
in the face of unfair policing

  
and criminal justice systems

  
And where’s the reciprocal
support from those men

  
including myself

  
in addressing intercommunity violence
against women of color

  
maternal health inequity

  
economic disparity

  
How and where do men show up for women

  
I wonder 

  
how many men stood with women
on the steps of the US Supreme Court

  
as they fought for reproductive rights

  
How many men should have been there

  
Finally there can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
There can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
Men who commit acts of violence against
women must be held accountable

  
by formal systems of justice

  
as well as other men

  
Silence in the face of misogynistic
behavior and language is complicity

  
We men need to break free from the pack

  
take concrete actions to stop violence

  
create safety

  
and build equity

  
And most importantly

  
say something

  
To be sure

  
bold men around us are actively working
to disrupt the narrative of male toxicity

  
After the  earthquake in Haiti

  
a local organization

  
KOFAVIV

  
invited men to be defenders of women
and girls in displacement camps

  
women and girls who were
at risk of sexual assault

  
Scores of men answered the call

  
and can continue to do so today

  
In New York City

  
CONNECT NYC

  
led by a Black man

  
actively engages community partners
across civil society

  
to address family violence

  
And in a profession not known generally
for its advocacy against gender violence

  
a professional player
for the Washington Football Team

  
has become an unabashed advocate

  
for men to learn

  
and actively change behaviors
regarding sexual and physical violence

  
There is hope;

  
there is light

  
Men around the world
are putting in the work

  
to catalyze a true gender reckoning

  
But far more are needed

  
What I want to say to you today is this

  
Too many of us 

  
too many men 

  
don’t understand

  
that equity

  
justice

  
inclusivity

  
safety for women girls
and nonbinary people

  
serves and saves us all

  
Broken masculinity harms societies

  
full stop

  
When we men reckon with that truth

  
we will finally find our shared humanity

  
Women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
men

  
standing together on equal footing

  
with mutual respect

  
in safe environments

  
is the greatest
gender reckoning we can create

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Imagine a scientist

  
who wants to send a robot
to explore in a faraway place

  
a place whose geography
might be completely unknown

  
and perhaps inhospitable

  
Now imagine that instead
of first designing that robot

  
and sending it off in the hope
that it might be suitable

  
instead she sends
a robotproducing technology

  
that figures out what kind of robot
is needed once it arrives

  
builds it and then enables it
to continue to evolve

  
to adapt to its new surroundings

  
It’s exactly what my collaborators
and I are working on

  
a radical new technology
which enables robots to be created

  
reproduce and evolve
over long periods of time

  
a technology where robot design
and fabrication becomes a task

  
for machines rather than humans

  
Robots are already all around us
in factories in hospitals in our home

  
But from an engineer's perspective

  
designing a shelfstacking robot
or a Roomba to clean our home

  
is relatively straightforward

  
We know exactly what they need to do

  
and we can imagine the kind of situations
they might find themselves in

  
So we design with this in mind

  
But what if we want
to send that robot to operate

  
in a place that we have little
or even no knowledge about

  
For example cleaning up legacy waste
inside a nuclear reactor

  
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
mining for minerals deep in a trench
at the bottom of the ocean

  
or exploring a faraway asteroid

  
How frustrating would it be
if the humandesigned robot

  
that had taken years
to get to the asteroid

  
suddenly found it needed to drill a hole

  
to collect a sample or clamber up a cliff

  
but it didn't have the right tools

  
or the right means of locomotion to do so

  
If instead we had a technology

  
that enabled the robots to be designed
and optimized in situ

  
in the environment
in which they need to live and work

  
then we could potentially save
years of wasted effort

  
and produce robots
that are uniquely adapted

  
to the environments
that they find themselves in

  
So to realize this technology
we've been turning to nature for help

  
All around us

  
we see examples of biological species

  
that have evolved smart adaptations

  
that enable them to thrive
in a given environment

  
For example in the Cuban rainforest

  
we find vines that have evolved leaves

  
that are shaped like
humandesigned satellite dishes

  
These leaves direct bats to their flowers

  
by amplifying the signals
that the bats send out

  
therefore improving pollination

  
What if we could create
an artificial version of evolution

  
that would enable robots
to evolve in a similar manner

  
as biological organisms

  
I'm not talking about biomimicry

  
a technology which simply copies
what's observed in nature

  
What we're hoping to harness
is the creativity of evolution

  
to discover designs
that are not observed here on Earth

  
the human engineer
might not have thought of

  
or even be capable of conceiving

  
In theory

  
this evolutionary design technology
could operate completely autonomously

  
in a faraway place

  
But equally it could be guided by humans

  
Just as we breed plants for qualities
such as drought resistance or taste

  
the human robot breeder could guide
artificial evolution to producing robots

  
with specific qualities

  
For example

  
the ability to squeeze
through a narrow gap

  
or perhaps operate at low energy

  
This idea of artificial evolution
imitating biological evolution

  
using a computer program

  
to breed better and better solutions
to problems over time

  
isn't actually new

  
In fact artificial evolution

  
algorithms operating inside a computer

  
have been used to design everything
from tables to turbine blades

  
Back in 

  
NASA even sent a satellite into space
with a communication antenna

  
that had been designed
by artificial evolution

  
But evolving robots
is actually much harder

  
than evolving passive objects
such as tables

  
because robots need brains
as well as bodies

  
in order to make sense of the information
in the world around them

  
and translate that
into appropriate behaviors

  
So how do we do it

  
Surprisingly evolution only needs
three ingredients

  
a population of individuals which
exhibit some physical variations;

  
a method of reproduction

  
in which offspring inherit
some traits from their parents

  
and occasionally acquire
new ones via mutation;

  
and finally a means of natural selection

  
So we can replicate these three
ingredients to evolve robots

  
using a mixture of hardware and software

  
The first task is to design
a digital version of DNA

  
That is a digital blueprint that describes
the robot's brain its body

  
its sensory mechanisms
and its means of locomotion

  
Using a randomly generated
set of these blueprints

  
we can create an initial population
of  or more robots

  
to kickstart this evolutionary process

  
We've designed a technology
that can take the digital blueprint

  
and turn it into a physical robot
without any need for human assistance

  
For example it uses a D printer
to print the skeleton of the robot

  
and then an automated assembly arm
like you might find in a factory

  
to add any electronics and moving parts

  
including a small computer
that acts as a brain

  
And to enable this brain to adapt
to the new body of the robot

  
we send every robot produced
to an equivalent of a kindergarten

  
a place where the newborn robot
can refine its motor skills

  
almost like a small child would

  
To mimic natural selection

  
we score these robots
on the ability to conduct a task

  
And then we use these scores

  
to selectively decide
which robots get to reproduce

  
The reproduction mechanism

  
mixes the digital DNA
of the chosen parent robots

  
to create a new blueprint
for a child robot

  
that inherits some of the
characteristics from its parents

  
but occasionally also
exhibits some new ones

  
And by repeating the cycle of selection
and reproduction over and over again

  
we hope that we can breed
successive generations of robots

  
where just like is often observed
in biological evolution

  
each generation gets better than the last

  
with the robots gradually optimizing
their form and their behavior

  
to the task and the environment
that they find themselves in

  
Now although this can all take place

  
in a time frame that's much faster
than biological evolution

  
which sometimes takes thousands of years

  
it's still relatively slow in terms
of the time frames we might expect

  
in our modern world

  
to design and produce an artifact

  
It's mainly due
to the D printing process

  
which can take more
than four hours per robot

  
depending on the complexity
and the shape of the robot

  
But we can give our artificial
evolutionary process a helping hand

  
to reduce the number of physical robots
that we actually need to make

  
We create a digital copy
of every robot produced

  
inside a simulation in a computer

  
and we allow this virtual
population of robots to evolve

  
Now it's quite likely that the simulation
isn't a very accurate representation

  
of the real world

  
But it has an advantage that it enables
models of robots to be created

  
and tested in seconds rather than hours

  
So using the simulator technology

  
we can quickly explore the potential
of a wide range of robot types

  
of different shapes and sizes
of different sensory configurations

  
and quickly get a rough estimate
of how useful each robot may be

  
before we physically make it

  
And we predict that by allowing
a novel form of breeding

  
in which a physical robot can breed
with one of its virtual cousins

  
then the useful traits
that have been discovered in simulation

  
will quickly spread into
the physical robot population

  
where they can be further refined in situ

  
It might sound like science fiction

  
but actually there's a serious point

  
While we expect the technology
that I've just described

  
to be useful in designing robots

  
for example to work in situations
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
or to help us pursue our scientific quest
for exoplanetary exploration

  
there are some more pragmatic reasons

  
why we should consider
artificial evolution

  
As climate change gathers pace

  
it is clear that we need a radical rethink

  
to our approach to robotic
design here on Earth

  
in order to reduce
that ecological footprint

  
For example

  
creating new designs of robot
built from sustainable materials

  
that operate at low energy

  
that are repairable and recyclable

  
It's quite likely that this
new generation of robots

  
won't look anything like the robots
that we see around us today

  
but that's exactly why
artificial evolution might help

  
Discovering novel designs by processes
that are unfettered by the constraints

  
that our own understanding
of engineering science

  
imposes on the design process

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Around the globe

  
there are approximately  million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

  
to escape war violence and persecution

  
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons

  
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries

  
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries

  
They are commonly referred to as refugees

  
But what exactly does that term mean

  
The world has known refugees 
for millennia

  
but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's  Convention

  
relating to the status of refugees

  
in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War

  
It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality

  
and is unable to return 
to their home country

  
because of wellfounded fears
of being persecuted

  
That persecution may be due to their race
religion nationality

  
membership in a particular social group
or political opinion

  
and is often related to war and violence

  
Today roughly half the world's refugees
are children

  
some of them unaccompanied by an adult

  
a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor

  
or sexual exploitation

  
Each refugee's story is different

  
and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes

  
But before we get 
to what their journeys involve

  
let's clear one thing up

  
There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms

  
"migrant" and "refugee"

  
"Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country

  
for reasons not related to persecution

  
such as searching 
for better economic opportunities

  
or leaving droughtstricken areas
in search of better circumstances

  
There are many people around the world
who have been displaced

  
because of natural disasters

  
food insecurities

  
and other hardships

  
but international law rightly or wrongly

  
only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees

  
So what happens when someone
flees their country

  
Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous

  
with limited access to shelter
water or food

  
Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected

  
belongings might be left behind

  
and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents

  
like visas to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries

  
Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling

  
by standard routes

  
This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea

  
and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers

  
to help them cross borders

  
Whereas some people seek safety
with their families

  
others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind

  
with the hopes of being reunited later

  
This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long

  
While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities

  
sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp

  
usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments

  
Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures

  
offering shortterm shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home

  
be integrated to the host country

  
or resettle in another country

  
But resettlement and longterm 
integration options are often limited

  
So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years

  
and sometimes even decades

  
Once in a new country the first legal
step for a displaced person

  
is to apply for asylum

  
At this point they are an asylum seeker

  
and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted

  
While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee

  
every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum

  
and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee

  
Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially

  
Host countries have several duties

  
towards people they have 
recognized as refugees

  
like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and nondiscrimination

  
The most basic obligation towards refugees
is nonrefoulement

  
a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual

  
to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened

  
In reality however refugees are
frequently the victims

  
of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment

  
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia

  
and racism

  
And all too often they aren't permitted
to enter the work force

  
and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid

  
In addition far too many refugee children
are out of school

  
due to lack of funding 
for education programs

  
If you go back in your own family history

  
chances are you will discover that
at a certain point

  
your ancestors were forced 
from their homes

  
either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution

  
It would be good of us to remember
their stories

  
when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced

  
searching for a new home

  
Bruno Giussani We are at the end
of day six of the war in Ukraine

  
or more correctly
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
launched on February 
by President Vladimir Putin

  
We are all shocked
and saddened by the events

  
and by the human suffering
they are causing

  
And as we speak really

  
a Russian military convoy
is headed towards Kyiv

  
other Ukrainian cities
are being bombarded

  
half a million Ukrainians have already
fled to neighboring countries

  
and much more

  
It's still early days

  
and it's difficult to predict
how the situation will evolve

  
even just in the next few hours

  
But this is a war that should concern
everyone everywhere

  
And so today in this TED
Membership conversation

  
we want to try to give it
a broader context with our guest

  
historian and author Yuval Noah Harari

  
Yuval welcome

  
Yuval Noah Harari Hello

  
Thank you for inviting me

  
BG I want to start from Ukraine itself
and its  million people

  
and its particular place
between the East and the West

  
What do we need to know about Ukraine

  
to understand this war
and what's at stake

  
YNH The most crucial thing to know
is that Ukrainians are not Russians

  
and that Ukraine is an ancient
independent nation

  
Ukraine has a history
of more than a thousand years

  
Kyiv was a major metropolis
and cultural center

  
when Moscow was not even a village

  
For most of these thousand years
Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow

  
They were not part
of the same political entity

  
For centuries Kyiv was looking westwards

  
and was a part of a union
with Lithuania and Poland

  
until it was eventually conquered
and absorbed by the Russian Empire

  
by the czarist empire

  
But even after that

  
Ukrainians remained
a separate people to a large extent

  
and it's important to know that

  
because this is really
what is at stake in this war

  
The key issue of the war

  
at least for President Putin

  
is whether Ukraine
is an independent nation

  
whether it is a nation at all

  
He has this fantasy
that Ukraine isn't a nation

  
that Ukraine is just a part of Russia

  
that Ukrainians are Russians

  
In his fantasy

  
Ukrainians are Russians that want
to be back in the fold of Mother Russia

  
and that the only ones preventing it
is a very small gang at the top

  
which he portrays as Nazis

  
even if the president is Jewish;
but OK a Nazi Jew

  
And his belief was at least

  
that he just needs to invade

  
Zelenskyy will flee

  
the government will collapse

  
the army would lay down its arms

  
and the Ukrainian people
would welcome the Russian liberators

  
throwing flowers on them

  
And this fantasy
has been shattered already

  
Zelenskyy hasn’t fled

  
the Ukrainian army is fighting

  
And the Ukrainian people is not throwing
flowers on the Russian tanks

  
it's throwing Molotov cocktails

  
BG So let's unpack that

  
and maybe take the different
pieces one way one

  
So Ukraine has a long history
of being dominated and occupied

  
You mentioned the czar
but also the Soviet Union

  
Hitler's armies

  
It also has a long history of mistrust
of authority and of resistance

  
which goes some way to explain
the current strong resistance

  
that the Russians are encountering

  
Anne Applebaum the journalist
even suggests that this mistrust

  
this resistance to authority

  
is the very essence
of Ukraineness do you agree

  
YNH We did see in the last  years
Ukrainians twice rising in revolt

  
when there was a danger

  
of an authoritarian regime
being established 

  
once in  once in 

  
And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago

  
what really struck me
was this very strong feeling

  
of the desire for independence
and for democracy

  
And I remember walking around this museum

  
of the Revolution of 

  
and seeing these images
like these two elderly women

  
who were bringing sandwiches
to the demonstrators

  
to the fighters

  
They couldn’t throw stones
and they couldn’t do anything else

  
so they prepared sandwiches

  
and brought this huge tray
full of sandwiches

  
to the demonstrators

  
And this yes this is the kind of spirit

  
that inspires not just the Ukrainians

  
but everybody who is now watching
what is happening there

  
BG Help me understand
the actual nature of the threat here

  
in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine

  
So in your last book
when you write about Russia

  
you describe the Russian model as
“not a coherent political ideology

  
but rather a sort of practice
of monopolizing power and wealth

  
by a small group at the top"

  
But then in his actions against Ukraine

  
Putin in the last few weeks seems to move
very much by an ideology

  
an ideology of empire
of denial of Ukraine's right to exist

  
as you mention

  
What has changed in the four years
since you wrote that book

  
YNH The imperial dream was always there

  
but you know empires
are often the creation

  
of a very small gang of people at the top

  
I don’t think the Russian people
[are] interested in this war

  
I don't think that the Russian people
want to conquer Ukraine

  
or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv

  
It's all coming from the top

  
So there is no change there

  
I mean when you look at the Soviet Union

  
you can say that there was
this mass ideology

  
which was shared by a large proportion
or some proportion of the population

  
You don't see this now

  
You know Russia is a very rich country

  
rich in resources

  
but most people are very poor

  
Their standard of living is very very low

  
because all the wealth and power
is kind of sucked

  
by the people at the top

  
and very little is left
for everybody else

  
So I don't think it's a society

  
where the masses are part
of this kind of ideological project

  
They're being ruled from the top

  
And you have this classic
imperial situation

  
when the emperor

  
which controls the largest
country in the world

  
feels that "Hey this is not enough

  
I need more"

  
And sends his army to capture

  
to extend the empire

  
BG I said at the beginning

  
that it's difficult of course
to make predictions

  
But yesterday you published
an article in "The Guardian"

  
titled “Why Putin
has already lost this war”

  
Please explain

  
YNH Well one thing should be very clear

  
I don't mean to say

  
that he's going to suffer
an immediate military defeat

  
He definitely has the military
power to conquer Kyiv

  
and perhaps the whole of Ukraine

  
Unfortunately we might see this

  
But his longterm goal

  
the whole rationale of the war

  
is to deny the existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
and to absorb it into Russia

  
And to do that it's not enough
to conquer Ukraine

  
You also need to hold it

  
And it's all based
on this fantasy on this gamble

  
that most of the population
in Ukraine would agree to this

  
would even welcome this

  
And we already know that it's not true

  
That the Ukrainians
are a very real nation;

  
they are fiercely independent;

  
they don’t want to be part of Russia;

  
they will fight like hell

  
And in the longrun again
you can conquer a country

  
But as the Russians learned
in Afghanistan

  
as the Americans learned
also in Afghanistan also in Iraq

  
it's much harder to hold a country

  
And again the big question mark
before the war was always this

  
Before the war started
many things were already known

  
Everybody knew that the Russian army
is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army

  
Everybody knew that NATO will not send
armed forces into Ukraine

  
troops into Ukraine

  
Everybody knew that the West
the Europeans would be hesitant

  
about imposing too strict
a sanction regime

  
for fear of being hurt by it themselves

  
And this was the basis
for Putin's war plan

  
But there was one big unknown

  
Nobody could say for sure
how the Ukrainian people would react

  
And there was always the option

  
that maybe Putin's fantasy
would come true

  
Maybe the Russians will march in

  
Zelenskyy would flee

  
maybe the Ukrainian army
will just capitulate

  
and the population would not do much

  
This was always an option

  
And now we know this was just fantasy

  
Now we know that the Ukrainians
are fighting they will fight

  
And this derails the whole
rationale of Putin’s war

  
Because you can conquer
the country maybe

  
but you won't be able to absorb
Ukraine back into Russia

  
The only thing he's accomplishing

  
he is planting seeds of hatred

  
in the hearts of every Ukrainian

  
Every Ukrainian being killed

  
every day this war continues
is more seeds of hatred

  
that may last for generations

  
Ukrainians and Russians
didn't hate each other before Putin

  
They’re siblings

  
Now he's making them enemies

  
And if he continues
this will be his legacy

  
BG We're going to talk a bit
about that again later but you know

  
at the same time
Putin needs a victory right

  
The cost the human economic
political cost of this war

  
not even a week in
is already astronomical

  
So to justify it and also
to remain by the way

  
a viable leader at the head of Russia

  
Putin needs to win
and even win convincingly

  
So how do we square these things

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean the fact that you need to win
doesn't mean that you can win

  
Lots of political leaders need to win
and sometimes they lose

  
He could stop the war
declare that he won

  
and say that recognizing
Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians

  
is what he really wanted all along
and he achieved this

  
Maybe they cobble this agreement
or I don’t know

  
This is the job of politicians
I'm not a politician

  
But I can tell you that I hope
for the sake of everybody 

  
Ukrainians Russians
and the whole of humanity 

  
that this war stops immediately

  
Because if it doesn't

  
it's not only the Ukrainians
and the Russians

  
that will suffer terribly

  
Everybody will suffer terribly
if this war continues

  
BG Explain why

  
YNH Because of the shock waves
destabilizing the whole world

  
Let’s start with the bottom line

  
budgets

  
We have been living in an amazing era
of peace in the last few decades

  
And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy

  
You saw it in the bottom line

  
You saw it in the budgets

  
In Europe in the European Union

  
the average defense budget of EU members

  
was around three percent
of government budget

  
And that's a historical miracle almost

  
For most of history

  
the budget of kings and emperors
and sultans like  percent

  
 percent goes to war goes to the army

  
In Europe it’s just three percent

  
In the whole world the average
is about six percent I think

  
factcheck me on this
but this is the figure that I know

  
six percent

  
What we saw already within a few days

  
Germany doubles
its military budget in a day

  
And I'm not against it

  
Given what they are facing
it's reasonable

  
For the Germans for the Poles

  
for all of Europe to double their budgets

  
And you see other countries
around the world doing the same thing

  
But this is you know
a race to the bottom

  
When they double their budgets

  
other countries look and feel insecure
and double their budgets

  
so they have to double
them again and triple them

  
And the money that should go
to health care

  
that should go to education

  
that should go to fight climate change

  
this money will now go to tanks
to missiles to fighting wars

  
So there is less
health care for everybody

  
and there is maybe no solution
to climate change

  
because the money goes to tanks

  
And in this way
even if you live in Australia

  
even if you live in Brazil

  
you will feel the repercussions
of this war in less health care

  
in a deteriorating ecological crisis

  
in many other things

  
Again another very central
question is technology

  
We are on the verge
we are already in the middle actually

  
of new technological arms races
in fields like artificial intelligence

  
And we need global agreement
about how to regulate AI

  
and to prevent the worst scenarios

  
How can we get a global agreement on AI

  
when you have a new cold war
a new hot war

  
So in this field to all hopes

  
of stopping the AI arms race
will go up in smoke if this war continues

  
So again everybody around the world
will feel the consequences in many ways

  
This is much much bigger
than just another regional conflict

  
BG If one of Putin's goals here
is to divide Europe

  
to weaken the transatlantic alliance

  
and the global liberal order

  
he seems to kind of accidentally
have revitalized all of them in a way

  
USEU relations have never been
so close in many years

  
And so how do you read that

  
YNH Well again in this sense
he also lost the war

  
If his aim was to divide
Europe to divide NATO

  
he's achieved exactly the opposite

  
I mean I was amazed by how quick

  
how strong and how unanimous
the European reaction was

  
I think the Europeans
surprised themselves

  
You even see countries like Finland
and Sweden sending arms to Ukraine

  
and closing their airspace

  
They didn't even do it in the Cold War

  
It's really amazing to see it

  
I think another very important thing
is what has been dividing the West

  
over the several years now

  
it’s what people term the “culture war”

  
The culture war between left and right
between conservatives and liberals

  
And I think this war can be an opportunity

  
to end the culture war within the West

  
to make peace in the culture war

  
First of all because you suddenly realize
we are all in this together

  
There are much bigger things in the world

  
than these arguments
between left and right

  
within the Western democracies

  
And it's a reminder
that we need to stand united

  
to protect Western liberal democracies

  
But it's deeper than that

  
Much of the argument
between left and right

  
seemed to be in terms of a contradiction

  
between liberalism and nationalism

  
Like you need to choose

  
And the right goes with nationalism

  
and the left goes more liberalism

  
And Ukraine is a reminder that no
the two actually go together

  
Historically nationalism
and liberalism are not opposites

  
They are not enemies

  
They are friends they go together

  
They meet around the central value
of freedom of liberty

  
And to see a nation fighting
for its survival

  
fighting for its freedom

  
you see it on Fox News
or you see it in CNN

  
And yes they tell the story
a little differently

  
but they suddenly see the same reality

  
And they find common ground

  
And the common ground is to understand

  
that nationalism is not about hating
minorities or hating foreigners

  
it's about loving your compatriots

  
and reaching a peaceful agreement

  
about how we want
to run our country together

  
And I hope that seeing what is happening

  
would help to end
the culture war in the West

  
And if this happens we don't need
to worry about anything

  
You know when you look
at the real power balance

  
if the Europeans stick together

  
if the Americans and
the Europeans stick together

  
and stop this culture war
and stop tearing themselves apart

  
they have absolutely nothing to fear 
the Russians or anybody else

  
BG I'm going to ask you a question later
about the stories the West tells itself

  
but let me zoom out for a second
and get a larger perspective

  
You wrote another essay
last week in “The Economist”

  
and you argue that what's at stake
in Ukraine is and I quote you

  
"the direction of human history"

  
because it puts at risk what you call

  
the greatest political and moral
achievement of modern civilization

  
which is the decline of war

  
So now we are back in a war
and potentially afterwards

  
into a new form of cold war or hot war

  
but hopefully not

  
Elaborate about that essay you wrote

  
YNH Yeah I mean some people think

  
that all this talk
about the decline of war

  
was always just a fantasy

  
But 

  
Again you look at the statistics

  
Since 

  
there has not been a single clash
between superpowers

  
whereas previously in history

  
this was you know
the basic stuff of history

  
Since 

  
not a single internationally
recognized country

  
was wiped off the map
by external invasion

  
This was the common thing in history

  
Until then and then it stopped

  
This is an amazing achievement

  
which is the basis for everything we have

  
for our medical services

  
for education system

  
and this is all now in jeopardy

  
Because this era of peace

  
it wasn't the result of some miracle

  
It wasn't the result of a change
in the laws of nature

  
It was humans making better decisions
and building better institutions

  
which means also

  
that there is no guarantee for the future

  
If humans some humans
start making bad decisions

  
and start destroying
the institutions that kept the peace

  
then we will be back in the era of war

  
with budgets military budgets
going to    percent

  
It can happen

  
It's in our hands

  
And I'll just say one more thing

  
When not just me but other scholars
like Steven Pinker and others

  
talked about the era of peace

  
some people understood it
as kind of encouraging complacency

  
That oh we don't need
to worry about anything

  
No I mean the message
was really the opposite

  
It was a message of responsibility

  
If you think that there is no
era of peace in history

  
it's always war it's always the jungle

  
there is a constant level
of violence in nature

  
then this basically means

  
that there is no point
struggling for peace

  
and there is no responsibility
on leaders like Putin

  
because you can't blame Putin for the war

  
It's just a law of nature
that there are wars

  
When you realize no humans are able
to decrease the level of violence

  
then it should make us
much more responsible

  
And it should also make us understand

  
that the war in Ukraine now
it’s not a natural disaster

  
It’s a manmade disaster
and a single man

  
It's not the Russian people
who want this war

  
There's really just a single person

  
who by his decisions

  
created this tragedy

  
BG So one of the things
that has come back

  
in the last weeks and months
is the nuclear threat

  
It's moved back into the center
of political and strategic considerations

  
Putin has talked about it several times

  
the other day he ordered Russia's
nuclear forces on a higher alert status

  
President Zelenskyy himself
at the Munich Security Conference

  
essentially said that Ukraine
had made a mistake

  
abandoning the nuclear weapons
it had inherited from the Soviet Union

  
That's a statement that I suspect
many countries are pondering

  
What's your thinking about the return
of the nuclear threat

  
YNH It's extremely frightening

  
You know it's like it's almost Freudian

  
it's the return of the repressed

  
We thought that oh nuclear weapons yes

  
there was something
about that in the s

  
with the Cuban Missile Crisis
and Dr Strangelove

  
But no it's here

  
And you know it took just a few days

  
of difficulties on the battlefield

  
for suddenly 

  
I mean I'm watching
television like the news

  
and you have these experts
explaining to people

  
what different nuclear weapons will do
to this city or to this country

  
It rushed back in

  
So you know nuclear weapons are 

  
in a way they also until now
preserved the peace of the world

  
I belong to the school of thought
that if it was not for nuclear weapons

  
we would have had the Third World War

  
between the Soviet Union
and the United States and NATO

  
sometime in the s or 's

  
That nuclear weapons actually
until today served a good function

  
It's because of nuclear weapons

  
that we did not have any more
direct clashes between superpowers

  
because it was obvious
that this would be collective suicide

  
But the danger is still there
it's always there

  
If there is miscalculation

  
then the results could of course

  
be existential catastrophic

  
BG And at the same time you know
in the 's after Cuba and Berlin

  
and so in the 's but in the 's

  
we started building a sort of
international institutional architecture

  
that helped reduce the risk of military
confrontation of nuclear weapons

  
we used you know anything
from arms control agreements

  
to measures designed to build trust
or to communicate directly and so on

  
And then in the last decade or so

  
that has been progressively
kind of scrapped

  
so we are even in a more
dangerous situation

  
than we were let's say
at the end of the last century

  
YNH Completely I mean

  
we are now reaping
the bad fruits of neglect

  
that's been going on for several years

  
not just about nuclear
weapons but in general

  
about international institutions
and global cooperation

  
We’ve built in the late th century

  
a house for humanity

  
based on cooperation

  
based on collaboration

  
based on the understanding

  
that our future depends
on being able to cooperate

  
otherwise we will become
extinct as a species

  
And we all live in this house

  
But in the last few years we stopped 

  
we neglected it we stopped repairing it

  
We allow it to deteriorate more and more

  
And you know eventually it will 

  
It is collapsing now

  
So I hope that people will realize
before it's too late

  
that we need not just
to stop this terrible war

  
we need to rebuild the institutions

  
we need to repair the global house
in which we all live together

  
If it falls down we all die

  
BG So we have
among the audience listening

  
Rola from 

  
I don't know where she's from
she grew up in Lebanon 

  
and she said "I lived the war
I slept on the ground I breathed fear

  
All the reasons were explained to me
that the only remaining learning came

  
the war is absurd

  
We talk about strategy power budgets
opportunities technologies

  
What about human suffering
and psychological trauma"

  
Especially I assume what she's asking
is what about what's going to remain

  
in terms of the human suffering

  
and the psychological trauma
going forward

  
YNH Yeah I mean
these are the seeds of hatred

  
and fear and misery

  
that are being planted right now
in the minds and the bodies

  
of tens of millions
hundreds of millions of people really

  
Because it's not just
the people in Ukraine

  
it's also in the countries around
all over the world

  
And these seeds will give
a terrible harvest

  
terrible fruits in years
in decades to come

  
This is why it's so crucial
to stop the war immediately

  
Every day this continues
plants more and more of these seeds

  
And you know like this war now

  
its seeds were to a large extent

  
planted decades and even centuries ago

  
That part of the Russian fears
that are motivating Putin

  
and motivating people around him

  
is memories of past invasions of Russia

  
especially of course
in Second World War

  
And of course it's a terrible mistake

  
what they are doing with it

  
They are recreating again the same things
that they should learn to avoid

  
But yes these are still
the terrible fruits

  
of the seeds being planted in the s

  
BG It's what in same article you call

  
the fact that nations
are ultimately built on stories

  
So these seeds are the stories
we are starting to create now

  
The war in Ukraine
is starting to create the stories

  
that are going to have an impact
in the future that's what you're saying

  
YNH Some of the seeds of this war
were planted in the siege of Leningrad

  
And now it gives fruit
in the siege of Kyiv

  
which may give fruit
in  or  years in more terrible 

  
We need to cut this we need to stop this

  
You know as a historian

  
I feel sometimes ashamed
or responsible I don't know what

  
about what history the knowledge
of history is doing to people

  
In recent weeks I have been watching
all the world leaders talking with Putin

  
and very often he gave them
lectures on history

  
I think that Macron had a discussion
with him for five hours

  
and afterwards said “Most of the time
he was lecturing me about history”

  
And as a historian I feel ashamed

  
that this is what my profession
in some way is doing

  
I know it for my own country

  
In Israel we also suffer
from too much history

  
I think people should be
liberated from the past

  
not constantly repeating
it again and again

  
You know everybody should
kind of free themselves

  
from the memories of the Second World War

  
It's true of the Russians

  
it's also true of the Germans

  
You know I look at Germany now

  
and what I really want to say
if there are Germans watching us

  
what I really want to say to the Germans

  
guys we know you are not Nazis

  
You don't need to keep
proving it again and again

  
What we need from Germany now
is to stand up and be a leader

  
to be at the forefront
of the struggle for freedom

  
And sometimes Germans are afraid
that if they speak forcefully

  
or pick up a gun

  
everybody will say
"Hey you're Nazis again"

  
No we won't think that

  
BG That's happening right now

  
I mean lots of things that were
inconceivable just  days ago

  
have happened in the last few weeks

  
And one of the most striking
to me in any case

  
is Germany's reaction and transformation

  
I mean the new chancellor
Olaf Scholz the other day announced

  
that Germany will send arms to Ukraine

  
and will spend an extra  billion
dollars in building up its army

  
That reverses completely the principles

  
that have guided Germany's foreign policy

  
and security politics for decades

  
So that shift is happening exactly
at this moment and very very fast

  
YNH Yeah

  
And I think it's a good thing

  
We need the Germans to 

  
I mean they are now
the leaders of Europe

  
certainly after Britain left in Brexit

  
And we need them to in a way

  
let go of the past and be in the present

  
If there is really
one country in the world

  
that as a Jew as an Israeli
as a historian

  
that I trust it not to repeat
the horrors of Nazism

  
that's Germany

  
BG Yuval I want to touch
quickly on three things

  
that have to do with the fact
that this feels like

  
the first truly interconnected
war in many ways

  
The first of course is the basics

  
which is on one side
you have a very ancient war 

  
we have tanks and we have trenches
and we have bombed buildings 

  
and on the other we have
realtime visibility of everything

  
through cell phones and Twitter
and TikTok and so on

  
And you have written a lot
about this tension

  
between old ways and new tech

  
What's the impact here

  
YNH First of all we don't know
everything that is happening

  
I mean surprisingly with all this
TikTok and phones and everything

  
so much is not known

  
So the fog of war is still there and yes

  
there is much more information
but information isn’t truth

  
Lots of information is disinformation
and fake news and so forth

  
And yes it’s always like this;

  
the new and the old they come together

  
You know with all the talk
about interconnectedness

  
and living in cyberspace and all that

  
one of the most important technologies
not just of this war

  
but of the last decade or two
have been stone walls

  
It's Neolithic

  
Everybody is now building stone walls

  
in the era of Facebook
and Google and all that

  
So the old and the new they go together

  
And it's 

  
It is a new kind of war

  
People are sitting at home
in California or Australia

  
and they actively participate in the war

  
not just by writing tweets

  
but by attacking websites
or defending websites

  
You know in Spain in the Civil War

  
if you wanted to help fight fascism

  
then you had to go to Spain
and join the international brigade

  
Now the international brigade
is sitting at home in San Francisco

  
and is still in some way part of the war

  
So this is definitely new

  
BG So indeed just two days ago
Ukraine's deputy prime minister I think

  
Fedorov announced via Telegram

  
that he wanted to create
a sort of volunteer cyber army

  
He invited software developers and hackers

  
and other people with IT skills

  
to somehow help Ukraine
fight on the cyber front

  
And according to “Wired” magazine
in less than two days

  
 people signed up

  
So here is a defending nation
that can kind of recruit almost overnight

  
 volunteers
to go to battle on his behalf

  
It's a very different kind of war

  
YNH Yeah

  
You know every war brings it surprises

  
Sometimes it's how everything is new

  
but sometimes it's also
how everything is old

  
BG So a few people in the chat
and in the Q and A have mentioned China

  
which of course
is an important actor here

  
although for now is mostly an observer

  
But China has a stated policy
of opposing any act

  
that violates territorial integrity

  
So moving into Ukraine of course
violates territorial integrity

  
And it also has a huge interest
in a stable global economy

  
and global system

  
But then it needs to square this
with the recent closeness with Russia

  
Xi Jinping and Putin met in Beijing
before the Olympics for example

  
and kind of had this message of friendship
that went out to the world

  
How do you read China's position
in this conflict

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean I'm not an expert on China

  
and I certainly can't just 

  
You know just reading the news
won't get you into the mindset

  
into the real opinions and positions
of the Chinese leadership

  
I hope that they take
a responsible position

  
And act 

  
because they are close to Russia

  
they are also close to Ukraine

  
but especially because
they are close to Russia

  
they have a lot of influence on Russia

  
I hope that they will be
the responsible adults

  
that will put down the flames of this war

  
They have a lot to lose

  
from a breakdown of the global order

  
And I think they have a lot to win
from the return of peace

  
including in terms of the gratitude
of the international community

  
Now whether they do it or not
this is with them

  
I can't predict but I hope so

  
BG You have mentioned before
the several European and Western leaders

  
that have gone to Moscow
in the weeks before the invasion

  
Varun in the chat asks

  
"Is the Ukraine war
a failure of diplomacy"

  
Could have 

  
Something different happened

  
YNH Oh you can understand it
in two questions

  
Did diplomacy fail to stop the war

  
Absolutely everybody knows that

  
But is it a failure in the sense
that a different diplomatic approach

  
some kind of other proposition
would have stopped the war

  
I don't know but it doesn't seem like it

  
I mean looking at the events
of the last few weeks

  
it doesn't seem that Putin
was really interested

  
in a diplomatic solution

  
It seemed that he was really
interested in the war

  
and I think again
it goes back to this basic fantasy

  
that if he really was concerned
about the security situation of Russia

  
then there was no need
to immediately invade Ukraine

  
There was no immediate threat to Russia

  
There was no discussion of right now
Ukraine joining NATO

  
There was no invasion army assembling
in the Baltic states or in Poland

  
Nothing

  
Putin chose the moment
to start this crisis

  
So this is why it doesn't seem

  
that it's really
about the security concerns

  
It seems more about this very deep fantasy

  
of reestablishing the Russian Empire

  
and of denying the very existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
BG So you live in the Middle East

  
Someone else in the chat asks

  
"What makes the situation so unique

  
compared to many other wars
that are going on right now in the world"

  
I would say aside from the nuclear
threat from Russia but what else

  
YNH Several things

  
First of all

  
we have here again something
we haven't seen since 

  
which is a dominant power

  
trying to basically
obliterate from the map

  
an independent country

  
You know when the US invaded Afghanistan

  
or when the US invaded Iraq

  
you can say a lot of things about it

  
and criticize it in many ways

  
There was no question
of the US annexing Iraq

  
or turning Iraq into the st state
of the United States

  
This is what is happening in Ukraine

  
under this pretext or this disguise

  
this is what's at stake

  
The real aim is to annex Ukraine

  
If this succeeds

  
again it brings us back
to the era of war

  
I was struck by what
the Kenyan representative

  
to the UN Security Council said
when this erupted

  
The Kenyan representative spoke
in the name of Kenya

  
and other African countries

  
And he told the Russians

  
Look we also are the product
of a postimperial order

  
The same way the Soviet empire collapsed
into different independent nations

  
also African nations came out
of the collapse of European empires

  
And the basic principle
of African politics ever since then

  
was that no matter what your objections

  
to the borders you have inherited

  
keep the borders

  
The borders are sacred

  
because if we start invading
neighboring countries because

  
"Hey this is part of our countries

  
these people are part of our nation"

  
there will not be an end to it

  
And if this now happens in Ukraine

  
it will be a blueprint for copycats
all over the world

  
The other thing which is different
is that we are talking about superpowers

  
This is not a war
between Israel and Hezbollah

  
This is potentially a war
between Russia and NATO

  
And even leaving aside nuclear weapons

  
this completely destabilizes
the peace of the entire world

  
And again I go back again
and again to the budgets

  
That if Germany doubles
its defense budget

  
if Poland doubles its defense budget

  
this will spread to every
country in the world

  
and this is terrible news

  
BG So Yuval I'm jumping
from topic to topic

  
because I want to use the last few minutes

  
to ask a few questions from the audience

  
A few people are asking
about the link to the climate crisis

  
particularly when it relates
to the energy flows

  
Like Europe is very dependent

  
part of Europe is very dependent
on Russian oil and gas

  
which is as far as we know
still flowing until today

  
But could this crisis
in a sort of paradoxical way

  
a bit like the pandemic
accelerate climate action

  
accelerate renewables and and so on

  
YNH This is the hope

  
That Europe now realizes the danger

  
and starts a green Manhattan Project

  
that kind of accelerates
what already has been happening

  
but accelerates it

  
the development of better energy sources

  
better energy infrastructure

  
which would release it
from its dependence on oil and gas

  
And it will actually undercut
the dependence of the whole world

  
on oil and gas

  
And this would be the best way
to undermine the Putin regime

  
and the Putin war machine

  
because this is what Russia has

  
oil and gas

  
That's it

  
When was the last time you bought
anything made in Russia

  
They have oil and gas

  
and we know you know the curse of oil

  
That oil is a source of riches

  
but it’s also very often
a support for dictatorships

  
Because to enjoy the benefits of oil

  
you don't need to share it
with your citizens

  
You don't need an open society

  
you don't need education
you just need to drill

  
So we see in many places

  
that oil and gas are actually
the basis for dictatorships

  
If oil and gas if the price drops

  
if they become irrelevant

  
it will not only undercut the finance

  
the power of the Russian military machine

  
it will also force Russia

  
force Putin or the Russians
to change their regime

  
BG OK let me bring up a character

  
that everybody here in the chat
seems to find quite heroic

  
and that's the Ukrainian president

  
So Ukraine kind of finds itself

  
with a comedian who turned
almost accidental president

  
who turned now war president

  
But he has shown an impressive conduct
in the last few weeks

  
especially in the last few days

  
which can be summarized
in that response he gave to the US

  
when they offered
to kind of exfiltrate him

  
so he could lead a government in exile

  
he said "I need ammunition
I don't need a ride"

  
How would you look at President Zelenskyy

  
YNH His conduct
has indeed been admirable

  
and he gives courage and inspiration
not just to the Ukrainian people

  
but I think to everybody around the world

  
I think to a large extent

  
the swift and united reaction of Europe

  
with the sanctions
and sending arms and so forth

  
to a large extent this is also
to the credit of Zelenskyy

  
That you know

  
when politicians are also human beings

  
And his direct appeal to them

  
and you know they met him
many times in person

  
and to see where he is now

  
and the threat that not only him
but his family is also in

  
And you know they talk with him

  
and he says and they know
that this may be the last time they speak

  
He may be dead murdered or bombed
in an hour or in a day

  
It really changes something

  
So in this sense I think he made
a huge personal contribution

  
to not just the reaction in Ukraine
but around the world

  
BG So Sam who’s listening
asked this question

  
"Can you provide some historical context

  
for the force and the meaning
of economic and trade sanctions

  
at the level where they are
currently imposed

  
How have previous wouldbe empires
wouldbe aggressors or aggressors

  
been constrained by such
isolations and such sanctions"

  
YNH You know what we need
again to realize about Putin's Russia

  
is that it's not the Soviet Union

  
It's a much smaller and weaker country

  
It's not like in the s

  
that in addition to the Soviet Union

  
you had the entire Soviet bloc around it

  
So it's easier in this sense
to isolate it

  
It's much more vulnerable

  
Again does it mean that sanctions
would work like a miracle

  
and stop the tanks No

  
It takes time

  
But I think that the West is in a position

  
to impact Russia

  
with these kinds of sanctions
and isolation much more

  
than let's say with the Soviet Union

  
And also the Russian people are different

  
The Russian people
don't really want this war

  
even the people in the immediate
circle around Putin

  
You know again

  
I don't know them personally
from what it seems

  
it's that these people they like life

  
They have their yachts
and they have their private airplanes

  
and they have their house in London

  
and they have their chateau in France

  
And they like the good life

  
and they want to keep enjoying it

  
So I think that the sanctions
can be really effective

  
What's the timetable

  
That's ultimately in the hands of Putin

  
BG So Gabriella asks “I remember
the war in former Yugoslavia

  
and the atrocities there

  
Is there any possibility that this war
would escalate into such a situation"

  
I think an extension to that is

  
Is this war kind of stirring
dormant conflicts

  
like in the Balkans for example

  
or in the former Central Asian republic

  
YNH Unfortunately it can get
to that level and even worse

  
If you want an analogy go to Syria

  
You look at what happened in Homs

  
At what happened in Aleppo

  
And this was done by Putin
and his airplanes

  
and his minions in Syria

  
It's the same person behind it

  
And to think that "No no no
this happened in the Middle East

  
It can't happen in Europe"

  
No

  
We could see Kyiv
in the same situation as Homs

  
as the same situation as Aleppo

  
which would be catastrophic

  
and again would plant
terrible seeds of hatred

  
for years and decades

  
So far we've seen
hundreds of people being killed

  
Ukrainian citizens being killed

  
It could reach tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands

  
So in this sense it's extremely
painful to contemplate

  
And this is why we need again and again

  
to urge the leaders to stop this war

  
and especially again and again

  
tell Putin

  
"You will not be able
to absorb Ukraine into Russia

  
They don't want it they don't want you

  
If you continue

  
the only thing you will achieve
is to create terrible hatred

  
between Ukrainians and Russians
for generations

  
It doesn't have to be like that"

  
BG Yuval let me finish
with one question about your county

  
You are in Israel

  
Israel has close ties
with both Russia and Ukraine

  
It's actually home of many Russianborn
and many Ukrainianborn Jews

  
How is the country reacting
to this conflict

  
I'm talking about the government
but also about the population

  
YNH Actually I'm not
the best person to ask

  
I've been so kind of following
what's happening around the world

  
I didn't pay so much attention
to what is happening right here

  
And even though I live here

  
I'm not an expert on Israeli society
or Israeli politics

  
Definitely the sentiment in the street
in the social media is with Ukraine

  
You see Ukrainian flags

  
you see on social media
people putting Ukrainian flags

  
on their accounts

  
And another thing
so many people in Israel

  
they came from the former Soviet Union

  
And until now

  
everybody was simply known as Russians

  
You know even if you came from Azerbaijan
or you came from Bukhara

  
you were a Russian

  
And suddenly "No no no no no

  
I'm not Russian

  
I'm Ukrainian"

  
And again these seeds of hatred
that Putin is planting

  
it's reaching also here

  
That suddenly people are saying
no Russian Ukrainian

  
until a very short time ago
it's the same thing

  
No it's not the same thing

  
So the shock waves are spreading

  
BG Yuval thank you for taking the time
and being with us today

  
and sharing your knowledge
and your views on the situation

  
Thank you very much

  
YNH Thank you
and I hope for peace quickly

  
BG We all do Thank you

Bruno Giussani It's difficult
to think clearly

  
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
because wars while they unfold

  
they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog

  
Information is abundant

  
the millions of refugees

  
the shocking suffering
and the destruction the politics

  
But sense is lacking

  
And that's going to be the focus
of this Membership conversation

  
as we enter the third week of the war

  
We won’t talk about the events of the day

  
but try to project a longer arc
a broader context

  
Our guest is geopolitical
analyst Ian Bremmer

  
He's the founder
and president of Eurasia Group

  
and we asked him to lay the scene

  
by talking first
about the geopolitical shifts

  
that have already been brought
by the war in Ukraine

  
And after we're going to have
a conversation

  
including questions from TED Members
who are participating in this call

  
Ian welcome

  
Ian Bremmer Thank you very much

  
I'll start by saying that in my lifetime

  
the most important geopolitical artifact
is the fall of the Berlin Wall

  
I mean you see it

  
if you go into the new
NATO headquarters in Brussels

  
just built a few years ago

  
And anyone that has a piece
something they're very proud of

  
they know it affected their entire lives

  
I think that in  years' time

  
and I fear that in  years' time

  
if we look back

  
a second most important
geopolitical artifact

  
will be a piece of the rubble
of the Maidan in Kyiv

  
I believe that the war
that we are seeing right now

  
is no more and no less

  
than the end of the peace dividend

  
that we all thought we had

  
when the wall came down in 

  
The idea that the world could focus
more on globalization

  
and goods and services
and people and ideas

  
going faster and faster across borders

  
leading to unprecedented growth
in human development

  
and a global middle class

  
I think that this is a tipping point

  
Won't end globalization

  
but it does end the peace dividend

  
It does mean that the Europeans overnight

  
will and must prioritize
spending on defense policy

  
on national security
coordination on NATO

  
And the speech that was given
by Olaf Scholz

  
the new chancellor two weeks ago

  
in my view the most significant speech
given by a European leader

  
in the postCold War environment

  
precisely because it's now
the postpostCold War environment

  
sending weapons to the Ukrainians

  
committing to over two percent
of GDP spend on defense

  
investing in a new fund
for defense infrastructure

  
But also recognizing that the way

  
that the Germans
and the Europeans as a whole

  
looked at the world
and looked at themselves was

  
unfortunately for all of us outdated

  
A few other points I'd like to raise
just to kick off this conversation

  
One

  
One of the reasons
I'm pretty negative about this

  
and I'm not usually very negative
I'm usually an existential optimist

  
I’m someone that’s just happy
there’s water in the glass

  
But when I look at this conflict
I’m much more concerned

  
And that is because I do not
see a scenario

  
a plausible scenario
in the foreseeable future

  
where Putin emerges from this war

  
in anything less than a radically
weakened position

  
compared to where he was
before he announced the invasion

  
And I believe that both in terms
of his domestic political orientation

  
how stable he is in his own country

  
also of course
Russia's economic position

  
and finally Russia's position
in terms of global security

  
and European security

  
ostensibly the very reason that Putin
began the war to begin with

  
Second big point is that the decoupling
that we are seeing from Europe

  
and the United States with Russia
is in my view permanent

  
And that would be true even if there were
a negotiated settlement

  
and all the Russian troops
were to pull out of Ukraine

  
and we had peace

  
I still think that a lot
of those companies would not come back

  
with Putin in power

  
I'm convinced that the decisions
by the Europeans

  
to ramp up their national security
capabilities will be permanent

  
Permanent deployments coming
in the Baltic states for example

  
forward deployments in Poland
and Bulgaria and Romania

  
And also an unwind of Europe’s
massive energy dependence

  
coal oil and most importantly gas

  
on Russia

  
That does not make Russia a global pariah

  
because you can't be a global pariah

  
if the soontobe most important
economy in the world China

  
is actually your bestie
on the global stage

  
and that indeed continues to be true

  
despite China's efforts
to portray themselves

  
towards Europe at least

  
as more neutral

  
We are going to see the Russians
as a supplicant economically

  
in terms of energy flows

  
financially in terms of transactions

  
and technologically
perhaps most important

  
aligned with China

  
That has big geopolitical
implications longterm

  
Also a lot of other developing
economies like the Indians

  
like the Gulf states like Brazil

  
are also not going to work
with Russia as a pariah

  
They'll continue to engage

  
Are there any silver linings

  
And I think there are a few

  
Of course there is a much greater
renewed purpose and mission of NATO

  
I mean this is an organization
that just a couple of years ago

  
France President Emmanuel Macron
referred to as “braindead”

  
It was increasingly drifting
in terms of its importance

  
The Americans were focusing
much more on Asia the pivot

  
Not today

  
Today NATO is purposeful

  
it's aligned it's consolidated

  
it's going to get more
resources not less

  
That's also true of the European
Union as a whole

  
even when we talk about countries
like Hungary and Poland

  
that have been much less aligned
in terms of rule of law

  
in terms of an independent judiciary

  
much more aligned in terms
of the importance

  
of common values of Europe

  
compared to that of what
we're seeing in Moscow

  
I mentioned the German security
and policy shift

  
The UKEU relationship is much
smoother and more functional

  
than at any point since Brexit
process actually started

  
And even the United States

  
I mean if you watched
the State of the Union

  
for a brief moment in time
five or  minutes

  
when all of the Democrats and Republicans
were standing and applauding together

  
you could be forgiven for believing
that the United States

  
had a functional representative democracy

  
Now I'm not sure how long
this is going to last

  
but at least as of now

  
leaders of the Democratic
and Republican Party

  
see Putin as much more
of a threat an enemy

  
than they do their opponents
across the aisle in domestic politics

  
And two weeks ago that was not true

  
That's significant

  
Final silver lining
and I wish it was more of one

  
but the Chinese

  
as much as they are strategically
aligned with Russia

  
and with the person of President Putin

  
they do not want a second Cold War

  
And they would rather
a negotiated settlement

  
They're not willing to push
very hard for it

  
But they certainly do not see
a radical decoupling of the Russian

  
and potentially the Chinese economy

  
from the rest of the world from Europe

  
from the US from the advanced
industrial democracies

  
as in any way in their interest

  
And ultimately that does create
at least some buffer

  
some guardrail on how much this is likely
to escalate as a conflict going forward

  
BG I want to make a step back
and unpack some of that

  
maybe starting with a question
that relates to your last point

  
and is probably on the mind of many

  
And it is

  
Is there still some real
space for negotiation

  
Is there still a potential relationship
between Russia and Ukraine

  
IB The foreign ministers of Russia
and Ukraine just met recently in Turkey

  
It was as much of a nonevent

  
as the three preceding negotiations
of more junior representatives

  
of their teams on the Belarus border

  
The one thing that has been
accomplished to a small degree

  
has been humanitarian corridors

  
extending out of a number
of Ukrainian cities

  
that are being pounded
by Russian military

  
That's because the Ukrainians are
interested in protecting their civilians

  
and the Russians are interested
in taking a lot of territory

  
without necessarily having to kill
so many Ukrainians

  
that could cause problems
for them internationally

  
as well as domestically inside Russia

  
But that is nowhere close
to a negotiated settlement

  
Now I mean everyone I know

  
that's involved
in the negotiations right now

  
responds that the President Putin himself
is hellbent on taking Kyiv

  
and on removing Zelenskyy from power

  
Now I think and by the way
they're getting quite close

  
to being able to accomplish that
militarily on the ground

  
I think within the next couple of weeks
certainly it looks very likely

  
A couple of points here

  
One there is no reason to put
any stock in anything

  
that the Russians are saying publicly
in terms of their diplomacy

  
They lied to the face
of every world leader

  
about the invasion that they said
they were not going to do into Ukraine

  
And then just today

  
Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov publicly said

  
well the Russians didn't attack Ukraine

  
I mean this is Orwellian stuff right

  
So first of all do not report
on Russian public statements

  
as if they bear any semblance
to reality on the ground

  
Secondarily this looks like a huge
loss for Putin right now

  
He understands it and I think
he would have a hard time

  
even with his control of information
spinning this to his public

  
without removing Zelenskyy

  
without the “deNazification”
as he calls it 

  
which is an obscenity in an environment

  
where the Ukrainian president
is actually Jewish 

  
the disarmament of Ukraine

  
and of course the ability of the Russians

  
to change how they feel about Ukraine
as a threat to the Russian homeland

  
BG What level of support
can we give Ukraine militarily

  
intel economic

  
before Putin considers
taking a strike on a NATO country

  
IB Well it’s interesting the way
you framed that Bruno

  
Because I mean

  
I think that Putin is already considering
strikes on NATO countries

  
I mean there were massive attacks

  
cyberattacks and disinformation attacks

  
by Russia against NATO countries
with reckless abandon

  
over the course of the past years

  
And in fact when President Biden
met with Putin in Geneva back in June

  
it seems like years
and years ago at this point

  
Biden set the agenda

  
Ukraine was largely not discussed

  
but what was discussed was cyberattacks
on critical infrastructure

  
Because you may remember Bruno

  
that meeting came right after
the cyber attacks

  
against the Colonial Pipeline

  
And the Russians after that
indeed pulled back

  
on supporting those attacks
by their criminal cyber syndicates

  
I expect those attacks to restart
in very short order

  
against NATO countries

  
I also believe that the fact that the West
is sending weapons to Ukraine

  
and is providing realtime
intelligence reports

  
on the disposition of Russian troops
on the ground in Ukraine

  
to better allow the Ukrainians
to defend themselves

  
and blow the Russians up

  
that is considered by the Russians
to be an act of war

  
and they will retaliate

  
And how they retaliate is the question

  
I don't think they're going to send
troops into Poland

  
But you know

  
when the Americans under Reagan
were providing that kind of support

  
to the mujahideen

  
to help them defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan

  
the Soviets saw that as an act of war

  
and they engaged in acts of terrorism
against the mujahideen in Pakistan

  
And I absolutely think
that that is on the table

  
in terms of front line
NATO countries especially

  
like Poland like the Baltic states
like Bulgaria Romania

  
Would that be considered
an Article V attack

  
Would that force NATO countries
to strike the Russians back

  
I'm not sure it would

  
Not directly not militarily

  
So I mean I do think that the fact
that the NATO countries see

  
there is some sort of a big red line
between sending troops in for example

  
and doing a nofly zone
because that could cause World War III

  
but everything short of that
is just a proxy war

  
The Russians don't see it that way

  
And that gives the Russians
some advantage tactically

  
in terms of their willingness to escalate

  
BG You're describing a spiral
of escalation here

  
that will touch the globe
and not only Ukraine

  
not only the eastern flank of Europe

  
which means that not only this war
has ripple effects everywhere

  
but this is also starting
a sort of realignment

  
of the global geopolitical
situation and context

  
To me it has been very striking
how Europe and the US

  
have kind of moved very fast
in a cohesive way

  
And it has chosen after years
of prioritizing the economics

  
in their international
and global dealings

  
it's chosen to put politics over markets

  
It has adopted sanctions
that will hurt Russia

  
but will also hurt Western businesses

  
It’s the discussion about decoupling
that you put forward before

  
an active kind of fencing out
of the Russian economy

  
Talk to us about how do you see
this decoupling playing out

  
IB Yeah I mean I do think
that for the Europeans

  
this is a permanent move

  
I mean I've spoken to top leaders
in the German government

  
who tell me that Nord Stream
was a strategic mistake

  
and they understand it

  
Who say that you know

  
Scholz making this speech
from the Social Democratic Party

  
on the center left

  
is the equivalent of Nixon going to China

  
No one else could have made that move

  
But having made it everyone is on board

  
The popularity in Germany

  
even given the massive
economic consequences

  
is extraordinary and is across the board

  
And what they need to do now

  
is ensure that the diversification
of fossil fuels in the near term

  
away from Russia

  
towards Qatar and Azerbaijan
and even you know

  
sort of the United States for LNG

  
can be done as fast as humanly possible

  
And that further even though
it’s going to cost a lot

  
some of it will be uneconomic

  
the move towards renewables
actually picks up and is faster

  
The Italians Mario Draghi

  
I think his shift in strategic
orientation that they will do

  
this is his "whatever it takes" moment

  
He had that in response
to the  financial crisis

  
as the head of the European Central Bank

  
and that made him “Super Mario”

  
This is making him Super Mario
as the Italian prime minister

  
This is the "whatever it takes"
moment for the Italians

  
who never make public statements
that undermine their economic

  
their commercial interests
like this in such a strategic way

  
The French of course
have less to be concerned about

  
in the sense that most of their energy
comes from nuclear power and is domestic

  
So they are not as affected directly
by a cutoff from Russia

  
And also because Macron fancies himself

  
especially as the leader
of the European Commission this year

  
the rotating leadership
occupying the presidency

  
but also with his elections coming up

  
and just given his personal belief
that he can drive diplomacy

  
I believe that even after Kyiv falls

  
and after Zelenskyy
is either killed or forced out

  
that the Americans will not want
to engage in direct diplomacy

  
the Germans probably won't

  
The French will

  
And by the way the Chinese will too

  
And I do believe
that there is a potential

  
and this is a danger
for the cohesiveness of the West

  
that the Chinese and Macron end up being
the postKyiv Normandy format

  
of diplomacy

  
That's something that the Americans
and the Germans right now

  
are starting to worry about quite a bit

  
Now that's the European shift

  
And I think as I said
I think it's permanent

  
I believe the UK is in that camp as well

  
I'm not so sure the United States
is going to be as committed

  
for as long a term

  
It doesn't affect the Americans
as much economically

  
it doesn't affect the Americans as much
in terms of a direct security issue

  
None of those refugees are coming
to the United States

  
But also American inequality

  
American political polarization
and dysfunction is so much greater

  
than what you experience
on the continent in Europe

  
So the potential that in six months' time
or in two years' time

  
as we're thinking about the  election

  
that the Americans have largely forgotten
about this Russia issue instead

  
are focusing once again
on domestic political opponents

  
as principal adversaries

  
which deeply undermines NATO

  
much more than anything
that would come from the Europeans

  
I think that is a real
open question going forward

  
that is perhaps as significant
as the question of where the Chinese go

  
BG Let me pick up on the point
you made about energy

  
because somehow Putin's calculus
can really change

  
if Russian oil and gas
stops flowing to Europe

  
if it becomes part
of the sanctions right

  
And this war indeed can kind of be read

  
as a war about energy

  
Selling energy funds it for Russia

  
being dependent on Russian energy makes
the European response more constrained

  
Rising energy insecurity
rising energy cost

  
may or probably will destabilize
European politics and economy

  
in the coming months

  
How would you look at this
from the perspective of energy

  
and is there any likelihood

  
that Russian oil and gas
is going to stop flowing

  
either because Putin cuts it
or the Europeans sanction it

  
IB Yeah or because it's blown up
in some of the transit in Ukraine

  
I mean keep in mind

  
so much of the gas transit
is going through large pipeline networks

  
which have some redundancy
across all of Ukraine

  
But there's a big war
that's going on right there

  
and lots of people that could have
incentive to create problems

  
The Americans of course the Canadians

  
have said that they're cutting off
oil import from Russia

  
but those are nominal numbers

  
so they don't matter very
much to the markets

  
The Europeans as I said

  
want to decouple themselves
as quickly as possible

  
but they believe that doing that this year
would be economic suicide

  
So there isn't despite everything
we see from Russia

  
they're using thermobaric weapons now
against the Ukrainian people

  
the Americans are warning

  
that they could use chemical
biological weapons against Ukraine

  
I mean you know
you even have some people saying

  
what if they use
a tactical nuclear weapon

  
I mean 

  
God willing none of these
things come to pass

  
But it is very hard to see
a military scenario in Ukraine

  
that leads the Europeans

  
to completely cut off their inbound gas
from Russia this year

  
It's very hard to see

  
And also I would say it's very hard
to see any level of economic sanction

  
that would change the mind of the Russians

  
in terms of their military decision making

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now I think there are a lot of things
that the West is doing

  
in terms of providing weapons
for the Ukrainians

  
that are having an impact on the ground

  
A lot more Russians are getting killed

  
It won’t prevent them
from taking to Kyiv again in my mind

  
I feel quite confident about that

  
But it's quite possible
perhaps even likely

  
that the west of Ukraine
will remain in Ukrainian hands

  
which means that you know
after this fighting is "over"

  
that a rump Ukrainian state in exile
exists in the West run by Zelenskyy

  
or someone that's aligned with him

  
and that they continue to get
enormous economic and military support

  
from all of the NATO countries

  
So even though I don't think

  
that the energy situation
will become so parlous

  
that it would affect
Putin's decision making

  
I do think that the West's response
does matter on the ground

  
BG The war is kind of having radiating
economic shock waves around the world now

  
ripple effects on food markets
for example and food security

  
We talk a lot about energy security

  
what about food security

  
IB Well you have the largest
grain producer in the world

  
invading the fifth largest
grain producer in the world

  
on the back of a twoyear pandemic
that's still ongoing

  
We don't talk about it much anymore
but it's still there

  
And of course this hit the poorest
countries in the world the hardest

  
The level of indebtedness

  
and the unsustainability
of paying that debt off

  
was already becoming a massive problem

  
for so many of the developing
countries in the world

  
And the IMF provided a lot of relief
in special drawing rights and direct aid

  
over the course of the past  months

  
but that money is now running to an end

  
And what happens
when commodity prices spike up

  
and we have severe supply chain challenges
with energy and food

  
and those things
are obviously very related

  
What happens is that a lot of people die

  
What happens is we see
a lot more starvation

  
The World Food Organization says about 
million people a year die of starvation

  
That number in the next  months
is going to be a lot higher

  
than it otherwise would have been

  
The number of people
who are food stressed in the world

  
is going to go way up
in subSaharan Africa in Yemen

  
in Afghanistan in Bangladesh

  
It's going to go way up

  
And you know
it's horrible to think about

  
but the massive impact
of this Russia crisis

  
is going to be much more
global inequality

  
And this is of course

  
a direct consequence of the end
of the peace dividend more structurally

  
That over the last  years
of globalization

  
what did you have

  
A lot of people were left behind

  
but the biggest thing you had

  
was the explosion of a single
global middle class

  
On the back of the pandemic

  
and now this RussiaUkraine war

  
and the decoupling of the Russian
economy from the West

  
which doesn't matter so much in terms
of the size of the Russian economy

  
but it matters immensely in terms
of commodities globally and supply chain

  
those two things are going
to seriously unwind

  
the growth of this global middle class

  
and they're going to stress developing
countries to a much greater degree

  
They will lead to financial crises
in countries like Turkey for example

  
that will no longer be able
to service their debt

  
You'll see more Lebanons out there

  
You'll see some in Latin America
you'll see some in subSaharan Africa

  
Those are the knockon effects and so

  
so many people that have been saying
over the last few weeks

  
"Why are we paying so much
attention to Ukraine

  
It's because they're white people
because they're European

  
We wouldn't pay that much attention
if they were Afghans

  
or if they were you know Afghanis
or if they were Yemenis

  
We wouldn't"

  
I mean first of all you've got millions
and millions of Ukrainian refugees

  
and we're not paying
as much attention to them

  
as we did to the Syrian refugees
precisely because of race

  
precisely because the Europeans
are more willing to integrate

  
millions and millions
of "fellow Europeans" into Europe

  
But we are paying much more attention
to the Ukraine crisis and we should

  
because the impact on the poorest
people around the world

  
is vastly greater

  
from this conflict
than anything that we've seen

  
in any of those smaller economies
with less impact

  
despite all of the human depredation
that’s happened over the past  years

  
BG Ian I want to talk
for a second about climate

  
because another crisis that has kind of
disappeared from the headlines

  
is the climate crisis right

  
Ten days ago the IPCC released a report

  
that the secretary general
of the UN described

  
as an "atlas of human suffering"

  
if I remember correctly

  
And it has been basically ignored

  
Over the last several years

  
much of the world had started to embark
with more or less enthusiasm

  
on a process of transitioning
away from oil and gas

  
and into kind of a clean energy future

  
And now the war comes in

  
and we look at what you just described
the unraveling of global supply chains

  
the dependency on energy and so on

  
And there are kind of two
schools of thought here

  
One says this war is going to accelerate
the adoption of clean energy

  
because we need to diminish dependence
from Russia and these fossil fuels

  
And the other says
the other school of thought says

  
it's going to derail
the transition to clean energy

  
because suddenly the priority
is no longer decarbonization

  
suddenly the priority
is energy security energy supply

  
IB The Europeans
are largely in the first camp

  
and they will move towards faster
decoupling and investment accordingly

  
The Americans are largely
in the second camp

  
and they will move towards

  
"Let's focus more on fossil fuels
and partisan divide on this issue"

  
accordingly

  
The Chinese

  
who are the largest carbon emitter
in the world by a long margin

  
though not per capita
and not historically

  
but still in terms of every year totals

  
they will continue on the same
path they've been on

  
which is a netzero target

  
but without yet a very strong plan
on how to get there

  
and not feeling a lot of pressure
to provide that plan

  
because they think the Americans
are completely incoherent

  
and incapable of effectuating
a strategic longterm plan

  
on climate themselves

  
So I mean what we have is a lot
of progress on climate and of course

  
technology around renewable energies
and around electric batteries

  
and supply chain

  
continue to get cheaper and cheaper

  
as more money is being invested in it

  
And that does make me longterm
more optimistic that by 

  
a majority of the world's energy
will probably be coming from renewables

  
And five years ago
I wouldn't have said that

  
But still I mean when the news today

  
is that the Americans are sending
a highlevel delegation to Caracas

  
to figure out if we can reopen
relations with Venezuela

  
to get them to produce more oil again

  
With the Iranians

  
let's do any deal possible to get back
into the JCPOA the nuclear deal

  
so that we can get that oil on the market

  
Calling the Saudis calling the Emiratis

  
and they’re not willing to take
Biden’s phone call on this issue

  
while they're talking to Putin

  
Those are warning signals
that in the near term

  
we've got some big challenges

  
and a lot of those challenges are going
to be filled with fossil fuels

  
and fossil fuel development

  
And so I do think that the fact

  
that both of the answers to your question
are true in different places

  
on netnet is more negative
for how quickly we can transition

  
BG Let's talk a bit about China

  
Brigid I think
who’s listening in asks

  
"What do you believe
Xi Jinping is learning

  
from the world's response
to the crisis to the Ukrainian war"

  
IB Well certainly learning that this
was a red line for the West

  
And I think that this
would have surprised

  
it obviously surprised Putin

  
I think it would have surprised
Xi Jinping as well

  
Xi Jinping saw Afghanistan

  
He saw that Merkel was out

  
He saw that Macron is focused
on strategic autonomy

  
He sees Biden as much more focused
on China and Asia

  
I think that this
is a surprise to Xi Jinping

  
But Xi Jinping also sees

  
that a lot of the world
is not with NATO on this issue

  
 countries if I remember correctly

  
voted to censor the Russians
for their invasion of Ukraine

  
at the United Nations General Assembly

  
But very large numbers of that 

  
are not on board with all
of these sanctions against Russia

  
They're happy with the diplomatic censure

  
but they need to continue
to work with the Russians

  
The Chinese see that too

  
The Chinese see just how much more
fragmented the global order is

  
I thought the most significant thing
that we've seen from the Chinese so far

  
two issues

  
The first is of course
when Putin went to Beijing

  
and Xi Jinping made
the public announcement

  
that “this is our best friend
on the global stage

  
and we will work much more strategically
with them economically

  
diplomatically and militarily
going forward"

  
And Xi Jinping knew very well
where Ukraine was heading at that point

  
and also knew that the likelihood
of an invasion was coming

  
Didn't stop him from making
that announcement in the slightest

  
And then after the invasion
and it's going badly

  
I mean if you watch Chinese social media

  
the fact is that the censorship
is all about Ukraine

  
I mean the Chinese media space

  
is pursuing a relentlessly
proPutin policy

  
They have media embedded
with Russian troops

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now publicly the Chinese
government wants to be seen

  
as “We’re neutral we like the Russians

  
we like the Ukrainians

  
we still want to work with everybody"

  
But the fact is that China
feels no problem

  
being publicly completely
aligned with Putin

  
despite the fact that they are invading
a democratic government

  
with  million people
in the middle of Europe

  
That's a pretty astonishing
statement from the Chinese

  
And there's no question
that they have learned

  
that they're in a vastly better
economic position than they used to be

  
and that gives them influence

  
They are a government
who projects its power

  
primarily through economic
and technological means

  
as opposed to Russia that projects it
primarily through military means

  
And the Chinese believe

  
that there is a level of decoupling
that is already going on

  
as the Americans focus
on more industrial policy

  
as they focus on America first
for American workers

  
A US foreign policy for the American
middle class as Biden put it

  
is one that really pushes a lot of capital
to leave a country like China

  
which had served
as the factory for the world

  
but at the expense of a lot of labor

  
coming out of advanced
industrial economies

  
And now yes there are
definitely some dangers

  
that come from the Chinese being perceived
as too close to Russia

  
and they won't want that

  
and they'll want to make sure
that they're engaging diplomatically

  
with the Europeans
to try to minimize that damage

  
But I thought it was very interesting

  
and I'm not sure this is public yet

  
that the Chinese ambassador to Russia
recently in the last few days

  
organized a meeting of a lot
of the top investors

  
Chinese investors in Russia saying

  
"This is a unique opportunity
the West is leaving

  
we should be going in and doing more

  
Because they're going to be completely
reliant on us going forward"

  
That is not a message
that the Chinese ambassador delivers

  
unless he is told
directly to from Beijing

  
BG Ian I'm going to jump
from topic to topic

  
because there are several
questions in the chat

  
Nancy is asking about whether Putin
can be removed from power

  
There's been a lot of discussion lately
about regime change in Russia

  
either endogenous like a palace coup

  
or provoked by sanctions
and other policies

  
And so she asks

  
"How likely is that Putin will face
a challenge from inside Russia

  
whether a popular uprising
a coup or other"

  
IB It's very very unlikely
until it happens

  
(Chuckles)

  
I mean in the sense
that there is absolutely no purpose

  
in trying to say oh I mean you know

  
there are rumors that Defense Minister
Shoigu is unhappy and you know

  
he might be making a move

  
And I’ve seen these
from relatively credible analysts

  
I'm like no no
if there are such rumors

  
then we know it's not happening

  
because that's the end
of Shoigu and his family

  
But it's very clear that there is more
pressure on Putin now

  
than at any point
since he's been president

  
Domestic pressure on Putin

  
About  Russians
have been arrested so far detained

  
most of them have been released

  
for nonviolent antiwar protests

  
The Russians have shut down
all the Western media

  
They've shut down all the Russian
opposition and independent media

  
So Putin has control of the space

  
though if you look at Russian
conversations on Telegram

  
you'll still see a bunch of people
that are seriously seriously antiwar

  
But you know once the economy
starts truly imploding

  
and you can't find goods on shelves
in Russia in major cities

  
and this is coming you know very soon
this is a matter of days

  
in many of these cities

  
those demonstrations
will likely become greater

  
some of them can become violent

  
You know that'll increase the pressure

  
Then you have the issue of how
the Russians are fighting on the ground

  
I mean what happens
if you get a lot of desertions

  
We haven't seen that so far

  
What happens if you get
orders to bomb Kyiv

  
and a whole bunch of Russian
fighter pilots bomber pilots

  
decide not to and they defect
to Poland to Germany

  
That would have a big impact on morale

  
That has not happened so far

  
I mean do be aware of the fact

  
that the Ukrainians are winning
the war on information

  
and that means that the information
that you are getting in the West

  
about the war

  
is much more proUkrainian 

  
morale enthusiasm

  
how well the military is doing 

  
than what's actually
happening on the ground

  
And also be aware of the fact

  
that the Russians completely control
the war on information inside Russia

  
BG Exactly

  
IB They're not getting a balanced view

  
They're getting a completely
proPutin view

  
And most of them actually believe it

  
in the same way that most people
that voted for Trump in the US

  
believe that the election was stolen
and Trump is still president

  
I mean it's much worse
in Russia in that regard

  
than it is in the United States

  
and I think that that's
underappreciated in the West

  
So even though I think there's pressure

  
I really don't think
that it's super likely

  
that Putin is out anytime imminently

  
BG Ed is asking whether you see
any offramp for Putin

  
IB I think that the most likely offramp
for Putin is after Kyiv is taken

  
and Zelenskyy is removed
one way or the other

  
at that point

  
the possibility of the Russians
accepting a frozen conflict

  
or a cease fire that could lead
to ongoing negotiations

  
is a lot higher

  
because Putin can sell that as a win
back home much more easily

  
But also because further
Russian attacks at that point

  
serve much less purpose for the Russians

  
are much harder to bring about

  
and potentially have much more
negative consequences

  
So for me that would be
the nearterm potential break

  
where we could at least freeze issues
largely where they are

  
Now whether that could then eventually
lead to a climbdown or not

  
I mean the Russians have been very happy
with frozen conflicts on their borders

  
for years and years and years

  
I'm thinking about NagornoKarabakh
between Armenia and Azerbaijan

  
which basically stayed in place
until the Azeris

  
over the course of a decade
got enough military capacity

  
that they could forcibly change
the situation on the ground

  
Which by the way the Ukrainians might
also be eventually thinking about

  
because the West will be supplying them
with advanced weapons all the way through

  
I'm thinking South Ossetia in Georgia

  
I'm also of course thinking
about the two pieces of Ukraine

  
they took back in 

  
So be aware of the fact that a negotiation
that creates a cease fire

  
does not mean you're anywhere
close to a resolution

  
or an end of the fighting
that we're seeing

  
BG Someone else in the chat
who didn't sign by his or her name

  
is asking about the nuclear fear
that hangs over the conflict

  
How should we think of that

  
IB Yeah we don't like it
when Putin uses the Nword

  
and there's no question

  
I mean he and his direct reports
have rattled nuclear sabers

  
on at least five times
that I've seen in the past few weeks

  
I think that 

  
In  I wasn't alive
we had the Cuban Missile Crisis

  
There was a real possibility
of nuclear confrontation

  
between the world's two superpowers

  
At least for the last  years
there’s been no chance of that

  
Functionally no chance of that

  
I think we're now back in a world

  
where a Cuban Missile Crisis
is again a reality

  
Now that doesn't mean that I think
nuclear war is likely or imminent

  
I don't

  
And in fact

  
there is active deconfliction
going on even today

  
the Americans and Russians
with a new hotline

  
the secretary general of the UN

  
with the Russian defense minister

  
engaging in deconfliction
measures with UN

  
offices being invited to Moscow

  
So as bad as it is right now

  
people that have been
doing this for a long time

  
are trying to avoid nuclear war

  
But that's the point

  
Is we're now in a situation

  
where the conflict
that we're going to experience

  
needs to be actively managed

  
because of the danger
of nuclear confrontation

  
So it now becomes a risk on the horizon
that we must be continually aware of

  
even if only at a low level

  
as we take and consider further actions

  
as we consider diplomacy

  
as we consider escalation

  
It is now on the table in a way
that frankly is so debilitating

  
I mean as human beings all on this call

  
one of the most painful
things to think about

  
is the fact that we still have
these  nuclear warheads in Russia

  
and  the United States
that are still pointed at each other

  
and they still have the potential
to destroy the planet

  
And we haven't had any real
lessons that we've been able to learn

  
institutionally from 

  
BG  being a generic figure
not the exact figure

  
but we are kind of
in that order of magnitude

  
Then of course there is the question
of civilian nuclear

  
so the two power plants
nuclear power plants

  
that have been seized by the Russians

  
One has been slightly damaged by a bomb

  
the other has been turned off

  
But those are also potentially gigantic
nuclear problems just waiting to happen

  
IB Chemical weapons biological weapons

  
I mean look we have had two million
refugees from Ukraine in two weeks

  
As this continues you're looking
at five to  million refugees

  
I mean it is hard 

  
Just take a step for a moment
just as a human being

  
Imagine what it would take for a quarter
of your country's population

  
to say “I am not living here anymore

  
I am leaving everything
because of the condition of the country

  
because of this unjust war

  
that has been imposed upon you
by your neighbor"

  
That's what we're looking at

  
And again it's important
for us to you know

  
not lose the humanity of this crisis

  
and the extraordinary hardship

  
that is being visited
upon  million Ukrainians

  
that have done nothing wrong
they have committed no sin

  
other than their desire to have
an independent country

  
BG One other country

  
that has not yet taken
a very clear position is India

  
IB Well they're a member of the Quad

  
and their relationship with China
is pretty bad and that’s mutual

  
But in terms of Russia

  
there's been a longstanding relationship

  
trade relationship defense relationship

  
between India and Russia

  
that the Russians
are not going to jettison

  
and they see no reason to jettison it

  
And as long as you've got a whole bunch
of other countries out there

  
that are substantial
that are willing to say

  
we're going to keep playing ball
with the Russians

  
then the Indians will too

  
And that's why you've got the abstention
in the United Nations vote

  
And that's why you've had
very careful comments

  
as opposed to overt
and strong condemnation

  
coming from the Indian leadership

  
BG Phil in the chat is asking

  
"Will this cause a fragmentation
of the financial system

  
with kind of a Western system
and an Eastern system”

  
So two different SWIFTlike systems
two different credit card systems

  
crypto what's the role
of crypto in all this

  
IB I hope not

  
I mean I will tell you
that before the invasion started

  
if you talk to most Western CEOs

  
and I'm talking across
the entire sweep of sectors

  
so it's finance and it's manufacturing
and its services and it's tech

  
most of them would have told you
that they did not in any way plan

  
on reducing their footprint in China

  
and a lot of them said

  
that China was their most important
growth market in the world

  
Not a surprise

  
China is going to be the largest
economy in the world in 

  
So you know a world
that you're decoupling

  
is not a good world

  
when China is going to be
number one economically

  
I mean that obviously
is going to hurt the West in a big way

  
So there are strong
incentives against that

  
and there remain very strong
and powerful entrenched interests

  
in the United States and Europe
that will resist direct decoupling

  
Despite the fact that there are
these more incremental moves

  
towards friendsourcing and insourcing

  
because you know
Chinese labor is more expensive

  
you don’t need as much labor
to get capital moving

  
given robotics

  
and big data deep learning
all of those things

  
But I do think that the Russia conflict

  
risks a level of secondorder decoupling

  
Because if the Russians end up
financially integrated with China

  
in their own

  
notaseffective SWIFT system

  
and all of their energy
ends up going to China

  
and the Chinese build that infrastructure
and they get a discount on it

  
and Russia's technology and their military
industrial complex gets serviced

  
by Chinese semiconductors
and Chinese componentry

  
well I do think that there will be
knockon decoupling

  
that will be longer term
and more strategic

  
from the United States from the Europeans

  
and even from Japan and South Korea

  
So that is a worry

  
and I think the Chinese
are highly aware of that

  
And over the coming months
they will do everything they can

  
both with the Europeans in particular

  
but also I expect at least
with some of the Asian economies

  
to try to limit the impact of that

  
Now keep in mind

  
we haven't talked at all
about Asia yet outside of China

  
The new Japanese Prime Minister Kishida
is at least as hawkish

  
in his orientation towards
China and Russia as Abe was

  
He is providing support
for the Ukrainians

  
including some military capacity 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
He's allowing Ukrainian refugees 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
And yesterday the South Koreans
had a very very tight election

  
and Yoon is now in charge

  
He is on the right and he is the guy
that is strongly antiChina

  
was talking about South Korea
having nuclear capabilities

  
wants a new THAAD missile
defense system for the South Koreans

  
and wants to rebuild
the relationship with Tokyo

  
That matters

  
And that's a big strategic change
in the geopolitical map

  
that will look more problematic
on the decoupling front

  
from Beijing's perspective

  
BG Three final quick questions
that all come from the chat Ian

  
One is because you mentioned
the rest of Asia outside of China

  
"What about the rest of the world

  
What about Africa and Latin America

  
How do they factor into this
conversation or don't they"

  
IB They factor in

  
I mean those that have
significant commodities do well

  
because the prices
are going to be so high

  
Those that don't are going to be
under massive pressure

  
for reasons we already talked about

  
but they are not going to be forced
to pick a side on this one

  
I just don't see it

  
In the same way that if you were Colombia
in the last couple of years

  
you know you found

  
even though you're working very closely
with an American ally

  
you're still dealing with Huawei and G

  
This is knockon effects of all of this

  
These are countries
that are not going to take on

  
significant economic burden

  
given how much they're suffering
right now geopolitically

  
BG Another one is about sanctions

  
How do we even know when and how

  
at what point we start
rolling back sanctions

  
IB I think that as long
as Ukraine is occupied

  
by the Russian government

  
for the foreseeable future
and Putin is there

  
I can't see these sanctions
getting unwound

  
Now if a rump Ukrainian government
that is democratically elected

  
were prepared to sue for peace
and retakes most of Ukraine

  
but they give away Crimea
and they give away the Donbass

  
could you see in that environment
some of these sanctions unwound

  
Sure

  
But I mean I am suggesting

  
that I think that many of these sanctions
are functionally permanent

  
They reflect a new way of doing business

  
And when people ask me
what’s going to happen when this is over

  
my response is what do you mean over

  
What's over is the peace dividend

  
We are now in a new environment

  
BG And one of the figures
of this new environment

  
and I want to close with that
is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine

  
who was not taken very seriously
when he was elected

  
he has come out as a significant
figure in this war

  
What do you make of President Zelenskyy

  
How do you read this character

  
IB He's very courageous

  
I'm obviously inspired by his ability
to communicate and rally his people

  
and take personal risk in Kyiv
while this invasion is going on

  
But I'm very conflicted

  
because I think many of the steps
that Zelenskyy took

  
in the runup to this conflict

  
actually made the likelihood
of conflict worse

  
He was unwilling to take the advice
of the Americans and Europeans seriously

  
in the months leading up to the conflict

  
He was unwilling to mobilize his people

  
to ready them for
the potential of conflict

  
He was certainly unwilling to give an inch

  
in terms of Ukraine's desire
to be a member of NATO

  
even though he knew completely

  
that no one in NATO was prepared
to offer a membership action plan

  
let alone actually
bring them in as members

  
And part of that is a lack of experience

  
and lack of any business
being in that position

  
in the runup to this crisis

  
So I’m very deeply conflicted
in my personal views on Zelenskyy

  
given the way he behaved
before the invasion

  
compared to the extraordinary leadership
that he has displayed to all of us

  
over the last two weeks

  
BG Ian thank you for taking the time

  
for sharing your knowledge
and your analysis with us

  
We deeply appreciate it
Thank you very much

  
IB Good to see all of you

“Turn the tides

  
We must give back”

  
chant my ancestors

  
The thunder strikes 

  
(Hands clap)

  
as the sea demoness 
swept through the lands

  
with a fiery likeness of Letao’s fire

  
Tearing apart livelihood

  
the mounting waves and erosions
leave my island gaping

  
like the mouth of a dead fish

  
Tense muscles of uncles and aunties

  
that hauled cement for the seawall

  
cooked meals for the hungry bellies

  
Release in relief

  
The tides have gone out

  
I look to my grandparents’ graves

  
intimate with limp seaweeds

  
The disrespect

  
(Marshallese) Iakwe nan aolep

  
My name is Selina Leem

  
At  at the COP 

  
alongside late ambassador
for climate change Tony de Brum

  
I introduced myself
as a small island girl with big dreams

  
Five years later I reintroduced myself

  
as a climate warrior from Aelon Kein Ad

  
the Marshall Islands

  
Situated between Hawaii and Australia

  
our chain of islands decorate
the Pacific Ocean like seashells

  
and they are home to about  people

  
Our islands average about
two meters above sea level

  
and it is not uncommon to see
both the ocean and lagoon side

  
from wherever you stand

  
We say our highest point

  
is the bridge which curves
about seven meters above the sea

  
The massive body of water
is our reality and our livelihood

  
With a history of seafaring

  
the ocean connected our islands together

  
as well as providing
many resources to fish

  
to feed

  
and to adorn our handicrafts
with seashells that we make a living from

  
But the climate crisis has brought
calamities to my people

  
threatening our very livelihoods

  
In the Pacific king tide season
is from November to April

  
This is when the tides
are at their highest

  
and each year the sea level rises

  
In these months especially houses
by the seashore end up flooded

  
or damaged completely

  
Schools and churches have had to open
their doors for community members

  
to come sleep at

  
when announcements come in the radio
advising to find shelter

  
because of incoming tides

  
And we huddled together
with our blankets and pillows

  
no matter that we are strangers
as we sleep next to one another

  
Seawalls are rebuilt
as soon as it’s low tide

  
only to be broken down again

  
by the waves that grow higher each year

  
And these waves

  
their path continues on into the islands

  
bringing with it garbage
we’ve thrown into it

  
You see the graves of your loved ones
submerged in water

  
littered

  
Then the vegetation starts to brown;

  
it is dying

  
The soil becomes salinated

  
You pray the bigger trees hold on

  
for their roots are needed
to prevent further erosion

  
In the most effected parts of the lands

  
the land has regressed

  
coming closer and closer
to the road each year

  
Our driest part of the year happens
within this time period too

  
We are unable to use groundwater well
because it becomes saltier as well

  
In the capital Majuro once per week

  
water is dispensed

  
and my neighbors and I fill up our tanks

  
our water catchments

  
our bottles and our buckets

  
Our government has had to declare
a state of national emergency

  
calling for help from our friends

  
Sealevel rising

  
flooding

  
droughts

  
erosion have been the reality
of my people for many many many years

  
We’ve been told to move

  
To become climate change refugees

  
I’m not even sure
who would even take us in

  
But to those who think
that we can just accept our fate

  
I want to say

  
Adaptation and Indigenous knowledge 
are the solutions

  
These islands are our ancestors

  
our predecessors

  
our homes

  
We are at the risk of losing all of that

  
for something we contributed
very very little to

  
Raising and expanding the islands
is something my country is thinking of

  
However we don’t have the resources
nor the infrastructure

  
Regardless

  
we remain adamant

  
We continue to fight for our livelihoods

  
and not abandon our home

  
Thank you

It’s the morning of June th 

  
and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic  kilometer journey

  
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather

  
flying an average of  kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight

  
Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the DDay invasion back to England

  
He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment

  
Paddy was one of around  pigeons

  
used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages

  
In fact pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices

  
Seeing their meat as a protein source

  
and their nitrogenrich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer

  
humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as  years ago

  
We then tapped into other traits

  
Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct

  
that drives them to navigate
long distances

  
back to the location they consider “home”

  
So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing

  
In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying”

  
people selected for traits 
like head plumage

  
and fabulously feathered feet

  
As we carried pigeons around the world
they escaped or were released

  
forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today

  
Pigeons are now one of the most abundant
widespread species on the planet

  
managing to thrive in chaotic cities

  
They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits

  
including some that were
accentuated by humans

  
Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees

  
pigeons were originally cliffdwellers

  
City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat

  
And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking

  
Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass

  
and it's a great spot to raise babies

  
This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments

  
where more specialized species can’t

  
As generalists pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste

  
With an organ in their throats 
called a crop

  
they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later

  
They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food

  
Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and proteinrich meal

  
If conditions are right
pigeons breed yearround

  
and produce new offspring every six weeks

  
They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities

  
because of the abundance 
of food and shelter

  
These booming populations 
attract predators

  
New York City is home 
to a million pigeons

  
which support large populations
of raptors

  
But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight

  
further exploited by being bred
for racing

  
means they’re made 
for high speed chases

  
Compared to barn owls
which are a similar size

  
pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved

  
providing extra space for muscle mass

  
They can reach speeds 
of  kilometers per hour

  
And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout

  
While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife

  
we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors

  
In  New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings”

  
and it stuck

  
Indeed their poop

  
which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer presents a unique problem

  
Just one pigeon can leave behind 
 kilograms of acidic excrement per year

  
which in the United States 
scales to about $ billion

  
in structural damage annually

  
Though incidents of infection are rare

  
this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled

  
They may be numerous noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch

  
but the pigeons that swirl around us

  
are evidence of an ancient 
ongoing relationship

  
Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort

  
For better or for worse 
we did this to ourselves

  
The world can be a toxic place

  
No one knows this more
than women and girls

  
cis and trans

  
as well as nonbinary people

  
I am a journalist

  
with  years’ experience

  
reporting on the injustices women
and others face around the world

  
I’m a cofounder of the Man Up Campaign

  
to energize youth activism
against sexual and genderbased violence

  
I’m a father to two daughters

  
I’m a life partner to a woman

  
and I’m a Black man in America

  
Holding these identities 

  
and many more 

  
I say this call to action to you

  
with the deepest sincerity

  
and utmost gravity

  
It is time for a gender reckoning

  
beginning with men authentically
confronting our internal selves

  
and each other

  
through the toxicity within us

  
Against the backdrop
of Black Lives Matter protest

  
cries for a racial reckoning
have echoed throughout the world

  
at times seeming premature

  
and largely misunderstood

  
I believe a true gender reckoning
must be the center

  
of any transformative movement
for social justice and equity

  
But what is a reckoning

  
Dictionaries say it means
to resolve a bill or a debt

  
In other words to settle an account

  
In the case of women and girls

  
what is the debt owed to them

  
Who’s to pay it

  
And how

  
The consequences of male toxicity
continue building

  
the debt to which I refer

  
including among others

  
a gender wealth gap most affecting women
who care for their families

  
as well as act as the primary
income generators

  
for their households

  
Today in the United States and abroad

  
threats to reproductive justice endanger
the lives and hardfought rights of women

  
in regards to their bodily
sexual and gender autonomy

  
impacting the most disenfranchised
community in society

  
And violence against women

  
in all of its forms

  
still represents
an existential challenge

  
as we’ve seen domestic violence
rise in the pandemic

  
as people were confined to their homes

  
we’ve seen online and public
harassment flourish

  
unabated

  
The sexual trafficking

  
prostitution

  
exploitation of women and girls
thrives as ever before

  
From where does this toxicity come

  
and why

  
Men are not endangered

  
we’re not under assault

  
we’re not being unfairly maligned

  
In fact it’s men or certain types of
masculinity that are the issue

  
To be clear

  
being a man does not make me

  
or anyone else who identifies as a man

  
inherently toxic

  
But masculinity

  
in certain forms

  
can harm women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
and men

  
through violence

  
dominating power

  
and control

  
So how do we address this

  
How can we men step up

  
and better support our daughters

  
our sisters

  
our female partners

  
our colleagues neighbors and friends

  
Through what means can men both instigate
and lead a gender reckoning

  
First we must tell the truth

  
We must tell the truth

  
Men grow into this world
becoming who we’re expected to be

  
or who we think we’re expected to be

  
based on cultural expectations

  
and inaccurate historical narratives

  
As a short chubby Black kid
wearing glasses growing up

  
I was repeatedly told I cried too much

  
I’m too emotional

  
too soft

  
It was ingrained in me
that to prove my masculinity

  
I had to display physical prowess 

  
intimidation

  
Because of that indoctrination

  
as an adult

  
I refused to seek help
facing escalating health challenges

  
including high blood pressure

  
and mental trauma

  
The archetype of manhood nearly killed me

  
I say that as a survivor
of two heart attacks

  
four years on dialysis

  
and a kidney transplant 

  
aside from the physical risk
I put myself into

  
covering wars around the world

  
The injury we do to ourselves

  
and the women around us

  
comes from fear of losing control

  
of lack of external affirmation

  
and simply out of shame

  
Manhood is a spectrum of identities

  
There is no one way to be a man

  
And sometimes discovering one’s true
manhood is a lifelong journey

  
Secondly

  
we must be consistent

  
Men

  
especially men of color

  
cannot expect women to stand up for us

  
with us in the face
of systemic oppressions

  
when too often we do not
do the same for them

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
(Applause)

  
The Black Lives Matter
movement for example

  
founded named and led
by queer women of color

  
still centers Black men’s wellbeing

  
in the face of unfair policing

  
and criminal justice systems

  
And where’s the reciprocal
support from those men

  
including myself

  
in addressing intercommunity violence
against women of color

  
maternal health inequity

  
economic disparity

  
How and where do men show up for women

  
I wonder 

  
how many men stood with women
on the steps of the US Supreme Court

  
as they fought for reproductive rights

  
How many men should have been there

  
Finally there can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
There can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
Men who commit acts of violence against
women must be held accountable

  
by formal systems of justice

  
as well as other men

  
Silence in the face of misogynistic
behavior and language is complicity

  
We men need to break free from the pack

  
take concrete actions to stop violence

  
create safety

  
and build equity

  
And most importantly

  
say something

  
To be sure

  
bold men around us are actively working
to disrupt the narrative of male toxicity

  
After the  earthquake in Haiti

  
a local organization

  
KOFAVIV

  
invited men to be defenders of women
and girls in displacement camps

  
women and girls who were
at risk of sexual assault

  
Scores of men answered the call

  
and can continue to do so today

  
In New York City

  
CONNECT NYC

  
led by a Black man

  
actively engages community partners
across civil society

  
to address family violence

  
And in a profession not known generally
for its advocacy against gender violence

  
a professional player
for the Washington Football Team

  
has become an unabashed advocate

  
for men to learn

  
and actively change behaviors
regarding sexual and physical violence

  
There is hope;

  
there is light

  
Men around the world
are putting in the work

  
to catalyze a true gender reckoning

  
But far more are needed

  
What I want to say to you today is this

  
Too many of us 

  
too many men 

  
don’t understand

  
that equity

  
justice

  
inclusivity

  
safety for women girls
and nonbinary people

  
serves and saves us all

  
Broken masculinity harms societies

  
full stop

  
When we men reckon with that truth

  
we will finally find our shared humanity

  
Women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
men

  
standing together on equal footing

  
with mutual respect

  
in safe environments

  
is the greatest
gender reckoning we can create

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Imagine a scientist

  
who wants to send a robot
to explore in a faraway place

  
a place whose geography
might be completely unknown

  
and perhaps inhospitable

  
Now imagine that instead
of first designing that robot

  
and sending it off in the hope
that it might be suitable

  
instead she sends
a robotproducing technology

  
that figures out what kind of robot
is needed once it arrives

  
builds it and then enables it
to continue to evolve

  
to adapt to its new surroundings

  
It’s exactly what my collaborators
and I are working on

  
a radical new technology
which enables robots to be created

  
reproduce and evolve
over long periods of time

  
a technology where robot design
and fabrication becomes a task

  
for machines rather than humans

  
Robots are already all around us
in factories in hospitals in our home

  
But from an engineer's perspective

  
designing a shelfstacking robot
or a Roomba to clean our home

  
is relatively straightforward

  
We know exactly what they need to do

  
and we can imagine the kind of situations
they might find themselves in

  
So we design with this in mind

  
But what if we want
to send that robot to operate

  
in a place that we have little
or even no knowledge about

  
For example cleaning up legacy waste
inside a nuclear reactor

  
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
mining for minerals deep in a trench
at the bottom of the ocean

  
or exploring a faraway asteroid

  
How frustrating would it be
if the humandesigned robot

  
that had taken years
to get to the asteroid

  
suddenly found it needed to drill a hole

  
to collect a sample or clamber up a cliff

  
but it didn't have the right tools

  
or the right means of locomotion to do so

  
If instead we had a technology

  
that enabled the robots to be designed
and optimized in situ

  
in the environment
in which they need to live and work

  
then we could potentially save
years of wasted effort

  
and produce robots
that are uniquely adapted

  
to the environments
that they find themselves in

  
So to realize this technology
we've been turning to nature for help

  
All around us

  
we see examples of biological species

  
that have evolved smart adaptations

  
that enable them to thrive
in a given environment

  
For example in the Cuban rainforest

  
we find vines that have evolved leaves

  
that are shaped like
humandesigned satellite dishes

  
These leaves direct bats to their flowers

  
by amplifying the signals
that the bats send out

  
therefore improving pollination

  
What if we could create
an artificial version of evolution

  
that would enable robots
to evolve in a similar manner

  
as biological organisms

  
I'm not talking about biomimicry

  
a technology which simply copies
what's observed in nature

  
What we're hoping to harness
is the creativity of evolution

  
to discover designs
that are not observed here on Earth

  
the human engineer
might not have thought of

  
or even be capable of conceiving

  
In theory

  
this evolutionary design technology
could operate completely autonomously

  
in a faraway place

  
But equally it could be guided by humans

  
Just as we breed plants for qualities
such as drought resistance or taste

  
the human robot breeder could guide
artificial evolution to producing robots

  
with specific qualities

  
For example

  
the ability to squeeze
through a narrow gap

  
or perhaps operate at low energy

  
This idea of artificial evolution
imitating biological evolution

  
using a computer program

  
to breed better and better solutions
to problems over time

  
isn't actually new

  
In fact artificial evolution

  
algorithms operating inside a computer

  
have been used to design everything
from tables to turbine blades

  
Back in 

  
NASA even sent a satellite into space
with a communication antenna

  
that had been designed
by artificial evolution

  
But evolving robots
is actually much harder

  
than evolving passive objects
such as tables

  
because robots need brains
as well as bodies

  
in order to make sense of the information
in the world around them

  
and translate that
into appropriate behaviors

  
So how do we do it

  
Surprisingly evolution only needs
three ingredients

  
a population of individuals which
exhibit some physical variations;

  
a method of reproduction

  
in which offspring inherit
some traits from their parents

  
and occasionally acquire
new ones via mutation;

  
and finally a means of natural selection

  
So we can replicate these three
ingredients to evolve robots

  
using a mixture of hardware and software

  
The first task is to design
a digital version of DNA

  
That is a digital blueprint that describes
the robot's brain its body

  
its sensory mechanisms
and its means of locomotion

  
Using a randomly generated
set of these blueprints

  
we can create an initial population
of  or more robots

  
to kickstart this evolutionary process

  
We've designed a technology
that can take the digital blueprint

  
and turn it into a physical robot
without any need for human assistance

  
For example it uses a D printer
to print the skeleton of the robot

  
and then an automated assembly arm
like you might find in a factory

  
to add any electronics and moving parts

  
including a small computer
that acts as a brain

  
And to enable this brain to adapt
to the new body of the robot

  
we send every robot produced
to an equivalent of a kindergarten

  
a place where the newborn robot
can refine its motor skills

  
almost like a small child would

  
To mimic natural selection

  
we score these robots
on the ability to conduct a task

  
And then we use these scores

  
to selectively decide
which robots get to reproduce

  
The reproduction mechanism

  
mixes the digital DNA
of the chosen parent robots

  
to create a new blueprint
for a child robot

  
that inherits some of the
characteristics from its parents

  
but occasionally also
exhibits some new ones

  
And by repeating the cycle of selection
and reproduction over and over again

  
we hope that we can breed
successive generations of robots

  
where just like is often observed
in biological evolution

  
each generation gets better than the last

  
with the robots gradually optimizing
their form and their behavior

  
to the task and the environment
that they find themselves in

  
Now although this can all take place

  
in a time frame that's much faster
than biological evolution

  
which sometimes takes thousands of years

  
it's still relatively slow in terms
of the time frames we might expect

  
in our modern world

  
to design and produce an artifact

  
It's mainly due
to the D printing process

  
which can take more
than four hours per robot

  
depending on the complexity
and the shape of the robot

  
But we can give our artificial
evolutionary process a helping hand

  
to reduce the number of physical robots
that we actually need to make

  
We create a digital copy
of every robot produced

  
inside a simulation in a computer

  
and we allow this virtual
population of robots to evolve

  
Now it's quite likely that the simulation
isn't a very accurate representation

  
of the real world

  
But it has an advantage that it enables
models of robots to be created

  
and tested in seconds rather than hours

  
So using the simulator technology

  
we can quickly explore the potential
of a wide range of robot types

  
of different shapes and sizes
of different sensory configurations

  
and quickly get a rough estimate
of how useful each robot may be

  
before we physically make it

  
And we predict that by allowing
a novel form of breeding

  
in which a physical robot can breed
with one of its virtual cousins

  
then the useful traits
that have been discovered in simulation

  
will quickly spread into
the physical robot population

  
where they can be further refined in situ

  
It might sound like science fiction

  
but actually there's a serious point

  
While we expect the technology
that I've just described

  
to be useful in designing robots

  
for example to work in situations
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
or to help us pursue our scientific quest
for exoplanetary exploration

  
there are some more pragmatic reasons

  
why we should consider
artificial evolution

  
As climate change gathers pace

  
it is clear that we need a radical rethink

  
to our approach to robotic
design here on Earth

  
in order to reduce
that ecological footprint

  
For example

  
creating new designs of robot
built from sustainable materials

  
that operate at low energy

  
that are repairable and recyclable

  
It's quite likely that this
new generation of robots

  
won't look anything like the robots
that we see around us today

  
but that's exactly why
artificial evolution might help

  
Discovering novel designs by processes
that are unfettered by the constraints

  
that our own understanding
of engineering science

  
imposes on the design process

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Around the globe

  
there are approximately  million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

  
to escape war violence and persecution

  
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons

  
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries

  
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries

  
They are commonly referred to as refugees

  
But what exactly does that term mean

  
The world has known refugees 
for millennia

  
but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's  Convention

  
relating to the status of refugees

  
in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War

  
It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality

  
and is unable to return 
to their home country

  
because of wellfounded fears
of being persecuted

  
That persecution may be due to their race
religion nationality

  
membership in a particular social group
or political opinion

  
and is often related to war and violence

  
Today roughly half the world's refugees
are children

  
some of them unaccompanied by an adult

  
a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor

  
or sexual exploitation

  
Each refugee's story is different

  
and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes

  
But before we get 
to what their journeys involve

  
let's clear one thing up

  
There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms

  
"migrant" and "refugee"

  
"Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country

  
for reasons not related to persecution

  
such as searching 
for better economic opportunities

  
or leaving droughtstricken areas
in search of better circumstances

  
There are many people around the world
who have been displaced

  
because of natural disasters

  
food insecurities

  
and other hardships

  
but international law rightly or wrongly

  
only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees

  
So what happens when someone
flees their country

  
Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous

  
with limited access to shelter
water or food

  
Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected

  
belongings might be left behind

  
and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents

  
like visas to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries

  
Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling

  
by standard routes

  
This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea

  
and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers

  
to help them cross borders

  
Whereas some people seek safety
with their families

  
others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind

  
with the hopes of being reunited later

  
This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long

  
While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities

  
sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp

  
usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments

  
Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures

  
offering shortterm shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home

  
be integrated to the host country

  
or resettle in another country

  
But resettlement and longterm 
integration options are often limited

  
So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years

  
and sometimes even decades

  
Once in a new country the first legal
step for a displaced person

  
is to apply for asylum

  
At this point they are an asylum seeker

  
and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted

  
While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee

  
every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum

  
and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee

  
Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially

  
Host countries have several duties

  
towards people they have 
recognized as refugees

  
like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and nondiscrimination

  
The most basic obligation towards refugees
is nonrefoulement

  
a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual

  
to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened

  
In reality however refugees are
frequently the victims

  
of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment

  
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia

  
and racism

  
And all too often they aren't permitted
to enter the work force

  
and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid

  
In addition far too many refugee children
are out of school

  
due to lack of funding 
for education programs

  
If you go back in your own family history

  
chances are you will discover that
at a certain point

  
your ancestors were forced 
from their homes

  
either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution

  
It would be good of us to remember
their stories

  
when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced

  
searching for a new home

  
We're going to have hotter
drier summers in our cities

  
We're going to have to deal
with more frequent and intense heat waves

  
It's going to have an impact
on our health and wellbeing

  
but not just us

  
What about the plants and animals
that call our cities home

  
So what could we do about that

  
We could green our cities
we could plant trees

  
The shade provided by trees
provides protection

  
from those impacts of the heat

  
But what do we need to make
those plants thrive and survive

  
We need water

  
Our green cities need water
but mosquitoes also like water

  
And so how can we balance the impacts
that come from both of those

  
if we perhaps are inadvertently
creating increasing pests

  
and public health risks for ourselves

  
in the ways in which we try to respond
to a changing climate

  
How can we green our cities
and not create a problem with mosquitoes

  
The mosquito is the deadliest
animal on the planet

  
About half a million people die every year
because of mosquito bite

  
Diseases such as malaria and dengue

  
infect hundreds of millions
of people every year across the planet

  
That burden of disease
weighs quite heavily

  
on both communities and local authorities

  
as they struggle to try to deal
with those impacts

  
Here in Australia
we're very fortunate to be free

  
of some of the more serious
mosquitoborne diseases

  
but there are still pathogens
spread by local mosquitoes

  
that can make us sick

  
So something like Ross River virus

  
If we get infected with this virus
we may not die

  
but we could get seriously ill

  
Fever rash joint pain fatigue 

  
We could be battling illness
for many months

  
But notwithstanding the burden of disease

  
what about the nuisance that mosquitoes
can have just to our daytoday lives

  
How many of you have been
bothered by mosquitoes

  
when you're outside enjoying the barbecue

  
or visiting the local wetlands
during summer

  
What about that mosquito
that buzzes around your bedroom at night

  
How can we manage these risks
and move forward

  
and try to live in a greener city

  
and not create opportunities
for mosquitoes

  
So I spend my summers
sloshing about in wetlands

  
wrangling mosquitoes

  
Despite the sunburn
and the mosquito bites and the mud

  
I actually do quite like my job

  
And I've also got a confession
to make to you all 

  
I actually quite like mosquitoes

  
(Laughter)

  
I'm quite fascinated by them

  
I think they're actually quite beautiful

  
if you get a chance to look at them
underneath the microscope

  
So before I started my research

  
and first looked through
a microscope at a mosquito

  
I don't think I'd really given them
much of a thought

  
I knew that they were involved
in outbreaks of disease overseas

  
and I was quite familiar with that smell
of a smoldering mosquito coil

  
It still reminds me of summer holidays

  
But the work I do now

  
together with that of scientists
around the country

  
is trying to work out how we can
stop people getting sick

  
because of mosquito bites

  
It requires us to understand

  
the role that mosquitoes have
in our local environment

  
and how we can change our cities

  
so that we're greening our cities

  
we're mitigating those impacts
of climate change

  
but at the same time not creating
opportunities for mosquitoes

  
Did you know there are over 
different types of mosquitoes

  
that are found in Western Sydney

  
So it's not just that one mosquito
that you slap on your arm and squash;

  
they're an incredibly diverse
and interesting range of animals

  
There's  different types
across Western Sydney

  
These mosquitoes might be big
they might be small

  
They might be black
with distinctively striped legs

  
They might be a pale brown color

  
Or they might be
a really vibrant orange color

  
But one of the things I love
about all of these mosquitoes

  
is that they're very unique

  
they've adapted to very different
types of environment

  
It’s one of the reasons that I like them
because they’re incredibly adaptive

  
But it’s also the thing
that worries me about them

  
because they could be adapting
to these sources of water

  
we're creating around our cities

  
So mosquitoes are found in an incredibly
wide range of environments

  
from coastal rock pools

  
to snowmelt streams in our Alpine regions

  
from polluted drains to pristine wetlands

  
and almost every puddle
of water in between

  
There are mosquitoes found
in all of these environments

  
And understanding how the mosquitoes
interact with these environments

  
and the climate

  
is really important to understand
how they might play a role

  
in outbreaks of disease

  
But all of these mosquitoes
essentially need two things

  
they need blood and they need water

  
So I'll get to the blood
in a little while

  
but let me talk to you about why water
is really important for mosquitoes

  
The humble mossie is a really frail
and fragile creature

  
Looks like it'll fall apart
in a strong breeze

  
It's hard to imagine these are the most
dangerous animals on the planet

  
But these animals kind of rely on water;

  
they've got an amazing life cycle
that starts in the water

  
They need water

  
So eggs are laid in and around
sources of water

  
and then when it rains
or tides come into the wetlands

  
these eggs hatch and out of these eggs
hatch these wormlike larvae

  
that swim around in the water

  
Maybe you’ve seen them in puddles
or your pot plant saucers

  
Or maybe as I did as a child

  
if you're a bit slow to clean
your backyard swimming pool

  
when warmer weather arrives

  
all of a sudden
you can see these mosquitoes

  
swimming around at the top of the water

  
But during summer
it might only take a week or so

  
for them to emerge from that water
and start flying around

  
They only live for a few weeks

  
but during that time
they can bite a lot of people

  
and they can lay
more than a thousand eggs

  
But to get those eggs they need blood

  
Mosquitoes need blood
that's why they bite

  
It's only the female mosquito that bites

  
and she needs that protein hit
in her blood to develop her eggs

  
They can live quite happily on plant
juices and sugars most of the time

  
but they really need
that blood to develop eggs

  
And the animals they can get
that blood from can be incredibly varied

  
from cows and kangaroos
to birds to frogs

  
But also us

  
And I know some of us in this room
you're probably thinking

  
"Boy mosquitoes sure like to bite me

  
more than they like to bite my friends"

  
And sometimes we can be
a bit unlucky like that

  
But it's also important to remember
that mosquitoes when they bite

  
can not only create
an itchy red lump on our skin

  
but they can also make us sick

  
They can transmit pathogens
that make us sick

  
But mosquitoes aren’t flying around

  
transferring droplets of infected blood
from person to person

  
These are not dirty syringes;

  
they’re much more complicated organisms

  
So the mosquitoes themselves
have to become infected with the pathogen

  
before they can pass that on to us

  
And when it comes
to pathogen transmission

  
not all mosquitoes are created equal

  
It's why it's really important
to understand mosquitoes

  
because even though we have dozens
of mosquitoes here in Sydney

  
that could transmit
something like Ross River virus

  
there are no mosquitoes
currently in Sydney

  
that can transmit the pathogens
that cause more serious diseases

  
things like dengue chikungunya or Zika

  
Let's hope it stays that way

  
So what does a green city
look like for a mosquito

  
So first of all there are trees
that provide shade

  
protection from wind and sun 

  
It provides these kind of protected
humid little areas

  
where mosquitoes can take refuge

  
The longer mosquitoes live

  
the more people they bite

  
the more eggs they lay

  
But it’s not so much the plants
but the water they need

  
which is really critical for mosquitoes

  
So in a green city we have water tanks

  
we build wetlands

  
We’ve got green walls and frog ponds

  
We’ve got bioretention basins

  
We’ve got rain gardens

  
All of these structures that might be
designed to store and recycle water

  
in and around our cities and suburbs

  
could be used by mosquitoes

  
Remember mosquitoes love this water
that's available to them

  
So how can we design our cities

  
so that mosquitoes aren't quick to adapt
to these types of environments

  
Wherever there's water
mosquitoes will lay eggs

  
and we have to be mindful about that
as we try to respond and green our cities

  
create the structures that will help us

  
It'll make a city greater

  
I want to live in a green city

  
I would love to live in a green city;

  
it's probably great for my physical
and mental health and wellbeing

  
I just don't want to share that
with too many mosquitoes

  
And mosquitoes are so adaptive

  
that I'm sure that they're going
to create opportunities

  
in these structures that we're building

  
and so I'm really worried

  
that we're going to see
more and more mosquitoes into the future

  
So how do you create a wetland
that's not home to mosquitoes

  
One of the really interesting pieces
of research we've found in recent years

  
is that problematic mosquito populations

  
often seem to be associated
with wetlands of poor health

  
wetlands that have more stagnant water

  
wetlands that don't have enough predators
to eat the mosquitoes

  
So it’s a tantalizing idea

  
that if you can create
a wetland that's healthier

  
it has more water flow

  
it has a greater level of biodiversity

  
you can actually keep
mosquito populations down

  
If you provide habitats
for the animals that eat mosquitoes 

  
the birds the bats
the fish the frogs the spiders

  
any number of aquatic insects
that love munching on mosquitoes 

  
rather than being a problem

  
mosquitoes are not going to disappear

  
we're not going to get rid
of mosquitoes completely

  
but if they're at a more balanced
place in the ecosystem

  
maybe we'll have fewer pest impacts

  
and more importantly

  
maybe we will see less
mosquitoborne disease

  
But what about stormwater drains

  
These are already a common sight
in our local wetlands

  
and there's a mosquito
that calls these habitats home

  
which you all already know

  
You may not notice it
when it flies past you

  
but you know its sound

  
You've probably learned to hate
the sound of this mosquito

  
more so than its bite

  
This is a mosquito called
the brown house mosquito

  
It loves breeding in polluted ponds
and pipes and waterways;

  
it's going to be quick to exploit

  
the ways in which we store
wastewater in our cities

  
The thing is about this mosquito

  
is that it loves coming indoors at night

  
It's the mosquito that's going to be
buzzing around your face at night

  
keep you awake disrupting your sleep

  
Now the reason you can hear that mosquito

  
is not because it makes a sound
that's different to any other mosquito

  
It's just that a mosquito
prefers to bite birds

  
and so it's flying
around your face and your body

  
responding to your heat
and the smell of your skin working out

  
"Is this a large featherless bird

  
I'm not sure whether
I want to bite it or not"

  
It's bad luck for those of you
who smell a bit like a bird

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's a reminder that sometimes

  
it's not just the bite of mosquitoes
that's the problem

  
it's the disturbance that can be caused
by large numbers of mosquitoes

  
And so we don't want these mosquitoes
coming inside our homes

  
where we're kind of creating opportunities
for these mosquitoes in our cities

  
So what about our backyards

  
We all want to keep our backyards healthy

  
we want to have a great opportunity
for our plants and our pets

  
and the local wildlife

  
One effective way to do that
is installing a rainwater tank

  
Problem is rainwater tanks
can be a great source

  
for very serious mosquitoes

  
You all in this room
have probably been bitten

  
by the Australian backyard mosquito

  
Its scientific name is Aedes notoscriptus

  
It is the most widespread
mosquito in Australia;

  
almost everybody has opportunities
for this mosquito in their backyard

  
Whether it's a birdbath
a pot plant saucer

  
even the smallest volumes of water
trapped in a waterholding container

  
will be a place this mosquito
can lay its eggs

  
It's a nuisance biting pest

  
but it's not a serious threat
to our health

  
But there's a problem here

  
because these same habitats
where this mosquito is found

  
could also be the home of a mosquito

  
that's associated with the transmission
of much more serious pathogens

  
pathogens that can cause
outbreaks of disease

  
such as dengue chikungunya and Zika

  
These mosquitoes
are the Asian tiger mosquito

  
or the yellow fever mosquito

  
These two mosquitoes are not found
in Sydney at the moment

  
but worldwide they contribute to major
outbreaks of mosquitoborne disease

  
They don't breed in wetlands

  
they love these waterholding
containers in our backyards

  
And as we do a better job
of creating these opportunities

  
like rainwater tanks in our backyards

  
maybe we're creating an opportunity
for these mosquitoes to move in

  
The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti

  
was actually once common in Sydney

  
but during the 's it disappeared

  
One of the reasons for its disappearance

  
could well have been the fact
that we moved away from rainwater tanks

  
And now rainwater tanks are coming back

  
They're going to become more common

  
And could that see the return
of these mosquitoes

  
I certainly hope not

  
So what can authorities do
about reducing the mosquitoes

  
associated with these greening cities
that we're dealing with

  
There's a role for our local authorities

  
to consider mosquitoes
when they're building wetlands

  
creating wastewater recycling schemes

  
regulating the installation
of rainwater tanks

  
Because these are dynamic systems

  
It's not just about
how you design them and build them

  
but it's how you maintain them

  
You can't just build them and walk away

  
because as we've learned

  
if these habitats degrade
they become more suitable for mosquitoes

  
These types of structures

  
these wetlands
in our cities they're great

  
They help reduce pollution
they help store water

  
but we don't want them to become
an opportunity for mosquitoes

  
But what about us

  
There's a role for local government
for our local authorities

  
but how an we help protect
our families and our friends

  
from the impact of mosquitoes
associated with a greening city

  
I'm going to leave you with three tips

  
that can help you stop
the bite of mosquitoes

  
and the buzz of mosquitoes this summer

  
First of all

  
don't create opportunities
for mosquitoes in your backyard

  
Anything that traps water after rainfall
will be a source of mosquitoes

  
so tip out cover up or remove
these waterholding containers

  
in your backyard

  
Screen your rainwater tanks

  
Clean your gutters and your drains

  
reduce that standing water
that mosquitoes love so much

  
around our homes

  
Secondly

  
insect repellents are a safe
and effective way

  
to avoid mosquito bites

  
When you're choosing a formulation

  
from the local pharmacy
or the supermarket

  
make sure you apply it
as a nice even coat

  
over all exposed areas of skin

  
Don't put it on like perfume

  
A dab here or there
is not going to provide protection

  
Unless you've got complete cover
those mosquitoes will find a way

  
to find that gap
in your repellent and bite

  
Lastly a way that you might be able
to stop the buzz of mosquitoes

  
Why not just switching on a fan

  
We know that operating a fan in a bedroom
can help reduce those mosquitoes

  
that come in and buzz around
our ears at night

  
It disperses the smells
and the temperatures

  
around that body that attracts them;

  
it might make it a bit harder
for that mossie

  
to fly around and find us as well

  
So finally I want to leave you
with a thought

  
We may hate mosquitoes and I understand

  
I don’t want to convert you
into loving these bloodsuckers

  
But we need to understand them

  
Because if we can’t understand
the diversity of mosquitoes

  
and their relationships
with the environments

  
we’re creating in our green cities

  
it's going to become
a much greater struggle

  
to kind of reduce the burden of disease
that might come with them

  
And unfortunately

  
mosquitoes are going to be
yet another challenge we face

  
as we move forward into our future cities

  
under the impact of a changing climate

  
As a new widow Sarah Rosas Garcia

  
was already struggling to support
her nine children

  
when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities

  
Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school

  
and being sexually promiscuous

  
so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents

  
committed her to a state hospital

  
After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score

  
the doctors made their verdict

  
They told Sara her yearold daughter
would be sterilized

  
to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency

  
This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime

  
But in fact it took place 
in Southern California in 

  
And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color

  
targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics

  
Since ancient Greece there have been
efforts to control human populations

  
via reproduction retaining some
traits and removing others

  
But in the th century the discovery
of evolution and genetics

  
inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor

  
In  British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton

  
named this idea eugenics

  
drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born”

  
This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists

  
and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society

  
by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down

  
However their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable

  
was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era

  
Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction

  
including immigrants people of color
and people with disabilities

  
Meanwhile their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members

  
white Europeans
of Nordic or AngloSaxon descent

  
As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early th century

  
many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions

  
These measures to improve socalled
“racial hygiene”

  
were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany

  
The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews

  
as well as individuals from other groups

  
including Roma gay men 
and people with disabilities

  
Outside their extreme brutality however

  
Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe

  
Throughout the midth century

  
many countries enacted eugenics policies

  
and governments in Sweden 
Canada and Japan

  
forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals

  
Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US

  
From  to 

  
US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over  people

  
with  states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization

  
for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective”

  
This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses

  
and the results of IQ tests

  
which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations

  
These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California

  
From  to  Latina women were 
% more likely to be sterilized

  
than other women

  
And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high—

  
this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations

  
Such was the case of Andrea Garcia

  
whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates

  
With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus

  
Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law

  
violated the US Constitution

  
depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law

  
However while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea

  
the other two did not

  
Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery

  
but many more victims 
of these policies did not

  
Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations

  
after the horrors of World War II

  
many of its practices including
sterilization continued for decades

  
By the late s research 
into human genetics was more nuanced

  
and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence

  
Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization

  
well into the s

  
Finally class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers

  
and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 

  
Unfortunately today

  
the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities

  
still continues around the globe

  
Anna Malaika Tubbs "The Three Mothers"

  
is about Alberta King
Berdis Baldwin and Louise Little

  
the mothers of MLK Jr
James Baldwin and Malcolm X

  
And I wrote this book

  
to not only celebrate
these three incredible life stories

  
that we should have known
for years and years before my book

  
but to also think about what their stories
could symbolize for Black women

  
Black mothers mothers more generally

  
and what it could mean
to save their stories

  
from being forgotten from being erased

  
and how it changes our understanding
of where we are as a nation today

  
how we have arrived here

  
what are changes
that we still need to make

  
Whitney Pennington Rogers That's great

  
I think in reading it

  
you can feel how really lovingly
you put all of this together

  
and did this research and the attention
that you put to this

  
this really comes through
in the finished product

  
Well we have we have
a question from Jeff

  
Jeff says that "As a father
this talk changed my life

  
I bought the book a few copies
and was in the audience in December live

  
and it generated this concern for me

  
How much history was impacted
with lack of mother's input

  
especially Black mothers”

  
And that's the question

  
AMT Oh it's a big question

  
First thank you Jeff
I really appreciate that

  
So much of our history
we are missing these stories

  
And the feeling that you felt
in being in that audience

  
and that I felt
in uncovering these stories

  
and every piece of the puzzle that I found

  
just really shocked me

  
that we didn't know these things
already and infuriated me

  
And it really caused me some deep sadness

  
because I realized
how many more stories are 

  
I mean we're missing so many

  
and of course not everybody
is going to be famous

  
and not everyone’s going to have
a book written about them

  
But it's very very unique this erasure
of Black women's contributions

  
It is very intentional

  
Like I said with "Hidden
Figures" as an example

  
why would we not know that Black women
were the mathematicians

  
called "the computers"
behind a space launch

  
That is critical information
for our history

  
And for me to think
as a young Black woman

  
when I was sitting in school

  
when I was a young Black girl

  
what that could have meant
to me to know that

  
That it was a part not only of 

  
I could not be the first Black
woman to do something

  
but that there was a history before me

  
of Black female mathematicians

  
and these brilliant brains

  
And even as much as you know

  
my parents educated me on my Black
history and my African history

  
because even I have a privilege
that many Black Americans do not have

  
I knew my connection
to my lineage in Ghana etc

  
So much of this history
has been robbed from us

  
And it's a very strategic robbing

  
It's not a mistake

  
So that just thinking
from that perspective

  
we want to continue to uncover
more and more stories

  
of those who have been
intentionally marginalized

  
intentionally oppressed

  
Because the more we can correct
our telling of that story

  
and that history

  
the better we'll do moving forward

  
So these attacks on telling history
right now it's very strategic

  
It’s not again a mistake

  
It's not something
that people are doing unconsciously

  
It’s very “We don’t want
to tell the truth”

  
And we all need to reckon with that

  
and we need to fight against that

  
WPR I think that it's really
interesting in the book

  
that you draw these parallels
between what was happening

  
in the lives of these three women

  
and what we're seeing happening you know

  
play out in the news today

  
or have seen happen at other
moments in history during their lives

  
And you know I'm curious
to hear how you think

  
writing this book changed your perspective

  
on the experiences of mothers currently

  
just how you think about motherhood today

  
AMT Yeah this is something
that I already knew was an issue

  
Going back to my mom
she would always say

  
in every place that we travel
to pay attention

  
to how women are being treated
in the society

  
how mothers very specifically
are being treated

  
That is an indicator on how successful
this community will be

  
And so I always carry that
in the back of my mind

  
I was always aware that
when I moved back to the US for instance

  
that we weren’t really giving mothers
the support that they deserved;

  
we certainly weren’t giving them
the celebration that they deserve

  
and therefore the support was lacking

  
And there was this lack of understanding

  
around the critical
importance of the role

  
But in putting this book out there
and even doing the TED Talk

  
and speaking to so many different
audiences around this

  
it is a dire situation for mothers

  
And whether that's on a personal level

  
where those who have come up
to me and said

  
“I am the mom who feels
unappreciated in my household right now”

  
“I am the mom who feels unseen”

  
To this national level of a crisis

  
where we are fighting for weeks
of parental leave

  
mere weeks

  
This is 

  
It’s upsetting

  
and we should be embarrassed by that

  
These are things that should
have been established by now

  
and I really do 
and I say this in the TED Talk 

  
I truly hope that within my lifetime

  
we can usher in a shift that starts with
first saying “Mothers are essential”

  
We need mothers to be supported

  
because they are holding
so much of our lives together

  
our society together

  
Stayathome moms are performing some
of the most important work in our country

  
and we are devaluing them

  
And not only that we are making them
feel bad about what they are doing

  
This really is an issue
that more of us need to take on

  
Going back to that very first question

  
why this is an issue
for everybody to care about

  
And it sounds obvious

  
but we shouldn't have to say
that if mothers are dying

  
in a maternal health crisis 

  
one that is exacerbated for Black women 

  
the Black maternal health
crisis is alarming

  
but generally the maternal
health crisis in the US is terrible

  
It shouldn't be this way

  
Mothers of all races are dying
more than they should be

  
We need to pay attention to that

  
That's not only bad
for mothers obviously

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to walk away
from their job during the pandemic

  
because there were no supports
in place to catch them

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to choose
between being a mother

  
or making money for their family

  
That shouldn't be put on their shoulders

  
There should be supports in place

  
We should have affordable child care

  
We should have universal preschool

  
All of these things that impact mothers
have ripple effects for the rest of us

  
So yes it opened my eyes
to just how alarming

  
and how critical a situation
we're currently in

  
Even though again my mom raised me
to know all of these things

  
Through doing this work

  
I’ve just now been kind of
awoken to the need

  
for people to open their eyes right now

  
WPR M Watson has a question
that actually kind of piggybacks on this

  
more than just thinking about how
we can gain access to these stories

  
they want to know you know

  
what do you feel is the most
effective way we can as a people

  
change the narrative around Black women

  
You know if you have
any specific examples

  
which I know you share some in your talk

  
They ask

  
"How can I personally be involved
in this work of changing this narrative"

  
AMT Great question
and there are levels to this

  
I would say definitely
understanding the history

  
of how Black women
have been treated is very important

  
So again it's a shameless plug
but read the book

  
I talk about not only these three women

  
but again many of the goals that I had

  
one of them also was to explain tropes

  
like the mammy and the matriarch trope

  
and the Jezebel trope

  
and the "welfare queen"
and the strong Black woman trope

  
What all of these have meant
in American history

  
and what their intention was

  
And that is to say that anything
Black women were dealing with

  
was their own fault

  
That with the mammy trope
that we didn't deserve necessarily

  
to be compensated for work
that we were doing

  
that we deserved to stay
within domestic work

  
and that we shouldn't necessarily
be paid what that work was worth

  
because we liked it
and we were happy to be the mammy

  
The Aunt Jemima who was smiling
and wanted to do you know

  
wanted to serve her white family
more than her own

  
The matriarch trope that Black families
have been separated from each other

  
not because of systems
that have made it so that 

  
you know mass incarceration

  
or so many other things
that I can mention

  
but instead because Black women
were emasculating their men

  
Or the Jezebel trope that justified
sexual violence against Black women

  
because that's what Black women wanted

  
they were more promiscuous

  
Even the "welfare queen"

  
saying Black women are having children
just to make money

  
So you have to understand
this is a very long

  
ugly painful history

  
that we are dealing with as Black women
day in and day out

  
And when people don’t get

  
that those are the burdens we are holding

  
years and centuries of being told
that everything that's happening to you

  
the pain you're going through
is because of you

  
and not because of policies
we've voted for

  
or the ways in which we kept you
from being elected

  
or even being able to run for office

  
or even vote

  
That's where it really begins

  
Take the time as much as you can to know
how we've gotten to where it is right now

  
and then to really have a moment
where you fully appreciate

  
the incredible resistance of Black women

  
and the ways in which
we've continued to create life

  
despite the ways that people
have tried to rob it from us

  
And the vision behind what Black women
have been able to accomplish

  
what they have imagined for this world

  
because we can't accept
the situation as it is right now

  
because that dehumanize us

  
But we have pushed this nation forward
to our vision in incredible ways

  
It's not only Stacey Abrams in Georgia

  
it's a long long history
of Black women saying

  
"We don't agree
with the system as it is now

  
So here is how we're going to
help you see the world

  
and the possibilities
from our perspective"

  
And you look at American history
from that angle

  
and it is powerful

  
There is nothing like it

  
And therefore you better understand
why we should elect more Black women

  
why we should vote for them

  
to help usher our country
and continue to do it

  
But with even more support
and even more backing

  
because without that backing
without that support

  
when Black women have been erased
and misrecognized misrepresented

  
we have still created incredible change

  
So now we're asking that we be heard

  
we be listened to

  
and that our energy no longer be spent
on explaining how we got here

  
but instead on how we can do
whatever is next and whatever is possible

  
So it’s kind of a combination
of try to learn our history

  
support us as leaders

  
put those tools in our hands
as much as possible

  
Trust us hear us believe us

  
and also stop wasting our time
on the need to explain the extra

  
when that's work
that we can do on our own

  
That kind of brings me
full circle to my research

  
being around

  
I didn't reach out to the family
until I'd done my part

  
So yeah I mean even attending
a conversation like this

  
is part of doing your part
so kudos to you all

  
We're all real starting today

  
WPR And that's doing your part
to sort to educate yourself

  
on information that already
exists out there it sounds like

  
Beyond what we could do individually
to educate ourselves

  
and make change in this space

  
what can we expect from our government

  
to do more on the national scale

  
and even thinking globally

  
What are some things
that you would like to see

  
so that we change the way
that we as a culture

  
think about Black motherhood

  
AMT For this one

  
because I'll give it quicker answer
than I have in me

  
because you can tell I like to talk
and I can go for a long time

  
But in the book

  
the concluding chapter is entirely
about what we need to do as a world

  
and what are the lessons that Alberta

  
Berdis and Louise’s lives are teaching us
about our next steps forward

  
when it comes to policy
when it comes to 

  
actually even kind of
the threelevel layer

  
that I like to talk about

  
which is the interpersonal level
is an important one

  
The conversations
that we're having with each other

  
and the stories that we're telling

  
when I you know
in the TED Talk a little snippet

  
where we have mothers who feel
like they have to be selfless

  
and that we celebrate mothers
for being selfless

  
So even around Mother's Day
we say to moms

  
"Thank you for sacrificing
everything for me

  
and for putting yourself
behind everybody"

  
And yes a lot of mothers have done that

  
and certainly if they have
we should thank them for that

  
But what we can start to do is shift
that story and that thank you

  
and say "Thank you for doing
everything you could do for us

  
And also thank you for still seeing
yourself as a human being"

  
or "for representing yourself as a human
with a full range of emotions

  
and for teaching me
about my first life lessons

  
for being my first caretaker

  
for being my first leader
for being my first teacher"

  
Those are things that I think
more accurately represent mothering

  
in a way that is sustainable for mothers

  
Where mothers aren't going to burn out

  
where we're not putting all of it on moms

  
and then reiterating it by saying

  
"Thank you for putting yourself
behind everyone else"

  
So that's on like an interpersonal level

  
I do think those conversations
can make a huge difference

  
in terms of what mothers
are even thinking is the goal

  
of what we're trying to achieve

  
and what we want to be thanked for

  
The second level of that is
you know in relationships

  
even beyond our households 

  
And I mean like you said
in terms of Black motherhood

  
very specifically

  
this burden of putting
our needs behind everyone

  
I just did a piece
for “New York” magazine on this

  
that that is further
exacerbated for Black women

  
because we have been seen
as "the mothers" of a movement

  
We're always like mothers
of something much larger

  
and not just like mothers
of our own children

  
but this weight of what's placed upon us

  
And specifically in this article

  
I'm focusing on mothers
whose children have been killed

  
whether by police officers
or neighborhood vigilantes

  
and how in these moments

  
instead of giving these moms
the space to grieve

  
we're asking them to do something
for our entire country

  
You know we ask them to speak to crowds

  
they run for office which can be a part
of their personal healing as well

  
but we interpret that as look at what
this Black woman is doing for all of us

  
rather than us thinking about what is
she going to do for her own healing

  
for her own restoration

  
So that's kind of
the extra layer to that

  
And then thinking about it
on a national level

  
what we're voting for

  
I think about what could
have helped Alberta Berdis and Louise

  
and what we still need
to this day right now

  
So to give a little bit more
information on the women

  
Alberta King had to walk
away from her job

  
because the law stated at the time

  
that married women
were not allowed to teach

  
and she'd always had this dream
of being an educator

  
She had a bachelor's degree
she had a teaching certificate

  
but when she met her husband

  
she made the decision to start a family

  
because this was like
she had to make a decision

  
And even though that law
the marriage bar is not in place now

  
what are the many ways in which
we're pushing women and mothers

  
out of their jobs

  
There are many that still exist
and we need to start addressing those

  
These are just one example
from each woman

  
If we look at Berdis Baldwin

  
she was the victim of an abusive husband
for years years and years

  
And James Baldwin speaks about this often
how abusive his stepfather was

  
But she didn't have anyone
she could really turn to

  
because especially in Black communities

  
we are so afraid of what might happen
if we call a police officer

  
and we have multiple examples of this

  
where we really needed
help and intervention

  
and then somebody ends up
being shot when they're called

  
when police officers
are called to protect us

  
So Berdis Baldwin was aware of this

  
Her children had been harassed
by police officers

  
James Baldwin tells a story
of when he was pushed into an alley

  
and he was maybe  years old
and police officers searched him

  
they were looking for someone

  
and just left him there
on his own this little boy

  
So she's not going to call them
to help her in this situation

  
So she just endures this abuse
all on her own

  
So what are systems we can think about

  
in terms of should there be
other people we can call

  
who are not police officers

  
Should there be you know

  
more support even for social workers
that could come out

  
That's something to think about
and to reflect on

  
And then as an example for Louise Little

  
I mean all three of them have
these different painful traumas

  
that they experience

  
And for Louise one of the major ones

  
is that she is put in an institution
against her will for  years of her life

  
because she was this activist
radical activist

  
who spoke up against white supremacy

  
who stands and facesoff
with the KKK literally

  
And a white male physician was sent
to her house to evaluate her

  
after her husband had been murdered

  
And he concludes that she's
experiencing dementia

  
And in his doctor's note
he says that she is quote

  
"imagining being discriminated against"

  
"Imagining being discriminated against"

  
as a Black woman

  
Black immigrant woman
living in the Midwest

  
and that is enough to put her away
in an institution against her will

  
So in terms of us thinking
about the biases

  
that Black women are facing
when they don't ask for help even

  
and people just decide they're going
to come in and evaluate them

  
especially even when they do
that they're going to be misunderstood

  
that they're going to be told
they're imagining things

  
these are things we need to address

  
So we also have to do an evaluation
of our health care systems

  
and the biases that still exist

  
So it's kind of like this endless list

  
and I definitely don't want to end
on such a heavy and hard note

  
But in that concluding chapter

  
it's called "Our Lives
Will Not Be Erased"

  
that's where I go with it is policy

  
and what we can do

  
Kind of some tangible next steps

  
WPR Well I think that's
so important and so valuable

  
And to your point of not ending
in such a heavy place you know

  
I guess how do you feel though
about the progress we are making

  
M Watson asks do you feel

  
that the Black women
narrative is progressing

  
AMT I am an optimist

  
and I often say that my optimism
lies in this incredible activism

  
that Black women have held for so long

  
and we continue to envision
new realities for this world

  
And that makes me really hopeful

  
To study Alberta Berdis and Louise
who again it's not ancient history

  
Berdis passed away in 

  
Louise passed away in 

  
So this isn't like ancient
ancient history

  
but they did face a lot of things
that I no longer face

  
as a result of their work

  
and a result of what
they were able to accomplish

  
and how they taught their children
to accomplish these things

  
and change the world

  
So I'm not the kind of person
who thinks we are stuck

  
and there is no forward progress
that we've made

  
I feel like that would be really
disrespectful to them if I felt that way

  
because they gave as much
as they could to that progression

  
and it's my turn to carry
that forward as well

  
But what I do hope is that more
people join us in this

  
and that Black women are not continuing
to have to do this on our own

  
That more people will be aware of history

  
I sound like a broken record

  
but be aware of history
so that we can move forward

  
and fight anything that tries
to keep us from telling accurate

  
and full representations
of our country's history

  
Because I think if we're aware of it
then we won't want to repeat it

  
And we have more people who will want
to be allies in this fight

  
And in my contribution to this

  
I'm just hoping I'm giving more of us
tools to join the conversation

  
and think about how we can
carry it forward

So when I was  years old

  
I was a lonely geeky girl;

  
a firstgeneration Latina growing up
in a small Midwestern town

  
where hardly anyone else
had parents who spoke with thick accents

  
But then I came across
Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy

  
“The Lord of the Rings”

  
and I fell in love

  
(Applause)

  
What a cool world of elves

  
orcs

  
and small but heroic hobbits
fighting against impossible odds

  
to defeat a powerful enemy

  
Kind of like life

  
But one thing bothered me

  
There weren’t enough
female characters in this book

  
The adventurers accompanying
the protagonists were all male

  
It made me feel left out

  
like I did in school when 

  
you’re not going to believe this 

  
when my th grade teacher told me

  
“Why are you working so hard in math

  
You should be getting a boyfriend!”

  
(Audience boos)

  
But worse it offended
my sense of fairness

  
Surely girls could have adventures too

  
So what could I do

  
I sat down with my spiral notebook

  
and I rewrote the story

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I regendered a couple
of the main characters

  
and I added new scenes

  
like one where a female hobbit
devised a clever plan

  
to foil the Balrog

  
a monster who caused the death
of one of my favorite characters

  
By reimagining Tolkien’s fantasy world

  
I was creating a place

  
where someone like me could feel at home

  
Writing my story gave me comfort

  
But it also taught me a lot
about how to write

  
I never shared that spiral
notebook with anyone

  
But what I didn’t realize then

  
was I was writing something
called fanfiction 

  
(Laughter)

  
a story based on characters
or settings from another’s work 

  
and that I was not alone

  
It was an experience I never forgot

  
And many years later

  
after I became a data science professor
at the University of Washington

  
in 

  
I met another professor named Katie Davis

  
and we sat down over lunch

  
and discussed a recent news story

  
that claimed “kids today can’t write

  
all they produce
is misspelled short texts”

  
Katie and I didn’t believe it

  
We both knew kids whose writing abilities
defied these stereotypes

  
What’s more the talented young people
we happened to know

  
all had heavy involvement
in fanfiction reading and writing

  
So this apparent contradiction
sparked our exploration

  
into one of my most enduring
research projects

  
a deep data dive

  
into the vast world of fanfiction

  
to study the impact

  
that writing these stories
could have on the writers themselves

  
and whether writing fanfiction
could actually teach kids

  
to become stronger writers

  
And what we found surpassed
anything I could have imagined

  
So let me set the stage

  
For those of you who haven’t
heard the term before

  
fanfiction

  
sometimes known
as transformative literature

  
is said by some to go back centuries

  
After all in the s

  
John Milton wrote “Paradise Lost”
using characters from the Bible

  
(Laughter)

  
But today scholars generally feel

  
that modern fanfiction
traces its origins to typewritten zines

  
written by “Star Trek” fans
in the ‘s and’ s

  
And with the growth of the internet

  
barriers to sharing
have been lowered further

  
Millions of people are writing
and sharing fan fiction

  
on a variety of websites

  
around existing plots like “Harry Potter”

  
“Twilight”

  
“Naruto”

  
“My Little Pony” 

  
(Laughter)

  
and “Pokémon”

  
and many others

  
You probably have
a teenage relative or neighbor

  
who reads or writes fanfiction

  
These stories are wildly diverse

  
and may be creative
thoughtful or hilarious

  
You might find titles like

  
“When Harry Potter
Accidentally Started a Cult”

  
(Laughter)

  
Or “Five Times Hermione Snogged Harry 

  
(Laughter)

  
And One Time She Didn’t”

  
(Laughter)

  
The sheer quantity of fanfiction
that’s been produced is astonishing

  
In the past  years alone

  
over  billion words of fanfiction
have been written

  
and posted on a single online site

  
fanfictionnet

  
which is only one
of many fanfiction hubs

  
Now compare that with the amount
of fiction written in the English language

  
that’s been traditionally published

  
in all of human history 

  
 billion

  
So this is an incredible
outpouring of creativity

  
And on this site it's written
primarily by young people

  
This site’s  million members
write in  different languages

  
and their median age is  and a half

  
Most of the authors are between  and 

  
and most are teenage girls

  
 percent identify as female

  
and interestingly

  
more fanfiction authors identify
as gender nonconforming than male

  
Authors we interviewed
told us they wrote fan fiction

  
because they love
the characters and worlds

  
And over and over again

  
they told us how much
they learned about writing

  
from participating in these communities

  
Here’s an example

  
One author told us she started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
when she had this intense crush
on a fictional character

  
(Sighs)

  
It led her to write fanfiction
with phrases like

  
“gorgeous cerulean orbs” or

  
(Laughter)

  
“manly hunks of muscle”

  
(Laughter)

  
Kind of embarrassing

  
(Laughter)

  
And she told us

  
“But reviewers were kind enough

  
to be positive about
my amateurish fangirl postings

  
mostly because they also
like this character

  
But they also pointed out
my uses of clichés and overwriting

  
As a result I learned to be sensitive
to these types of bad writing

  
Today I publish original fiction

  
and no one has ever called me out
on a florid writing style”

  
She concluded with

  
“I think if a teacher had simply
redpencilied my childish scribbles

  
I might have been so discouraged
as to never write again”

  
Another author

  
who later became our student

  
told us that she learned about spelling
and grammar while writing fan fiction

  
But she also told us

  
“When I started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
I was a queer autistic middleschooler

  
who hadn’t yet realized
I was either of these things

  
I had difficulty with social situations

  
Fanfiction communities
were a vital social and learning outlet”

  
Today she’s done something
that few undergraduates ever have

  
She’s published a first author
academic paper in a toprated venue

  
(Applause)

  
After studying many individual
writers’ stories over time

  
we came to see that these personal stories
were consistent with the data

  
The young writers’ use of words
grew more diverse

  
as they received more reviews

  
So how did these kids learn

  
and from whom

  
To find out

  
we did a deeper dive into mentoring
in fanfiction communities

  
Now we expected to find traditional
mentormentee pairs

  
older or more experienced authors
mentoring younger

  
or less experienced ones

  
But what we found
was completely different

  
We found millions of authors
and readers communicating

  
via multiple channels

  
and reviewing each other’s work

  
regardless of experience level

  
People of all ages listening to
and reviewing each other’s stories

  
This was so cool we had to give it a name

  
so we call it “distributed mentoring”

  
You can also think of it
as nanomentoring

  
Each piece of mentoring
is tiny on its own

  
but the combination of all of it
is much greater than the sum of its parts

  
A key attribute of distributed
mentoring is its abundance

  
One author we interviewed

  
who wrote both traditionally
published fiction and fan fiction

  
told us that she received
more feedback in a single week

  
on her fanfiction

  
than she did in two years
on her published novel

  
It’s a difference not only of degree

  
but also of kind

  
By itself a single comment
on a story such as “loved it”

  
is relatively meaningless

  
but hundreds or thousands
provide valuable feedback

  
Like 

  
“I like the ambiguity of your ending 

  
it leaves me feeling hopeful”

  
and others like these

  
Reviewers build on
and reference each other’s comments

  
This enables authors to piece together

  
an overall view of their writing
that’s supportive as well as constructive

  
We found only one percent of comments
constituted bullying

  
And these are anonymous

  
This is a surprisingly low number

  
as anybody who has read comments
on an internet platform knows

  
What’s more

  
we found the supportive nature
of most of these comments was critical

  
in writing development

  
One author who was Black

  
made all the characters
from a popular TV show Black

  
She got comments filled
with readers’ sense of freedom

  
and delight from reading her story

  
It not only encouraged her
to keep writing

  
it gave her the conviction
that what she was doing was worthwhile

  
And so through this research

  
Katie and I found ourselves

  
not only believing
that yes kids can be good writers

  
but also that fanfiction

  
and distributed mentoring
could be used in formal education

  
A report from the National Assessment
of Educational Progress

  
found that a whopping
 percent of US students

  
in grades eight and 
lack proficiency in writing

  
Research has shown
that adolescence is a wonderful time

  
to improve your writing skills

  
and the popularity of fanfiction
in this age group shows

  
what an opportunity there is
to use it as a learning tool

  
So here's how I'm imagining it

  
Students with similar interests
from school districts across the country

  
could be connected with one another
to get and give anonymous feedback

  
on their writing

  
It must be anonymous

  
I know this from personal experience

  
Teachers could moderate the channels
to make sure feedback was constructive

  
as well as helping students learn from it

  
If this work grew burdensome for teachers

  
hierarchical moderation could help

  
which is a system where members
themselves can report negative

  
or abusive comments

  
and volunteer moderators
from among the students could decide

  
which ones to delete

  
with teachers weighing in
only when necessary

  
This technique is used
in many large online communities

  
and lots of adolescents
are familiar with it

  
Fanfiction is a private universe
that’s become a welcoming community

  
particularly for those
from marginalized groups

  
This vast and vibrant resource

  
for kids who have something to say

  
is especially meaningful to me

  
when I contrast it
with the isolation I encountered

  
growing up Latina in the US

  
And sometimes

  
I wonder what would have been
different in my own life

  
and maybe in many other people’s lives

  
if only we could have access
to this supportive community

  
of millions of young people

  
and their distributing mentoring

  
as kids

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
The last time I addressed
this august TED crowd was in 

  
from the main stage in Vancouver

  
where I was giving my first TED Talk
on the case for having children

  
And that's where I shared the news
I had just received earlier in the week

  
that my then twoyearold
daughter Nusayba

  
was diagnosed with stage IV cancer
and needed a full liver transplant

  
So how have your past three years been

  
As you can imagine

  
our last three years have been eventful

  
However they have given me some tough

  
learned lived experiences and lessons

  
about this ephemeral thing we call hope

  
And apparently there is a huge demand
for hope right now

  
In 

  
we're all dealing with multiple crises

  
A pandemic has killed  Americans

  
there's a partial lockdown
there's disinformation

  
there's income inequality

  
the rise of white supremacy
people telling people like me

  
“Go back to where you came from”

  
We have to learn new Greek letters
every few months

  
and oh yeah there's climate change

  
But other than that
things are pretty peachy

  
And with all of that you might be asking

  
“Well then why should we be hopeful
in such hopeless times Wajahat”

  
And that is a very valid question

  
And it's a perfectly fair question

  
But hope is what allowed me to believe
that my daughter would somehow survive

  
And she did

  
And so if I may allow me to share briefly

  
three pieces of advice or lessons

  
or things that we can do

  
that gave me hope in hopeless times

  
and that I hope can help you

  
Number one

  
Tie your camel first

  
There's a great saying in Islam

  
many Muslims know this

  
that have faith in God
but tie your camel first

  
As a dad

  
I felt utterly hopeless
with Nusayba's cancer

  
I'm the dad I'm supposed to fix things

  
But I couldn't fix cancer

  
Cancer plays for all the marbles

  
It's a relentless brutal
remorseless killing machine

  
It does not care
about your vacation plans

  
It does not care about your bucket list

  
It does not care about your Netflix queue

  
It comes for everything

  
Then coronavirus

  
Awesome

  
How do I defeat coronavirus

  
A yearold middleaged
slightly overweight male with flat foot

  
It's easy to feel helpless

  
out of control adrift

  
But at the end of the day

  
try letting go of what you can't control

  
and just focus on what you can control

  
The simple stuff

  
Wear a mask

  
Get vaccinated

  
Take care of your daily chores

  
Something that makes you feel
that you have some control

  
some agency in this world

  
When it came to Nusayba

  
that meant as a dad
just to be present you know

  
building her her Lego Friends set
when she asked me to build it

  
Watching "Frozen"  times

  
then followed by "Zootopia"  times

  
then followed by "Moana"  times

  
Getting her the tasty frozen yogurt
from the hospital vending machine

  
that she loved

  
Do what you can the best you can

  
Have hope but tie your camel first

  
And then be like Elsa from "Frozen"

  
and let the rest go

  
Number two

  
invest in joy

  
Make the intention to actively invest
in this thing called joy every day

  
Almost like a workout

  
You have to commit to it

  
It has to be a discipline

  
Build and flex that muscle

  
The world does not need
more masochists or martyrs

  
It does not need more overworked
overstressed burnouts

  
New rule for 

  
You deserve to have moments of joy
even if they are fleeting

  
every day that you are alive

  
And you have to take those moments

  
you have to grab them
you have to seize them

  
I love food

  
so I learned how to cook Pakistani food

  
took my mom's recipes during lockdown

  
My kids love Lego
so that means now I love Lego

  
I love drinking chai

  
I make a cup of chai every day
it makes me happy

  
No matter how much stress or pain
or misery I was going through

  
I made sure to invest time every day

  
to invest in things and people

  
and experiences that gave me joy

  
And finally number three

  
I would recommend humbly
invest in the narrative of hope

  
because the alternative
is apathy and cynicism

  
Investing in hope is painful

  
It means opening yourself up
to the possibility of pain

  
betrayal and disappointment

  
It's easier to court cynicism right

  
You expect nothing so you lose nothing

  
But it also means you have resigned
yourself to the cheap seats

  
You are a spectator who yells out "Boo"

  
instead of being a participant in the ring
where your nose could get bloody

  
but at least you're pushing
the ball forward

  
It means choosing apathy and nihilism
which is comforting and easy

  
but also lazy and destructive

  
During Nusayba's cancer

  
I used to sit up every night
after my family went to sleep

  
and I stayed up till like
three or four am I couldn't sleep

  
And instead I imagined

  
like Doctor Strange
in "Avengers Endgame"

  
with the time stone

  
every possible scenario and outcome
just to prepare myself as a father

  
I had to emotionally prepare
for every outcome

  
So I used to imagine Nusayba dying

  
I imagined burying her with my own hands

  
I imagined making the phone call
to her grandparents

  
explaining that she had died
listening to them cry

  
I imagined living the rest of my life
like a shell of a man

  
but pretending to put a smile on my face

  
because I had a son to raise
and now a daughter

  
My wife badass that she is

  
was also pregnant
during Nusayba's cancer

  
I had to be prepared

  
But I also chose to invest in a narrative
in which Nusayba lived

  
And I imagined seeing her alive

  
with a liver transplant smiling

  
regaining her hair full of joy and life

  
I preferred that story

  
That's the story I invested in

  
even as we were sitting on the edge
of what seemed like a falling cliff

  
I decided I would put out the lawn chair
and at least enjoy the scenery

  
Over  people mostly strangers

  
chose to sign up
to be donors for Nusayba

  
even people who told me
they hated me for my politics

  
They were moved by her story

  
Sometimes some people can change

  
Sometimes some people
can choose to do and be good

  
An anonymous donor Shawn Zahir

  
decided to give a piece of his liver
to a girl he never met

  
just so she could live

  
I'm not Pollyanna

  
I'm not a foolish
wideeyed naive optimist

  
I'm a pragmatist

  
fully aware of the many challenges
and horrors we are facing

  
But through my own personal experience
if it is at all helpful

  
I can assure you that walking
through this forest of horrors

  
going on this journey
wherever it may lead

  
if you choose to invest in hope

  
it at least makes the ride
a bit sweeter and easier

  
And as the wise ram tells Po
in “Kung Fu Panda ”

  
"Your story may not have
such a happy beginning

  
but that does not make you who you are

  
It is the rest of it

  
who you choose to be"

  
Right now

  
survival is victory in this story
that we are living

  
We are alive during a pandemic

  
We are winning

  
And just for that we should be grateful

  
And I hope the choices we make
in these challenging times will

  
Inshallah God willing

  
lead to a better story for all of us

  
And I believe that begins
with choosing to invest in hope

  
during hopeless times

  
Whitney Pennigton Rogers
Thanks so much for that

  
It was really wonderful to hear

  
and I think we may even hear
Nusayba in the background

  
which is I think exciting

  
WA I'm sorry that's her
it's virtual school

  
I'm doing the best I can

  
The wildlings are right there

  
What's keeping us from the wildlings
is a very thin wall so let's pray

  
WPR I think we talked
about this before we started

  
that we're all at home right now

  
That's the thing I think we all know

  
So that's what it is

  
I think before we dive into just
talking more about what you've suggested

  
around growing hope

  
I'd love to start by talking
a little bit about your book

  
"Go Back to Where You Came From"

  
because I think that it
will provide a nice foundation

  
for sort of understanding
your thinking around this

  
and sort of how you've come
to really embrace this

  
So I guess maybe you could start first
by talking about the title of the book

  
You know it's part memoir
part historical analysis

  
part howto guide on being inclusive
and creating a place of belonging

  
How did you come up with the title

  
Why did you choose this
for the title of your book

  
WA So the title is “Go Back
to Where You Came From

  
And Other Helpful Recommendations
on How to Become American”

  
Very deliberate tongue in cheek
both ugly and funny right

  
Because I believe that's the lived
experience of life

  
But that's the lived experience
of many Americans

  
who are still trying to love a country
that doesn't love us back

  
And so how do you respond to that pain

  
And some people cry
as you can tell I laugh

  
And so this book is also an elegy

  
for the rest of us

  
who are still striving
to be coprotagonists

  
of this American narrative

  
And the book tries to expand
and stretch this country

  
to accommodate all of us

  
to become the multiracial
democracy it has to become

  
Or else I believe it'll all fail

  
And it's done with a lot
of humor and hope

  
and throughout the journey
you read the book

  
you know I talk about Nusayba's cancer

  
but there's lots of interesting
things that happen to me

  
WPR To put it mildly

  
WA Yeah my life is like a telenovela

  
like a Mexican soap opera
for better and for worse

  
And so I hope that when you get
to the end part

  
where I talk about "invest in hope
but tie your camel first"

  
the hope that I give
the audience for the future

  
I don't want it to make it a hallmarky

  
fake saccharine Hollywood ending

  
I want you to really like
I want it to be earned

  
And you know the way to earn it
is to confront the horrors

  
confront the challenges name it own it

  
Talk about the pain
wear the mileage and the scars

  
But despite all of that
you still persist right

  
And because I agree I mean

  
what I said in the speech
the fiveminute talk that I just gave you

  
I believe in it

  
I've been on all the sides
in moments of deep despair

  
I've been there of darkness of pain

  
and I realize if you tap out it's over

  
If you tap out it's done

  
And what I've seen

  
and we'll probably talk about it
because you read the book

  
in those moments in my life
where you feel like it's over it's done

  
I'm at the edge of the cliff
and I'm about to fall

  
there's been a plot twist

  
Like the the page turns

  
and with it comes like a better story

  
And so in the book
I mention there was a time

  
where I was completely broke homeless

  
my parents were in jail
I was taking care of my grandparents

  
And I’m like there’s no way
I couldn’t even imagine my future

  
I couldn't imagine
living to the age of 

  
I thought I would be dead by 

  
I’m being honest
with anyone who’s listening

  
My timeline you know I imagine a lot
like I said like Doctor Strange

  
it ended at 
I just couldn't imagine it

  
And I just knew that I would die

  
It’d be over and I almost did die

  
But here I am sitting in my home

  
married to a woman
who's way better than me

  
I married way up

  
Like hotter than me smarter than me

  
like it’s ridiculous not even cool

  
And then I got three kids
and then Nusayba who was supposed to die

  
that’s what they told me
she wouldn’t make it

  
They said every complication
against this girl is happening

  
you could just hear her
chirping right now

  
I'm sure you guys can hear her
chirping that's Nusayba

  
So you never know you never know

  
WPR We have a question
that came in from Darcy

  
where Darcy asked "The idea
of investing in hope is a great one

  
But how can we make it tangible

  
You mentioned visualization
or avoiding complaining

  
but how else can we actually
bring this to life"

  
WA It's a very good question

  
and that's where I say
tie your camel first

  
You have to exhaust yourself
of every possibility within your control

  
You know and after that
you have to let go

  
I'll give you an example
I mention it in the book

  
There was a moment
my parents were in jail

  
I'm  years old I have to leave school

  
I'm taking care of my grandparents

  
my grandmothers who used to live with me

  
I'm an only child

  
I have to care of the family business

  
I have to pay the lawyer

  
It's post/ my community
turns vicious and cruel

  
Bad news travels fast
ladies and gentlemen

  
bad news travels fast

  
I'm surgical with my budget

  
I have an Excel sheet

  
I've got to pay all the bills

  
According to my Excel sheet

  
after I withdrew the  dollars
from Wells Fargo

  
on the corner of Warm Springs and Mission

  
I was supposed to have  dollars left

  
I go to the ATM of Wells Fargo

  
I take out the  bucks
I get the receipt

  
I look at the bottom
instead of  dollars

  
it was 

  
I had  dollars 

  
I had to pay the bills pay the lawyer

  
take care of my family

  
And I swear to you at that time 

  
I mean honestly I said
“I have done everything in my power

  
I am exhausted

  
What can I do with three cents”

  
I didn't even get angry
I didn't get upset

  
I remember this vividly
it was a beautiful Bay Area day

  
anyone who lives there knows
pm little bit of a windy breeze

  
The sun was still there
it was just idyllic

  
And I remember I started laughing
look at the receipt

  
and a couple of people behind me

  
were trying to figure out
what’s wrong with this guy

  
Because I didn’t know what to do
I just chuckled I had three cents left

  
So this is what I did

  
I took the  dollars went across
the street and decided to splurge

  
I went to Subway

  
and had a Subway supersized meal

  
footlong tuna sandwich
with all the workings and avocado

  
And then I decided to have
two chocolate chip cookies

  
Then I went next door and had 
what is a Venti

  
What's the largest one at Starbucks

  
WPR I think Venti I don't drink coffee

  
WA Venti caramel frappe
with extra caramel drizzle right

  
And I had now  dollars
became  dollars

  
I went home and I told my grandmother

  
I said "I've done
everything I possibly could

  
There's nothing else I can do

  
We have  bucks left I'm sorry"

  
I had some Dal Chawal that night
watched a Netflix movie

  
And I remember I said this
in the book I let go

  
There's nothing else I could do

  
I completely let go

  
I said Allah whatever happens
Inshallah I leave it up to you

  
I've done everything within my powers

  
like everything I could possibly
think of I've done

  
This is it like
you want to save me save me

  
you don't want to save me whatever
I enjoyed my Subway meal

  
And I remember
this is really interesting

  
I had the best night's sleep that night
that I have ever had in my life

  
I remember that sleep to this day

  
I have prayed for that sleep

  
I felt like I was a baby
in my mother's womb

  
I tried to wonder why

  
It's because I knew that I did
everything within my powers

  
I exhausted myself and I let it go

  
And then what happened

  
somehow I got a loan
and  bucks came

  
And the story continued

  
And so when you're saying
about doing something tangible

  
it's not just me saying that like

  
you have to have some feeling
of control and autonomy

  
in what is a world where you feel adrift

  
and the ground is shifting
beneath your feet

  
Those small chores
that you take for granted

  
they'll give you order some discipline

  
I’m making that chai I’m painting this

  
I’m feeding my children
I took out the trash

  
I did some work today

  
I can control this
I did this with my hands

  
I'm still alive right

  
And then you plot
and you do the best you can

  
and then you let go

  
And I think those daily chores
that daily routine that you establish

  
gives you a sense of rhythm

  
at the very least says

  
"The world can take everything
but it won't take this

  
It won't take my delicious cup of chai
that I made with my own hands

  
It won't take this little plant
I plotted outside

  
It won't take my love for my kids

  
It won't take that from me

  
Not today death not today"

  
So I hope for whoever asked that question
I hope that was hopeful

The moon goddess Ix Chel patiently
watched a spider at work

  
She could make use of it skills 
she thought

  
Through careful observation and imitation
she soon became a skilled weaver

  
The sun god Kinich Ahau 
was impressed with her work

  
and admired her from afar

  
But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive

  
and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter

  
To get past the grandfather
the sun god disguised himself

  
as a hummingbird

  
As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey

  
the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather

  
to capture the bird for her

  
The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart stunning him

  
Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health

  
and soon he was able to spread his wings
and fly again

  
He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess

  
to escape with him

  
The two rowed away in a canoe

  
but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god

  
to help him stop them

  
Sensing danger the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below

  
and transformed into a crab

  
But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt

  
which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart killing her

  
Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered

  
buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings

  
They formed a thick magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body

  
For thirteen days the dragonflies cut 
cleaned and hollowed thirteen logs

  
On the thirteenth night 
the logs burst open

  
and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever

  
The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage

  
The moon goddess happily agreed

  
Sidebyside they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays

  
Unfortunately the story 
doesn’t end there

  
The sun god’s brother visited often

  
Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel 
the sun god grew jealous

  
and began to mistreat her

  
One day Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank

  
furious at her husband

  
A huge bird came gliding down

  
and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks

  
To get away from the cruel sun god
she agreed

  
There she met the king of the vultures

  
The vulture king was kind and funloving—

  
a much better partner
than the violent sun god

  
The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains

  
When the sun god heard he was distraught

  
He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down

  
then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom

  
where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king

  
He begged her to come home with him
apologizing for how he had treated her

  
The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back

  
But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again

  
He struck her scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays

  
Ix Chel flew off into the dark

  
From then on she vowed 
to appear only at night

  
She befriended the stars and combined
her pale blue rays with their light

  
to guide night travelers to safety

  
She used her healing gift

  
which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god

  
to cure people who were ill

  
Today Ix Chel is so widely known

  
that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture

  
But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya

  
Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities

  
In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists

  
the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends

  
beyond the limits 
of the historical record

  
Her story like all myths 
isn’t just one story

  
the variations ancient and modern
speak to what people value

  
and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes

  
So I come from Bosnia

  
I mean I live in Sweden now

  
but you don't need to know
my whole life story

  
But the story that I do want to share
is from my home country

  
So close to  percent
of the land in Bosnia

  
is dedicated to agriculture and farming

  
So the government
decides to support farmers

  
to set up a budget

  
to set up the requirements
for the people to receive the budget

  
and then to disburse the funds

  
So they do that and towards
the end of the process

  
they decide to analyze
who really received these funds

  
And they did that

  
and the Ministry
of Agriculture was shocked

  
because only one group of citizens
received  percent of these funds

  
And those were men
men working in agriculture

  
So where were the women

  
Why didn't they have access to the funds

  
The Minister of Agriculture was surprised
because they didn't mean to discriminate

  
They knew there were women
working in agriculture right

  
So they went back
and analyzed the situation

  
And the problem was 
well there were three things

  
The first thing is they didn't even know
the gender of farmers

  
because they'd never done
gender analysis before

  
So actually they did know
the sex disaggregation of cows

  
but not of people

  
(Laughter)

  
I will let that sink a bit 

  
because gender is unimportant

  
The second issue is that the way
they were distributing the funds

  
could not possibly reach women

  
Why Because one of the conditions
to get this subsidy

  
was to give out
a land ownership certificate

  
and we know that traditionally
women do not own land

  
And the second problem
was that women didn't even know

  
Why Because the information was shared
at forums that they do not participate in

  
But the story has a happy end
because when the ministry realized this

  
they changed these provisions

  
And with the help
of gender experts from Bosnia

  
we now see more and more women
getting funds every year

  
So what is the point of this story

  
The point is not only that we should have
sexdisaggregated data on people

  
not only cows

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's also that we can budget
fair and equitably

  
but we can't just run numbers blindly

  
We need to know the faces of the people
that we are serving with public funds

  
So this is really the heart
of genderresponsive budgeting

  
or as I like to think of it
and maybe you too

  
commonsense budgeting

  
(Laughter)

  
So I'm an economist

  
I work with public finance
so public finance and budgets

  
but my specialty is helping governments
inject a gender perspective

  
in their financial decisions and budgets

  
OK so budgets are fairly simple
straightforward

  
as it was introduced

  
and now you are thinking

  
"Well that does not look
fairly straightforward"

  
And it's intentionally done like that

  
because this is how we often imagine
the budget to be so complex

  
so technocratic bureaucratic
we don't even want to engage

  
But the reality
is very different than that

  
In fact all our budgets

  
be it your own budgets
or public budgets or company budgets

  
go through the four logical steps

  
The first step is of course
we are calculating our revenues

  
In the sense of the state
it would be taxes and fees right

  
The second step is budget approval

  
After we figure out
what we will do with the funds

  
it goes to the approval of the parliament

  
And then the third step
my personal favorite

  
is spending or budget execution

  
Ideally according to priorities 
not my personal favorite

  
And then we go into control
and budget oversight

  
So whether we have actually spent
the money as we planned

  
and also whether we have
achieved the objectives

  
So in the sense of the state

  
it would be an increased
level of education

  
decreased level of poverty

  
In the sense of the companies
it would be profit or income

  
You see where I'm going

  
So what is really wrong with that

  
It sounds perfectly logical

  
Well what is wrong with that

  
is that traditionally in most countries
if not all around the world

  
we assume when we are planning
the budget funds

  
that we are targeting one universal
homogenous human

  
that will have the same access to funds
the same needs almost

  
And then a situation such as this one
in the Ministry of Agriculture happens;

  
then we are surprised that our funds
didn't really reach everybody

  
So what I want to also say here
what do we then do about that

  
In Ukraine the government has analyzed
close to  budget programs

  
And when I say “budget programs”

  
these are expenditures
in health education sports

  
infrastructure defense 

  
anything you can think of
that is funded with public funds

  
And in every single one of these programs
we have found gender gaps

  
We have found big gender gaps

  
And these gender gaps
were usually on account of women 

  
they didn't have access

  
And why did this happen

  
It happened because finance officers
were just doing their jobs

  
and they were doing it really well

  
They were planning for economic
effectiveness efficiency

  
value for money 

  
We really love value for money

  
Performance budgeting mediumterm 

  
all of these very valid
economic objectives

  
very valid goals

  
but we really didn't account
for the needs of the people

  
that we are serving with these funds

  
And let me illustrate that

  
So we have analyzed
the program for tuberculosis

  
So treatment of patients
with tuberculosis

  
And you may be now asking

  
"OK but you know
you need to treat the patient

  
Why is gender important here"

  
But when we have done the analysis

  
we have actually seen that  percent

  
of the patients
with tuberculosis were men

  
And tuberculosis
is a big issue in Ukraine

  
And these were men living in remote areas
in rural areas working in mines

  
However the preventive measures
and the way they were designed

  
they didn't account for it

  
They were actually targeting
those sectors

  
such as education and health

  
where women traditionally dominate

  
And this is fine

  
but they really didn’t account
for the needs of the men in these groups

  
And why

  
Because gender equality was not important
in the budget decision

  
So what I'm trying to illustrate here

  
is not only that we need
to account for gender equality

  
to achieve our objectives of equality

  
but we also need to account for it to make
more commonsense budgetary decisions

  
more effective and efficient budgets

  
So how do we do that

  
It looks equally entertaining

  
but now we also add gender

  
so it's a total mess and we would think
"How do we even go about that"

  
But of course
it's not as complex as that

  
because in the heart of this work
is gender analysis

  
And what do I mean by that

  
So when we are planning
as finance officers

  
any financial or fiscal decision

  
meaning when we are planning
introducing a new tax for example

  
the core is to analyze
how will that influence

  
different groups in a society

  
So will we have
our gender gaps increased 

  
we don’t want to do that 

  
reduced or leave the status quo

  
So of course we want to reduce them

  
and I just want to put it here as well

  
in most countries 
not all unfortunately

  
but in a lot of countries
around the world

  
we have a very solid legislative framework
for gender equality

  
We have commitments

  
But when it comes to budget and finance

  
that's where suddenly
the story evaporates

  
So when it comes to money

  
it's not really analyzed
for gender impact

  
So this is really important

  
and we do this in as I said three steps

  
I will take you very fast
through these steps don't worry

  
So the first step is really
to do a situation analysis

  
So in our agriculture example

  
if we had done a situation analysis

  
and if we had known
the gender gaps in this sector

  
we wouldn't have been surprised

  
We would have known
that women do not own land

  
so we wouldn't give this as a requirement

  
and we would definitely have known
that we need to inform them

  
in a different way

  
So this is the first step

  
The second step is related to my example
with sex disaggregation

  
you will remember from the beginning

  
So we really need to know
the beneficiaries

  
that we are trying to serve

  
And now you are thinking
"This sounds very obvious"

  
but it's not done

  
And the third step of course
is to know the procedures

  
How will we give this budget out
who will have access

  
What will be the excluded groups

  
And that's it

  
And now I will just share
some good news I think

  
It's that around  countries
around the world

  
are working with gender budgeting

  
And please if you have an interest

  
just see if your own country
is one of them

  
But when I say they are working
with gender budgeting

  
that does not mean that their whole budget
is genderresponsive

  
That would be my dream

  
But my personal hero is Austria Why

  
Because they have gender budgeting
entrenched in the constitution

  
So that means that in Austria

  
it cannot happen that you have
an investment project

  
that you are doing
without considering gender

  
and gender equality

  
Canada  feminist government
genderbalanced cabinet 

  
and they are doing gender budgeting

  
but they are taking into account
the needs of Indigenous groups of people

  
So this is also something
that we want to do

  
and we have to do

  
Let me take you to Morocco

  
Morocco is working with gender
budgeting for  years

  
Indonesia with the help
of the World Bank

  
has just analyzed
their whole budget system

  
to make it more genderresponsive

  
And I need to take you again to Bosnia

  
because I did start with that example

  
Balkan countries are doing fantastic work
with the help of UN Women

  
So there is a lot of work happening

  
and I am now coming to an end

  
because you might now be wondering

  
"OK but what is in it
for me" in a sense

  
"You are talking about public budgets

  
but I work in a company or NGO
or I'm selfemployed" doesn't matter

  
So what is it Why is it important for us

  
Because this is our money

  
These are our budgets

  
We are filling these budgets 

  
it's not some abstract money out there

  
so we have the right to demand it
to be equitable to be fair

  
That's one thing

  
So it is important for countries
it's important for companies

  
Of course we should ask
who is making decisions

  
whose needs are being satisfied

  
And also maybe families

  
But who really has the voice
who is making decisions

  
It's interesting just to see
and then to maybe be surprised

  
that these ministries are not

  
So if you are interested
you are literally one click away 

  
and I'm aware this sounds
like a sales pitch

  
but I am selling you the work of many
many genderbudgeting experts

  
around the world

  
who have been for years
working with these concepts

  
So you have such a wealth of material

  
from UN Women IMF different scholars

  
World Bank Swedish government 

  
doesn’t matter I will not go
into all the wealth of materials

  
So it's all out there

  
And if we do that
we will have the budgets

  
that will not only lead
to gender equality

  
which is an amazing objective in itself

  
but we will have better more effective
more efficient more fair budgets

  
What's not to like

  
So I hope next time we meet
maybe here again

  
this type of genderresponsive budgeting
will be called "budgeting"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
So when I was born on September  

  
my grandparents and great
grandparents back in India

  
didn't find out for two weeks

  
which is a shame because I mean
look how perfect I was

  
(Laughter)

  
And it's not because the phone
lines were down

  
or because they weren't available

  
It's because there was
a complication with my birth

  
And that complication
was being assigned female at birth

  
You see because my mom had been told
that if she gave birth to a daughter

  
it wasn't worth phoning home about

  
After all she’d already given birth
to my older sister

  
and this time everyone had high hopes
that she would do right and have a son

  
But she didn't

  
She had me

  
And so there were no congratulations
or Indian sweets sent our way

  
Just the reality that from the moment
I came into this world

  
I was already a disappointment
to so many people

  
It's as if they had a time machine

  
and already knew the trajectory
of my entire career and life

  
and decided that I had less to offer

  
And it sucked

  
So why am I telling you this heavy story

  
I'm supposed to be a funny person

  
I have the nerve to come out here
and hit you right in the feels

  
How dare I

  
I'm telling you this because although
this is my lived experience

  
it's also the reality
that millions of girls face every day

  
across every culture and in every country

  
And I'm telling you this
because being born into this reality

  
set me on a lifetime mission
of trying to prove myself

  
and just feel like I was enough

  
What did I want to be when I grow up

  
I wanted to be treated equally

  
And I'm not alone in this mission

  
In fact us girls
what we desperately want

  
is a seat at the table

  
It's what every motivational poster
Tumblr post Instagram account you follow

  
business card tells us

  
Success is a seat at the table

  
And if they want to be extra spicy

  
they say "If there is no seat
drag your own seat"

  
I'm sure you've heard this right

  
And so my marching orders were clear

  
Get a seat at this coveted table
by any means necessary

  
And that's been the driving force
behind my entire career

  
Now in 

  
I noticed that no one
on YouTube looked like me

  
There was no South Asian woman
who's very loud and uses her hands a lot

  
giving her take on the world

  
There was no me in front of a camera

  
I saw a seat up for grabs

  
So I got to work and I started a channel
under the name “Superwoman”

  
Yeah because although
I’m smart enough to do a TED Talk

  
I'm not smart enough
to understand copyright

  
(Laughter)

  
I taught myself how to write

  
shoot and edit my own content

  
And I worked really hard

  
When I finally got the hang of it

  
I committed to posting
two comedy videos a week

  
And I found success

  
With a backwards snapback on my head

  
I gave my take on relationships
pop culture taboo subjects

  
and most popularly
dressed up like my parents

  
(Laughter)

  
I can't tell you how many times
I forgot to wipe that chest hair off

  
A lot of times

  
(Laughter)

  
Now fast forward to 

  
and I'm on stage in India
announcing my first world tour

  
As fate would have it

  
the day after this monumental milestone

  
I was set to fly to Punjab India

  
to visit my grandfather
for the first time in my adult life

  
And whoo nothing could have prepared me

  
for what was about to happen

  
I vividly remember it

  
I was in the car driving to his house

  
He was standing outside

  
I nervously got out of the car
walked up to him

  
He walked up to me
looked me right in the eyes

  
and he raised his hand

  
and decorated me with a flower garland

  
a gesture fit for people of importance

  
He then proceeded to welcome me
into his home my mom by my side

  
and proceed to show me
all the newspaper clippings he had saved

  
with my name and face on them

  
He said the words he was wrong

  
Words I had never heard
a man say before to me

  
He said that I had done
what no one else could have done

  
and I had made the family name proud

  
Me Lilly the baby born a girl

  
That's right

  
Now in that moment
I truly felt like Superwoman

  
I did

  
You know through my YouTube videos

  
I've amassed almost  million subscribers
and three billion views

  
But more important than all of that

  
I managed to change one view

  
I challenged my grandfather's
entrenched gender beliefs

  
And for the first time in my life
I remember thinking in that moment

  
“Oh I finally got
a seat at the table ”

  
Hello props

  
(Laughter)

  
"  alongside the men in the industry”

  
I felt like that

  
And encouraged
by my grandfather's approval

  
I became more confident in my influence

  
I remember thinking "Oh I'm going
to talk at this table

  
I'm going to join
the dinner conversation"

  
You know a lot of my male mentors
make comments and posts

  
about box office numbers
and salaries and titles

  
and those dollar dollar bills

  
So I thought

  
I'm going to chime in here

  
I learned very quickly
that whenever I spoke of money

  
people got a little uncomfortable

  
Like the time I pointed out the gender gap

  
in the Forbes list for online creators

  
a list I'd previously been on

  
I remember wanting to start
a critical conversation

  
because I saw this article
and I was heartbroken

  
You know the digital space
had always been a place

  
that I thought was without gatekeepers

  
And here it was looking
just like old Hollywood

  
Well let me tell you
the internet was not interested

  
I don't know how it's possible

  
but it literally felt as if Twitter
leaped through my screen

  
and body slammed me onto my desk

  
The message was clear

  
you can be on this list

  
but don't try to start any conversations
about the inequality on this list

  
I have thousands and thousands of videos

  
One of my most disliked videos
is why I’m not in a relationship

  
Yeah

  
A lot of the men at the table
did not like me telling them

  
why I didn't need a boyfriend

  
I quickly learned

  
that there’s an invisible
gatekeeper called culture

  
and the table is smack dab
in the middle of it

  
Now in 

  
I made history with my latenight show

  
“A Little Late with Lilly Singh”

  
Thank you thank you

  
(Applause)

  
There I was Lilly
the baby born a brown girl

  
rubbing elbows or at least time slots

  
with comedy royalty

  
And I got to give a huge shout out to NBC

  
for boldly trying to break
latenight tradition

  
I remember when the show came out

  
I remember all the articles
because they looked practically identical

  
"Bisexual Woman of Color
Gets LateNight Show"

  
I almost legally changed my name
to "bisexual woman of color"

  
because that's what people
called me so often

  
And you know as strange
as that sentiment was I thought OK

  
the silver lining is that we'll finally
get a different perspective in latenight

  
A little bit of melanin a dash of queer

  
a different take on things

  
Let's do this!

  
And I remember thinking

  
"Now oh now I've been invited
to the big table

  
And now things will be different"

  
So I took my seat

  
Now unfortunately

  
the budget wasn't based
on the importance or significance

  
or historic nature of the show

  
It was based on the am
timeslot that we had

  
So to say the budget was small

  
the writing staff even smaller

  
and to do the first season

  
I had to shoot  episodes
of latenight television in three months

  
Audience Whoo

  
LS Whoo is right

  
To put that into perspective

  
that is shooting two
to three episodes a day

  
versus the network standard of one a day

  
maybe two on Thursday

  
We did it all with a writing staff
of about half a dozen writers

  
versus the network standard
that's about double that

  
Words cannot explain
to you how exhausting

  
emotionally and spiritually
challenging that was

  
And I started to feel like

  
"Hm I think this chair's
a little wobbly"

  
Now I think we can all agree

  
that the beauty and magic
of latenight is its timeliness

  
You know that no matter
what's happening in the world

  
you can turn on latenight television
and hear all about it

  
But when you shoot  episodes
in three months

  
you kind of lose that magic

  
I was the only show talking about
hooking up partying cuddling traveling

  
in front of a live audience
during a literal global pandemic

  
Now still I thought

  
if the budget doesn't celebrate
the historicness of the show

  
then the creative can

  
I can bring some much needed
spice to latenight

  
And sometimes I was successful

  
But other times

  
I would receive notes like

  
"Don't be so loud"

  
"Don't be so big"

  
"Don't be so angry smile more"

  
And my all time favorite

  
"Don't overindex
on the South Asian stuff"

  
After all everyone else at the table
who's been sitting there for years

  
people are used to them

  
I might be a little jarring to audiences

  
Now during season two of my show

  
I remember I went into overdrive

  
I found all the loopholes
I did all the necessary jobs

  
to try to make the show more timely

  
And I was excited to

  
And I felt compelled to
because for the first time in history

  
we had a woman not to mention
half South Asian woman

  
become vice president
of the United States

  
Now we witnessed one of the greatest
protests in human history

  
with the farmer protests in India

  
And I was excited to finally give
my take on these things

  
But my take was almost never included

  
in topical media news coverage roundups

  
You know we still got the same voices

  
the same perspectives

  
even though someone
and something different

  
was literally in the next time slot

  
I kept trying to pull up my seat

  
I kept trying to join
the dinner conversation

  
I kept trying to ask
for a more supportive seat

  
But every time I would be told

  
that I should be grateful
to have a seat in the first place

  
After all everyone else
that looks like me

  
is still waiting outside
the restaurant in the cold

  
You know the strange thing
about having a wobbly seat

  
is that you spend so much time
trying to keep it upright

  
that you can never bring
your full self to the table

  
So now why am I telling you all this

  
Well because my therapist
costs  dollars an hour

  
and this is way cheaper

  
(Laughter)

  
But also because I just experienced

  
one of the most notorious boys' clubs ever
in latenight television

  
And I'm here to offer solutions

  
I don't always follow up
a venting session with solutions

  
but when I do it’s a TED Talk

  
(Laughter)

  
That's right

  
(Applause)

  
You see my goal was always
a seat at the table

  
It's what women are conditioned
to believe success is

  
And when the chair doesn't fit

  
when it doesn't reach the table
when it's wobbly

  
when it's full of splinters

  
we don't have the luxury
of fixing it or finding another one

  
But we try anyways

  
We take on that responsibility
and we shoulder that burden

  
Now I've been fortunate enough
to sit at a few seats

  
at a few different tables

  
And what I've learned is
when you get the seat

  
trying to fix the seat
won't fix the problem

  
Why

  
Because the table was never built
for us in the first place

  
The solution

  
Build better tables

  
(Applause)

  
So allow me to be
your very own IKEA manual

  
I would like to present to you
a set of guidelines

  
I very eloquently call

  
“How to Build a Table that Doesn’t Suck”

  
(Laughter)

  
I've been told I'm very literal

  
Now right off the bat let me tell you

  
this assembly is going to take
more than one person

  
or group of people

  
It's going to take everyone

  
Are you ready Should we dive in

  
Let's do it

  
Up first

  
don't weaponize gratitude

  
Now don't get me wrong
gratitude is a great word

  
It's nice it's fluffy
a solid  points in Scrabble

  
However let's be clear

  
Although gratitude feels warm and fuzzy

  
it's not a form of currency

  
Women are assigned  percent more work

  
and spend more time on unrewarded

  
unrecognized and nonpromotable tasks

  
Basically what this means is

  
all the things men don't want to do
are being handed to women

  
and a lot of those things largely include
things that advance inclusivity

  
equity and diversity in the workplace

  
So hear me when I say

  
a woman shouldn't be grateful
to sit at a table

  
She should be paid to sit at a table

  
(Applause)

  
Especially ones she largely helped build

  
And a woman's seat shouldn't be threatened
if she doesn't seem "grateful" enough

  
In other words corporations

  
this step involves a woman doing a job

  
and being paid in money
opportunity and promotion

  
not just gratitude

  
And women  yeah go ahead
live it up live your life

  
(Applause)

  
And women a moment of real talk

  
trust me I've been there
and I know it's so tough

  
but we have to understand
and remember that being grateful

  
and being treated fairly
are not mutually exclusive

  
I can be grateful but still know
exactly what I deserve

  
And that's the way to do it

  
(Applause)

  
Up next invest in potential

  
When investing in women

  
don’t invest in the am time slot

  
Invest in empowering something different

  
Invest in a new voice

  
Give them the support they actually need

  
Cultural change takes time and money

  
Heck it took my grandfather  years
to see that I was worthy of more

  
So a true investment is one
that values potential over proof

  
Because so often that proof
doesn't exist for women

  
Not because we aren't qualified

  
but because we haven't been
given the opportunity

  
In other words

  
if you're trying to be inclusive

  
don't give someone new
a seat made of straw

  
until they prove
they deserve a better one

  
Don't hold something
called a "prove it again" bias

  
which requires less privileged people
to constantly keep proving themselves

  
even though white men tend to get by
on just their potential

  
Give them a seat that they can thrive in

  
that they can do the job
you hired them to do in

  
Allow them to contribute to the table

  
and they will make it better

  
Up next this is my favorite one

  
My favorite one it's quite
common sense actually

  
Make space for us

  
You know for every three men at a table

  
there's only one
place setting for a woman

  
People are so used to more men
showing up that they plan for it

  
There's an extra seat in the corner
there's a steak under the heat lamp

  
When more men show up
the table gets longer

  
But when that extra RSVP is a woman

  
more often than not

  
she's encouraged to compete
against the only other woman

  
that was invited to the table

  
Instead we need to build
multiple seats for multiple women

  
not just one or two

  
so that women are not sitting
on top of each other's laps

  
fighting for one meal

  
We already know that more
diverse teams perform better

  
A recent study shows

  
that corporations that have
more gender diversity

  
on their executive teams

  
were  percent more likely
to experience above average profitability

  
And more racially diverse companies
had  percent more profit

  
So really no matter how you look at it

  
it's time to build
longer tables and more seats

  
And I want to say something

  
and I want to admit something
I want to be vulnerable for a second

  
Because I've fallen victim
to this so many times

  
and women let me know
if you've experienced this

  
We have to get rid of the scarcity mindset
and champion each other

  
you know because I've learned
what's the better win

  
Me sitting at a table

  
or us sitting at a table

  
Don't be convinced to fight for one spot

  
Instead fight for multiple spots

  
(Applause)

  
And let me lead by example
right now and say

  
I know there’s many other women
that are going to come on this stage

  
and I hope they all nail it
and I will be cheering you all on

  
because we can all win

  
And I'm going to be your biggest
cheerleader when you're up here

  
(Applause)

  
Last it's time to upgrade the table talk

  
Now I believe stories
make the world go around

  
You thought it had something
to do the solar system

  
Joke's on you it's stories

  
(Laughs)

  
Stories are how we understand ourselves

  
how we understand others
and how we understand the world

  
And arguably the most important stories
are those we see in the media

  
Because we’ve seen time and time
that they control the narrative

  
and impact culture

  
Now when it comes to genre

  
you can argue that certain genres
have certain target demographics

  
When it comes to the world news
the target demographic is the world

  
and we know half of the world is female

  
Yet women and girls make up only
a quarter of the people interviewed

  
or that the news is even about
in the first place

  
Instead when it comes to issues
that impact women

  
we not only need to be included
in the coverage

  
we need to be driving those stories
and dimensionalizing our own experience

  
Inviting everyone in on the table talk
isn't just a nice gesture

  
It makes for better more productive
smarter conversation

  
with more than one point of view

  
And that's how you get better

  
So this all sounds like a lot of work

  
And it is

  
But I'm going to tell you
why it's necessary and worth it

  
To be honest this is about so much more
than just women in the workplace

  
In fact I could probably come up
with many more guidelines

  
across many other industries

  
This is about creating a world
where half of the population can thrive

  
You see because the work we do today

  
can create a world
where future generations of girls

  
can have equitable access and opportunity

  
And here's the best part
Are you ready for it

  
Everyone listening today
all the men the women

  
everyone in between the big companies
the small ones the media outlets

  
the people that snuck
into the back all of you

  
you can help create this future

  
A future where we have longer tables

  
and more seats that actually work

  
instead of fighting for a seat
at the old ones that don't

  
A future where everyone
is seated at the table equally

  
And a future

  
where being assigned female at birth
is not a disappointment

  
or a disadvantage

  
because girls are encouraged

  
empowered and expected to do great things

  
And I can't wait to make that a reality

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Growing up in a workingclass town
in upstate New York

  
I was taught to hope for a future
with a husband and two kids

  
How about you

  
I saw women in my community
marry as a path to economic security

  
but often end up with discontent
and even abuse instead

  
As I got older

  
I came to wonder and I ask you now

  
What is family

  
What do we want family to be

  
The nuclear family has been the basis
for our cultural stories and our laws

  
But only about half
of US adults are married

  
Fewer every year

  
Forty percent of US adults
don't live with a romantic partner at all

  
As of 

  
less than half of US children
had two married heterosexual parents

  
in their first marriage

  
The majority of us are not in a nuclear
family with a spouse and kids

  
Yet somehow

  
we treat this majority of people
like social failures

  
What’s worse

  
our laws treat unmarried people
as lesser citizens

  
Marriage comes with over  rights
and benefits under federal law

  
These include the ability
to get your spouse citizenship

  
share health insurance
get better tax rates

  
and inherit taxfree at death and more

  
Part of the winning argument
for samesex marriage

  
was that we shouldn't deprive gay couples
of all of these essential benefits

  
But I ask you

  
why should anyone be denied benefits
because they're in a romantic relationship

  
of which some people disapprove

  
Or because they're single

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
Or because they're basing family

  
on something other
than a romantic relationship

  
like coparenting a child

  
Our laws should move away from the idea
that there's one ideal family form

  
and value all families as they exist

  
(Applause)

  
That's what I've dedicated my career to

  
and today I'll share some of my visions

  
for how we can change US laws
to benefit all families

  
but also how an expansive view of family

  
will strengthen all
of your own relationships

  
For nearly  years with my law firm
for LGBTQ and nonnuclear families

  
I've supported same sex couples

  
But also the many family
forms beyond marriage

  
like platonic partners
who are raising a child together

  
or sharing finances
without a romantic relationship

  
Or grandparents who are raising
their grandchildren

  
Or a lesbian couple
coparenting with a male friend

  
Or polyamorous partners

  
who might be in a committed
relationship of three or four

  
Within that legal advocacy

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
and then help them design
their own family agreements

  
With the nonprofit
organization I founded

  
Chosen Family Law Center

  
I advocate for changes in US laws

  
to benefit this whole beautiful spectrum
of family constellations

  
And it is my core belief
that no matter how you form family

  
actively discussing
how we intend to live together

  
is the best thing we can do to strengthen
our own personal relationships

  
So how did we end up with this current
US emphasis on nuclear family

  
Most of us throughout history have lived
in large extended family networks

  
and  percent of the world
population does today

  
The nuclear family is actually
a relatively new development

  
It emerged in the industrial revolution

  
to support a working dad
and a homemaker mom

  
It peaked in the s and 's

  
but it hasn't been the most common
family form before or since

  
Still somehow it's the basis
for our health insurance system

  
How well is that working out

  
And a reason for our lack
of affordable childcare in this country

  
We still build and zone suburban homes
with this fictional family in mind

  
In Western Europe where I live
and in many other countries

  
states provide support
for citizens in need

  
including parents who are home
with young children

  
such as paid maternity leave

  
and financial support throughout
the childhood if needed

  
But in US law

  
we make sure that financial safety net
happens between spouses

  
rather than between citizen and state

  
US marriage is a social
welfare state of two

  
I'd rather a different social
welfare state personally

  
This leaves many people especially women

  
stuck in unhealthy relationships

  
So at this point

  
we can evaluate how samesex partnership

  
when we move into that movement
for same sex marriage

  
there was really an emphasis

  
on whether we should be
pushing for gay marriage

  
so that gay people could get
the benefits of marriage

  
or whether we should be working
to protect the rights of the unmarried

  
And we can do both

  
It's time now to protect
the rights of unmarried people

  
and other kinds of family constellations

  
(Applause)

  
Because the reality is
there's no evidence

  
that the nuclear family model
is actually the best one

  
Research has consistently shown

  
that children need stability
of parental figures

  
But from what I've consistently found

  
it doesn't matter
if that stability is mom and dad

  
two dads mom and grandma

  
or three polyamorous partners

  
So this is not only about justice

  
This is about what's best for children

  
If we really want that stability for kids

  
we need to provide support for all
the kinds of families that kids are in

  
rather than try and fail

  
to push people into a nuclear family model
with government benefits

  
It's time to observe
what's not working and change course

  
My definition of family

  
is people who are committed
to be there for each other

  
no matter what

  
This includes chosen family

  
regardless of biological relationship
or legal marriage

  
Many Black families in the US
have chosen aunties and uncles

  
with no blood relation

  
but a decision to be family
and a commitment to the children involved

  
Countless LGBTQ people
create chosen family

  
when they're rejected
by their family of origin

  
or when wanting to create
families that share their values

  
I am one of those queer people
to find home with chosen family

  
I grew up in a Christian family
in a small town

  
the only child of wonderful older parents

  
When I came out as bisexual

  
then as polyamorous
then as gender nonbinary

  
most of my blood relations
and over  cousins stopped talking to me

  
That's pretty standard

  
When I was a broke something
starting my law practice

  
I was diagnosed with cervical cancer

  
And realized that I'd been duped
into buying a health insurance

  
that didn't cover cancer

  
I was in a desperate
lifethreatening situation

  
And while my parents were loving

  
they couldn't provide me
with material support or problemsolving

  
So I broke through my shame
and my embarrassment

  
about asking for help

  
And I reached out
to my communities of friends

  
And I discovered that they were eager
to more actively support one another

  
They made a schedule

  
so there was always
someone there to cook to clean

  
to make phone calls
about my health coverage

  
or just sit with me while I cried
in my grief and my fear

  
When I won my appeal to receive coverage
by the Cancer Services Medicaid program

  
the administrator called and said

  
"I don't know who you are
but a lot of people love you"

  
(Applause)

  
And then she said "And I'd like them
to stop calling my office now please

  
Let them know you got coverage it's done

  
Thank you"

  
(Laughter)

  
The chosen family who stepped up for me

  
probably saved my life

  
But they wouldn't necessarily be able
to visit me in the hospital

  
or cross a border
in a pandemic to be with me

  
Because relationships beyond blood
and beyond marriage

  
often don't get those rights

  
And since then my life's work
has been to change that and I will

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
When we embrace the idea of chosen family

  
our own free will is more important
than biological connection

  
We can choose to create
family relationships

  
with the people who provide us
with the meaningful support

  
that we need and deserve

  
Samesex parenting has also advanced
the concept of family beyond biology

  
because in a same sex couple

  
only one parent's providing
the sperm or the egg

  
In my familybuilding legal work
with these families

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
before designing that legal agreement

  
For example

  
I’ll often work with a female
samesex couple

  
who has a male friend
who wants to "help" them become parents

  
So I'll facilitate discussions
to make sure they're all clear

  
on whether he's going to be
a coparent or a sperm donor

  
and design a legal agreement either way

  
Without that I've seen
too many situations of ambiguity

  
Where mom calls him a dad
when she needs childcare help

  
but a donor when it comes time
to make a big decision

  
she doesn't want his input on

  
He calls himself dad
when the baby's adorable at the park

  
but feels more like a donor
when the school bill comes you know

  
When we're designing our own families

  
we need clear written agreements

  
especially if children are involved

  
Let's say I have two clients
Sharon and Bill

  
best friends who are considering
becoming coparents

  
Sharon's turned 

  
and hasn't found the right man
with whom to marry and have kids

  
Neither has her gay bestie Bill

  
who can’t afford the $
surrogacy process by himself

  
So they call each other their Plan B

  
I would facilitate discussions with them
about their parenting values

  
their plans to share
finances for the child

  
their ideal week of childcare split

  
But the conversation
often gets more difficult

  
when I ask questions like

  
"Are you willing to live in the same city
for the next  years

  
to each be near the child"

  
We're used to the idea
of sacrificing for a spouse

  
and saying "no" to a dream job
in a different city

  
to stay close to each other

  
But it's a shocking idea
to do that for your buddy

  
But by becoming coparenting partners

  
they need to elevate their level
of commitment from friends

  
to platonic partners

  
They need to consciously say “goodbye”
to a Prince Charming fantasy

  
and welcome and embrace a new reality

  
of a beautiful partnership
grounded in their longterm friendship

  
and agree that this coparenting
relationship will come first

  
I have found in my work

  
that these kinds of discussions
are much more powerful

  
for preventing future disputes
than any written contract can be

  
We need to have these conversations

  
Legal contracts are sometimes written
to avoid looking eye to eye

  
and coming to agreement

  
But family contracts should only
be written after you've done that

  
When I design relationships

  
for polyamorous triads of three
or quads of four

  
I sometimes use existing legal structures

  
like trusts or LLCs

  
that allow you to share
property and finances

  
without a question
as to your relationship

  
So for example if I've got
a polyamorous triad

  
Ayesha Susan and Linda

  
I can set up an LLC for them

  
so that they can coown
real estate properties

  
pay taxes together

  
purchase a common health insurance

  
and have clear
exit strategies if they wish

  
(Applause)

  
And if people trust each other enough

  
to pool their financial fortune
and want to pay taxes together

  
it shouldn't matter
whether they're business partners

  
siblings or romantic partners

  
All of those families are valid

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
We should be able to choose legal partners

  
beyond a single romantic
partner like a spouse

  
Some people are doing that now

  
and it's the trend for the future

  
Domestic partnerships have been used
for  years by samesex couples

  
but also by best friends and siblings

  
Doing so as domestic partners
allows you to share your health insurance

  
to visit each other in the hospital

  
and across borders
in a pandemic like spouses

  
But unlike spouses you don't become
a social welfare state of two

  
which can be a good thing

  
I had a client who had
a severely disabled sister

  
By becoming domestic partners

  
she was able to put her sister

  
on her excellent
health insurance coverage

  
Why would a sister be any less worthy
of that than a boyfriend

  
Right

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
We've built on that history

  
In  my organization
helped pass the first laws

  
for multipartner domestic partnership

  
which have passed
in several cities and counting

  
This means that three
or four polyamorous partners

  
could become domestic partners

  
or two or more platonic coparents

  
or any two three or four people

  
who want to become
each other's legal partners

  
When relationships
have legal status like this

  
it reduces discrimination and promotes
social acceptance and awareness

  
as we saw in the samesex
partnership movement

  
Still we hope this year to pass

  
the first family status
nondiscrimination laws

  
at city levels across the United States

  
which means that you
can't be discriminated against

  
you can't be fired from your job
or denied housing

  
because of your family configuration

  
(Applause)

  
In future

  
I propose that we move from these
citylevel domestic partnerships

  
to statelevel multipartner
domestic partnerships

  
and then federal recognition

  
as we did with samesex marriage

  
And if we really want
to value families as they exist

  
rather than incentivize marriage

  
I also suggest that we separate out
some of the legal perks of marriage

  
so that single people and other kinds
of families get these benefits

  
without an evaluation of whether
they're in a romantic relationship

  
that passes muster

  
And marriage should not be the gateway
to social and economic privilege anymore

  
That time is done

  
And marriages will be stronger
when we do that

  
Do you know anyone who got married
faster than they should have

  
for health insurance or citizenship

  
Because I know too many
and I’m a divorce lawyer

  
(Laughter)

  
As a divorce lawyer
relationships last longer

  
when we marry for better reasons
than government perks

  
So many of you may be married

  
and may not think that these issues
have personal relevance for you

  
But I ask you to reflect

  
Could your relationship be stronger

  
if you adopted a more
expansive view of family

  
Marriage and partnership
are not onesizefitsall

  
Every couple in partnership benefits

  
from actively deciding how they want
to cocreate together

  
in terms of coparenting shared finances

  
your household

  
and your definition of monogamy

  
For example

  
is there any hidden expectation
that you have with your partner

  
that would benefit from being
spoken out loud and confirmed

  
I bet there is

  
Or is there any aspect of partnership
that you participate in

  
just because everyone does it

  
like sleeping in the same bed
or only vacationing together

  
that just isn't really working
for your partnership

  
When we expect any one relationship
in our lives to meet most of our needs

  
we may be putting too much pressure
on that relationship

  
And whether it's your romantic partner
your parent your adult child

  
your relationship may be stronger

  
if you also strengthen
other connections in your lives

  
and find other ways to get
some of your own needs met

  
(Applause)

  
My husband does not want
to help me process

  
I have other people for that in my life

  
So 

  
I think it's worthwhile to question

  
no matter what kind of family
configuration you're in

  
whether you could be part of a movement
for greater interconnectedness

  
beyond our romantic relationships
and beyond the walls of our home

  
Your family and your community
will be stronger when you do

  
Is there a longterm friend
that you could reach out to

  
with whom you'd like to be better in touch

  
and suggest a regular date
for a special time together

  
Could you create a childcare cooperative
with other parents in your community

  
Is there a single parent
or elderly person in your life

  
whose home you could spend more time in

  
At some point in a long life

  
you too will need support

  
And it benefits you
to practice asking for support now

  
and actively caring
for people in community

  
who may one day care for you

  
A baby whose diaper you change
may one day change yours

  
(Audience murmurs and laughs)

  
Sorry

  
It's the beautiful reciprocity
of human relationship

  
And in my vision for the future

  
while we work together
to redefine family in law

  
we can all redefine family
in our own culture and lives

  
There may even be a close friend
to whom you get the courage to ask

  
Do you want to make family with me

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
In the s American industrialist 
Henry Ford had one overwhelming obsession

  
soybeans

  
He extracted their oil to make enamel 
for painting his cars

  
He crushed them into powder
to make plastic parts

  
And he encouraged American farmers 
to grow as much of the plant as possible

  
But he wasn’t just feeding soy 
to machines

  
At the Chicago World’s Fair
he hosted a soycentric feast

  
The ingredient had been a staple
in Asian cuisine for centuries

  
but Ford’s dinner— full of soy substitutes
for dairy meat and wheat—

  
took the integration of soy
into food a step further

  
Today soy is in so many foods 
that most people consume it every day

  
without even knowing it

  
So what makes soybeans so versatile

  
And is our global obsession
healthy or harmful

  
Soybeans have been cultivated in Asia
as early as  years ago

  
but since then they’ve spread 
across the globe

  
Part of soy’s success is that 
the crop can be grown easily and cheaply

  
in variable conditions

  
And once they’re grown

  
soybeans have an incredibly high density
of proteins and fats;

  
ingredients which in recent years
have been used in everything

  
from mayonnaise to biodegradable plastic

  
The ideal method
for separating these components

  
depends on what you’re trying to extract

  
To isolate soy proteins dehulled beans 
are sometimes pressed through rollers

  
to create thin flakes and then steeped 
in water to draw out the proteins

  
Alternatively whole beans can be simply
soaked and ground

  
into a whitish protein rich liquid

  
In both cases the resulting substance 
can be used to make spongy foods

  
like tofu or filtered to produce soymilk

  
And at the industrial scale

  
these proteins can be used in various ways
to help make processed foods

  
Soy fats may be even more versatile

  
In one extraction method

  
soybeans are dried cleaned 
and then fed into an extruder

  
This machine simultaneously heats
and presses the beans

  
producing a liquid containing soy oil
and other fatty components

  
By adding water and spinning the mixture
components are separated into two parts

  
refined soy oil for things like salad
dressing and a substance called lecithin

  
Lecithin is made of molecules
called phospholipids

  
which have a phosphate head that attracts
water and a tail that attracts fats

  
These features make phospholipids
excellent for blending ingredients

  
that naturally separate from each other

  
This process is called emulsification

  
and soy lecithins are used 
as an emulsifying agent

  
in a huge variety of foods

  
For example during chocolate production

  
phospholipids attach to both the fatty
components of the cocoa butter

  
and the watersoluble sugar particles

  
making them easier to combine
into a smooth mixture

  
A similar process happens 
in powdered products

  
that need to be instantly rehydrated

  
Soy lecithin bonds with the water

  
and helps the powder 
disperse more quickly

  
While there are other plants 
we can process for lecithin and proteins

  
soy’s mild taste 
and widespread availability

  
have earned it a place 
in thousands of food products

  
But is it unhealthy to be eating
this much soy

  
Not really

  
Soybeans contain many of the essential
amino acids our bodies need

  
making them one of the best ways 
to get these proteins without eating meat

  
And the beans’ fat content is largely
made up of socalled “good” fats—

  
poly and monounsaturated fatty acids

  
which can decrease cholesterol 
and reduce the risk of heart disease

  
There are some compounds in soy

  
that may inhibit our body’s absorption
of various minerals

  
And about % of the general population
has a soy allergy

  
which can be severe in rare cases

  
But for many people the biggest complaint
about soy consumption

  
is the occasional increase in flatulence

  
Outside our bodies however
soy is much more worrying

  
To accommodate the soy farms needed
for heavy industry

  
processed foods and livestock feed 
huge swaths of land have been deforested

  
Between  and  roughly
 square kilometers of the Amazon

  
were cleared for soy production

  
In some regions this has also led
to the displacement of farmers

  
and indigenous communities

  
So if we want to keep using soy
and all its byproducts

  
we’ll need to find a way 
to do it humanely and sustainably

  
Pasture is the single
largest type of land

  
on the surface of the Earth today

  
thanks to our taste for meat and dairy

  
Just over a quarter of all land
is used for livestock

  
That's more than forests
or farm fields or anything else

  
Most of that land is best for ruminants

  
such as cows

  
that can digest highfiber feed
such as grass and straw

  
However the process by which grass
and fiber is broken up

  
in the stomachs of cows
and other grazing ruminants

  
has a byproduct methane

  
a potent greenhouse gas

  
Despite what you might have heard
about methane and cows

  
most of the methane
is actually burped out

  
not through the back end

  
(Laughter)

  
And that represents
about two billion tons

  
of carbon dioxide equivalent per year

  
or more than four percent of our annual
global greenhouse gas emissions

  
We have a methane problem from cows

  
So how can you reduce these methane burps

  
My colleagues and I
may have found a solution

  
Seaweed!

  
Let me explain

  
A couple of years ago

  
an article was published
by Rob Kinley and colleagues

  
that showed almost complete
elimination of methane

  
when seaweed was added
to chopped grass in the lab

  
Great

  
But as an agricultural researcher

  
I know lots of additives
work well in the lab

  
but not in real animals

  
But there was something
different about seaweed

  
and the way in which it reduced methane

  
So we thought we should
test this in live animals

  
In collaboration with Joan Salwen

  
an entrepreneur

  
and colleagues from
James Cook University and CSIRO

  
we decided to conduct a small experiment

  
to determine the amount of seaweed
we might need to use

  
This was the first ever
experiment in dairy cattle

  
and we had no idea how much to give them

  
So we started with about  grams per day

  
going up to  grams

  
Mind you this was mixed in
with  kilograms of their feed

  
One of the graduate students
I work with Breanna Roque

  
trapped their methane burps

  
(Laughter)

  
In that first experiment

  
the emissions were reduced
by up to  percent

  
(Applause)

  
And I thought at first

  
the equipment must have
malfunctioned but it was real

  
But we are left with more
questions than answers

  
Would the microbes
in the gut get used to it

  
and start producing methane over time

  
Would the seaweed be stable
over a long period of time in storage

  
Would the taste be affected
and the cows turn up their noses

  
Or would the seaweed affect
the cows's health or milk production

  
So we teamed up again
to conduct another trial

  
Over a fivemonth period

  
we saw the seaweed
that was harvested three years prior

  
reduce emissions by over  percent

  
(Applause)

  
Our colleagues in Australia

  
they saw up to  percent
reduction in a similar trial

  
That kind of reduction
is simply staggering

  
And in the graph

  
you see methane emissions
in three levels of intake

  
So the first line
is for cattle with no seaweed

  
The second line is for cows

  
that were supplemented
with about  to  grams of seaweed

  
And the last one is for cows

  
supplemented with
about  to  grams of seaweed

  
As you can see as you increase
the amount of seaweed

  
you see a reduction in methane emissions

  
We have also seen
an improvement in bulking up

  
of the beef cattle
with no adverse health effects

  
So it’s a win for the environment;

  
it's a win for the farmers and consumers

  
A panel of  people got to taste steak

  
made from steers offered
seaweed and control

  
And they did not detect any difference

  
We also did a nutritional
quality of the meat

  
and we found no difference between
animals that were offered seaweed

  
and the control

  
So how does it work

  
Some seaweeds contain ingredients

  
that directly inhibit microbes
in the cow’s gut from forming methane

  
without interfering with food digestion

  
The amount of methane produced

  
is dependent on how much
the animal is eating

  
and what's in the diet

  
And as such

  
previous efforts to reduce
methane emissions

  
focused on changing their diets

  
or improving forage quality

  
And we do have potential solutions
other than seaweed

  
to reduce methane emissions

  
We looked at additives to feed
such as NOPs

  
reduce emissions by about  percent

  
Even garlic and citrus extract

  
can reduce methane burps
by over  percent

  
without affecting
animal health and productivity

  
Now you may ask

  
Why not stop eating
beef and drinking milk

  
Audience member Yeah!

  
(Laughter)

  
EK That would be a good question

  
So adopting a plantbased diet
with supplements

  
may help shrink
a person's carbon footprint

  
in highincome countries like the US

  
But you know a lot of people
are not going to do that

  
And for the rest of the world

  
these foods are needed
to provide key nutrients

  
such as vitamin B and vitamin A

  
which are critical for brain function

  
for vision and immunity

  
These are found almost exclusively
in beef and milk

  
In this graph you see different countries

  
with their annual meat consumption
per capita on the bar graph

  
and then you see the dots
representing the stunting rate

  
in children below the age
of five years old

  
And countries that have lower
consumption of methane

  
are associated with higher
incidence of stunting

  
I know this firsthand

  
Growing up in Eritrea

  
I loved milk and meat
when you could get it

  
which wasn't often

  
Even as a kid I always wondered

  
how a cow eating just grass
produces nutritious milk I love to drink

  
And that wonder pushed me
into a career to understand

  
and improve livestock production

  
so that people in lowincome countries
do not suffer with stunting

  
and other nutrientdeficiency diseases

  
(Applause)

  
So what now

  
We know seaweed can work

  
But the cultivation of the specific
seaweed has been a barrier

  
It's not so easy to farm
asparagopsis taxiformis

  
But there are a number of efforts
going on at the moment

  
to scale up production

  
Blue Ocean Barns is growing
seaweed in Hawaii already

  
and they estimate that there will be
enough production to feed all cattle

  
in the US by 

  
All we need now
is for governments to step up

  
and facilitate the use
of these methanebusting feed additives

  
Cattle industries in some countries

  
have already committed
to climate neutrality by 

  
But if we can get these
feedadditive innovations

  
into cow stomachs earlier

  
we can cut methane burps significantly

  
Given that methane only lasts
in the atmosphere for a decade or so

  
we could even slow global warming
in the short term

  
Yes we have a methane problem from cows

  
but we may have seaweed
and other solutions

  
for these methane burps

  
helping us provide meat and dairy
while maintaining a safe climate

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
If you've gone to a tech conference

  
literally any tech conference
in the last five years

  
you would walk away with the impression
that the connected easytonavigate

  
clean and green smart city
is just around the corner

  
The reality and the hype is

  
that many companies are working
on products and solutions to get there

  
Take transportation for example

  
Allegedly in the city of the future

  
you will be able to seamlessly plan
your journey from public transportation

  
to shared autonomous taxis
and even electric scooters

  
If you own a car it will be electric

  
and there will be charging stations
strategically placed throughout the city

  
So all you do is type
your location into your GPS

  
and it will automatically
take you to your location

  
in the minimum amount of time

  
and any payment you need for charging

  
will be done automatically
in the background

  
Now you might say wait a minute

  
there are companies
that are doing this today

  
I can do this today

  
But it’s individual companies

  
and it's certainly not ubiquitous
across the city

  
But it doesn't just stop
with transportation

  
Let's take health

  
In the future there will be airquality
monitors at every street corner

  
and they will be connected
with your asthma inhaler

  
so that you know when it's safe to go out

  
Or there will be infrared cameras

  
that are measuring the temperature
of citizens anonymously

  
and that will be connected
with your thermometer

  
so that we can detect future outbreaks

  
And of course you will also have
your wearable device

  
that connected to your bathroom scale
and your smart refrigerator

  
so that nutritionists doctors
and other companies

  
can come up with new ways
to keep you you know

  
slim and and trim as I am

  
Then of course there's shopping

  
I mean when you shop today you know

  
you purchase from different retailers

  
and you receive multiple shipments
during the course of the day

  
Now if you had an app
where you could set your preferences

  
and those shipments can be consolidated

  
and maybe you receive
fewer shipments during the week

  
a little bit less convenient

  
but you get to reduce
your carbon footprint

  
So these are all great ideas
and solutions and products

  
that companies are working on

  
but they all share
an underlying requirement

  
that could make that smart city

  
more of a distant dream
than a reality just around the corner

  
And that is the need for greater sharing
of data across companies

  
individuals and cities

  
And if there's one thing
that we've learned

  
is that companies
don't like to share data

  
they don't even like to share
our own data with us

  
So let alone data
with competitors or partners

  
And therein lies the dilemma

  
because if we want to have a chance
at really combating climate change

  
we need to have our cities become
as smart and as connected

  
as quickly as possible
and as many cities as possible

  
So we need to overcome
this fear of data sharing

  
and move towards the smartcity future

  
But why is it that companies
fear sharing data

  
Well it’s what I call “FOMA”

  
Not FOMO

  
the fear of missing out
on a great party or either opportunity

  
but FOMA the fear of missing out
on competitive advantage

  
Data is a source of competitive advantage

  
So why would companies want to give it up

  
In our research over the last two years

  
we've been looking
at many different solutions

  
that would improve the citizen experience

  
and as well sustainability
solutions for cities

  
And what we found is that  percent
of those solutions

  
require much more data sharing

  
across companies individuals and cities

  
So the question really comes

  
how do we motivate companies
to share more of their data

  
We need to actually
overcome this fear quickly

  
if we want to make meaningful
progress on climate change

  
Well as we talked
to a number of companies

  
that were building platforms
and ecosystems in different verticals

  
like logistics transportation

  
smart buildings smart cities

  
we asked about what it would take
to drive greater data sharing

  
across these different solutions

  
And what we heard were the usual concerns

  
data sharing is costly it’s complicated

  
And companies were concerned
about unintended disclosures

  
that could risk their brand

  
However there was one exception

  
And this I think is promising

  
Companies were more willing
to share their data

  
if it could serve a broader common purpose
beyond commercial motivations

  
And in particular

  
they're more willing to share their data
beyond their own four walls

  
if that data sharing could help
fight climate change

  
Let's take for example
a few car companies

  
that actually are fierce competitors

  
and they got together

  
and started to share detailed mapping data

  
so they could develop better solutions
for routing trucks

  
so they spend less time idling

  
and also could route trucks in a city

  
based on prevailing
wind patterns to reduce smog

  
These are pretty cool solutions
that companies are working on

  
But the real question is

  
if this common purpose
of fighting climate change

  
can help leaders overcome
their data sharing FOMA

  
how do we get them to actually do it

  
Well in our work we found
that it takes three actions

  
to jumpstart a virtuous cycle
of data sharing and innovation

  
First companies need to look for new
unexpected sources of data

  
Second they need to develop new
sustainability solutions quickly

  
And third they need to act
together for change

  
Let's take finding new
unexpected partners for data

  
Well what I mean by that

  
is looking well beyond
the four walls of a company

  
for sources of data that can be combined
with a company's own

  
to analyze and develop
new sustainability solutions

  
But let me give a specific example

  
Let's take farming

  
Farming historically
has been more art than science

  
You've had farmers that make
decisions on when to plant

  
what fertilizer to apply
when to irrigate etc

  
based on their own personal experience
and knowledge of the farm

  
Do you remember "Star Trek"

  
and when Spock could scan
the surface of a planet

  
to know what the habitat was
using the sensors from the “Enterprise”

  
and they could tell whether the planet
could support human life

  
Well I know I'm dating myself
and I'm a bit of a geek

  
but that science fiction
is becoming a reality today

  
You have data from satellites

  
from drones from sensors on the field

  
from connected farming equipment
that is collecting data

  
All of that can be combined

  
so that farmers can make
better realtime decisions on

  
how to improve their overall crop yield

  
reduce the amount of fertilizer
and other chemicals they need

  
and also conserve
scarce resources like water

  
So they can improve their income

  
lower their costs

  
and now they can even start
generating new income sources

  
by planting carbonabsorbing crops
and getting paid for that

  
So really quite fascinating
what's happening in agriculture

  
Next comes innovating quickly
new sustainability solutions

  
What I'm talking about is not
your typical long product road map

  
but we need to have companies
hire data scientists

  
that can analyze all these
different data sources

  
and in new agile ways

  
bring new products and services to market

  
We need to use data and digital quickly
to fight climate change

  
Finally acting together

  
Now let me come back
to the smartcity example

  
If we had transportation
companies and utilities

  
and buildings share data with the city

  
then the city could make better decisions
on investing in renewable energy projects

  
That could mean that you lower
your energy bill

  
and also reduce your carbon footprint

  
Or that transportation data
can be used to decide

  
where charging stations are needed

  
so that we can accelerate the speed
of adoption of electric vehicles

  
And that means maybe you spend
less time in traffic

  
but also your air is cleaner

  
So to really make progress
on more sustainable energy

  
we need to have data sharing across
buildings transportation and utilities

  
All of this data sharing needs to come
together for a brighter future

  
Now 

  
You also have a critical role to play

  
Of course we individually need to be
in control of our own data

  
Imagine you have an app
that allows you to set preferences

  
so that data from your car
from your utilities

  
from your shopping patterns can be shared

  
and you can make decisions
about your own carbon footprint

  
in a very easy way

  
So you can run "what if" scenarios

  
What if I purchase an electric car

  
What if I take the train
from Boston to New York versus fly

  
Or what if I change my shopping pattern
so I shop more locally

  
How much will that impact
my overall carbon footprint

  
Would you be willing to share more data

  
to have more sustainable climate

  
and to make those
climatefriendly decisions

  
Well I for one I'm pretty
excited about this future

  
a future where greater data sharing

  
can really help us
jointly combat climate change

  
What we need is for company leaders
to move away from FOMA

  
and back to good oldfashioned FOMO

  
The future is bright
if all that data can be shared

  
and I don't think
we really want to miss out

  
Thank you

On October st   residents 
of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood

  
approached William Simpson
who’d just bought a plot in the area

  
and told him to leave

  
The Simpsons would be the second 
Black family

  
in the otherwise white neighborhood  
where they intended to build a home

  
When the Simpsons refused offers 
to buy them out

  
their neighbors tried blocking
their home’s construction

  
They finally moved into their house 
but the incident had a ripple effect

  
Just a few months 
after the mob harassed the Simpsons

  
the first racially restrictive covenant
was put into place in Minneapolis

  
Covenants are agreements in property deeds
that are intended to regulate

  
how the property is to be used

  
Beginning in the mids

  
people in the United States and elsewhere
began employing them in a new way

  
specifically 
to racially restrict properties

  
They wrote clauses into deeds that were 
meant to prevent  all future owners

  
from selling or leasing 
to certain racial and ethnic groups

  
especially Black people

  
Between  and 

  
these racial covenants spread
like wildfire throughout the US

  
making cities more segregated 
and the suburbs more restricted

  
In the county encompassing Minneapolis

  
racial covenants eventually appeared 
on the deeds to more than  homes

  
Not only was this legal

  
but the US Federal Housing Administration

  
promoted racial covenants 
in their underwriting manual

  
While constructing new homes

  
real estate developers began racially
restricting them from the outset

  
Developments were planned as dream
communities for American families—

  
but for white people only

  
In  one company began building
what became widely recognized

  
as the prototype of the postwar American
suburb Levittown New York

  
It was a community 
of more than  identical homes

  
They cost around $ each 
and were intended to be affordable

  
for returning World War II veterans

  
But according to Levittown’s 
racial covenants none of the houses

  
could “be used or occupied by any person 
other than members of the Caucasian race”

  
with one exception servants

  
Between  and 

  
the population of the American suburbs
nearly doubled

  
as white people flocked 
to more racially homogenous areas

  
in a phenomenon known as “white flight”

  
The suburbs spread

  
replacing native ecosystems with miles
of pavement and waterguzzling lawns

  
And their diffuse layout necessitated
car travel

  
American automobile production quadrupled
between  and 

  
cementing the nation's dependence on cars

  
Federal programs like the GI Bill
offered American veterans

  
favorable lending rates for buying homes

  
But it was difficult for people of color
to take advantage of such resources

  
Racial covenants restricted them
from certain neighborhoods

  
And at the same time government programs
labelled neighborhoods of color

  
bad investments and often refused
to insure mortgages in those areas

  
Therefore banks usually wouldn’t lend
money to people purchasing property

  
in neighborhoods of color—
a practice that became known as redlining

  
So instead of owning homes 
that increased in value over time

  
creating wealth that could be passed
to future generations

  
many people of color were forced
to spend their income on rent

  
And even when they were<i </iable 
to buy property

  
their home’s value was less likely
to increase

  
The suburbs boasted culdesacs 
and dead ends that minimized traffic

  
Meanwhile city planners often identified
redlined neighborhoods

  
as inexpensive areas 
for industrial development

  
So the massive freeway projects 
of the midth century

  
disproportionately cut 
through redlined neighborhoods

  
accompanied by heavy industry
and pollution

  
As a result many neighborhoods of color
experience higher rates

  
of drinking water contamination asthma
and other health issues

  
People targeted by racial covenants
increasingly challenged them in court

  
and in  they were finally banned
under the Fair Housing Act

  
But the damage had been done

  
Racial covenants concentrated wealth
and amenities in white neighborhoods

  
and depressed the conditions 
and home values in neighborhoods of color

  
As of  about % of white families 
in the US owned their homes

  
while about % of Black families did

  
That gap is greatest 
in Minnesota’s Twin Cities

  
Across the country
neighborhoods remain segregated

  
and % of all suburban counties
are predominantly white

  
Some landlords real estate agents
and lenders

  
still discriminate against people 
based on race—

  
rejecting them steering them to and away 
from certain neighborhoods

  
or providing inaccessibly
high interest rates

  
Gentrification and exclusionary 
zoning practices also still displace

  
and keep people of color
out of certain neighborhoods

  
Racial covenants are now illegal

  
But they can still be seen
on many housing deeds

  
The legacy of racial covenants is etched
across the pristine lawns

  
of the American suburbs

  
It’s a footnote in the demographic divides
of every city

  
And it’s one of the insidious architects
of the hidden inequalities

  
that shape our world

  
My very first food memory
was when I was three or four

  
It was a warm day

  
and my mom had just picked me
and my sister up from school

  
buckled us into the back
of her dusty blue Ford Taurus

  
She was halfway out
of the school parking lot

  
when she pulled over to the side

  
She strangely reached for her purse
that was resting on the dashboard

  
started fishing around for something
until she found it

  
Then she twisted around to us

  
and she tore open a yellow paper bag

  
of slightly melted Sugar Babies

  
(Audience murmurs)

  
She poured a few of the pellets
into each of our tiny hands

  
Now I want to be clear

  
this was not a normal mom thing

  
This was breaking several rules

  
It was after lunch but before dinner

  
we were in the car

  
(Laughs)

  
we hadn't done anything spectacular
to be celebrated

  
And Sugar Babies are well pure sugar

  
I was so confused

  
But I was a kid so I took the candy
and I started chewing

  
God I felt like I had just been inducted
into the coolest club possible

  
The one that eats candy
on a random Wednesday

  
(Laughs)

  
And then the world it slowed down

  
Everything faded

  
And then everything sharpened

  
There is only one word
for what I felt in that moment

  
Magic

  
Real magic

  
Now most people think
that’s kind of crazy

  
three or four years old

  
I don't remember anything
about my childhood for years after that

  
but I remember that day

  
I remember those Sugar Babies

  
and I remember that feeling

  
Now most people think of magic
as a trick right

  
Abracadabra

  
This seemingly impossible act
put on purely for entertainment

  
But I'd like to challenge that

  
Magic real magic is not an illusion

  
Real magic is the feeling

  
when life transforms
from the ordinary into the extraordinary

  
And not only is it real

  
It is the very thing
that connects us to this world

  
to one another

  
to our entire existence

  
It's the spark of a moment

  
It's the feeling of believing

  
of belonging

  
of getting

  
of being gotten

  
It is the crack

  
that opens up our hearts
and reminds us to let light in

  
Now I own Milk Bar

  
this quirky Americanstyle bakery

  
that I'll tell you
a little bit about later

  
And I have found

  
that magic is often created
by breaking some sort of rule

  
Like the "no sweets before dinner" rule

  
Or wearing overalls
to a corporate board meeting

  
Or simply daring to defy the expectations
of the people around us

  
Now as a kid

  
breaking the rules usually
only got us in trouble right

  
But as adults it's a different story

  
Breaking the rules pushing boundaries

  
challenging the norm

  
asking why why not

  
It does something to us

  
It shakes us from sleepwalking

  
And it makes space for magic to sneak in

  
Now I was raised by matriarchs

  
fierce heroic grandmas
who loved to bake in their free time

  
And they knew good and well that food
was for nutrition and sustenance

  
but they didn't care

  
(Laughs)

  
They'd baked as their way
of breaking the rules

  
They'd make batches of lemon bars
instead of casseroles

  
or onepot wonders

  
And they put those baked goods in baggies

  
and hand them out

  
hand that magic out
to the most unassuming people

  
The newcomer to the neighborhood

  
the mail carrier or my personal favorite

  
the receptionist at the dentist office

  
(Laughs)

  
Now I knew what the receiving end
of magic felt like

  
from that Sugar Baby moment

  
But witnessing what the giving part
of real magic did 

  
It moved these people

  
It was aweinspiring

  
And so I decided

  
that baking would be my way
of making magic in the world

  
creating a moment and then giving it away

  
A magic pyramid scheme basically

  
that I wanted needed more of

  
Only my mom and my grandmas
thought that baking was just a hobby

  
But I knew it could be more than that

  
So I moved to New York City
to become a professional pastry chef

  
I went to culinary school;

  
I climbed the ladder of fancy restaurants

  
making fancy desserts
to become the very best of the best

  
Only 

  
I never found magic in those beautiful
delicate plated desserts

  
I could only find my magic
in a cookie or a slice of cake

  
or a gooey underbaked pie

  
And so when I opened Milk Bar

  
that bakery that I was telling you about

  
I decided I wasn't going to frost
the sides of a cake

  
like the textbooks taught me

  
(Laughter)

  
I decided I was going to load
cookie dough with marshmallows

  
or pretzels and potato chips

  
and butterscotch chips and coffee

  
tossing convention out the window

  
I wanted people to eat birthday cake
not just on their birthday

  
but any day they wanted

  
I knew that my magic came in the form
of these simple baked goods

  
but I also knew that simple
approachable accessible

  
nostalgic flavors

  
were my best jumpingoff place
to create new desserts

  
Almost as though fancy
were the enemy of delicious

  
I’d go to county fairs to nosh

  
I'd go to the diner
and order slices of pie

  
from that revolving display case

  
I'd take french fries and dip them
in chocolate milkshake and dream

  
And then I'd go into the kitchen
and tie on my apron

  
and start mixing up a new creation

  
rooted in something known
and safe and loved

  
but reaching far beyond
what anyone thought accessible

  
Or approachable

  
Or doable

  
Breaking the banking rules
became my daily ritual

  
I mean who says a layer cake can't taste
like salty malty sweet pretzels

  
I mean my culinary instructors for one

  
(Laughs)

  
"Watch me" I'd think

  
And I'd take pretzels

  
toast them in the oven
to deepen their flavor

  
then grind them
into a powderlike consistency

  
and substitute some
of the cake flour in a recipe

  
for that pretzel powder

  
It's pretty good

  
When I was opening Milk Bar
I knew I wanted to serve ice cream

  
A rebellious kind of ice cream

  
No surprise right

  
So I decided to buy a soft serve machine

  
which for the record
was very rebellious at the time

  
I had to decide what flavor to make

  
I mean why do we only accept
chocolate and vanilla

  
as ice cream flavors

  
I needed to come up
with something better different

  
Push that boundary

  
I knew I had to come up
with a flavor of milk

  
that was different

  
Milk is like the base
of any great ice cream

  
So I sat out inspiration
at my hour bodega

  
Favorite place to go

  
Because that's where we all shop

  
that's where our simple
taste buds are formed

  
it's the flavors we know

  
Up and down the aisles till I hit it

  
My favorite section
of the grocery store as a kid

  
the cereal aisle

  
Now as a kid my mom and I
had an agreement

  
I was a pretty picky eater

  
and we agreed that I could have
as much cereal as I wanted

  
as long as I drank
all the calciumrich milk

  
at the bottom of the bowl

  
I mean I thought it was highway robbery

  
Does she not understand how good
that sugary sweet milk was at the bottom

  
That's interesting

  
That's a really delicious flavor of milk

  
It moved me

  
It made sense to me

  
but would it make sense to other people

  
Figured I'd give it a try

  
So I went back to the kitchen

  
and made the equivalent
of a giant bowl of cereal

  
I strained out all that delicious milk

  
and I spun it into ice cream

  
Put it on the menu

  
And I've got to tell you even now

  
people stop me on the street

  
to tell me about their cerealmilk
ice cream moment

  
"So good"

  
"Seemingly a little naughty"

  
I mean how did I know
that was their flavor

  
That's the flavor they eat
when they're wearing pajamas

  
when no one's looking

  
The flavor of their childhood

  
These people will tell me
about every detail of the day

  
They will tell me about the weather
the company they kept

  
the way that an ordinary moment
was transformed into something magical

  
with a simple bite

  
I built my business with the same
"challenge the norm" mentality

  
Rather than measure my business's success
by the profit or loss sheet

  
by the average order value

  
the other metrics that businesses use

  
to know if they're doing well

  
I decided we'd measure our impact
by the twinkle in people's eyes

  
By the "Oh I can't put that down" feeling

  
that they had when they ate
one of our desserts

  
I chose to put women
at the helm of my organization

  
Because when I looked
around the hospitality industry

  
people running operations
folks holding CEO titles

  
they were all men

  
I mean why

  
I was raised by these fierce matriarchs
who handled business

  
and I wanted my organization
to look like that

  
I want to show the world
what women were capable of

  
and what a "bakery" could be

  
Push back on that cute little box
people like to put us in

  
And in turn the rules broke for us

  
The magic our magic got out

  
Word spread without us spending
a dollar on marketing

  
Rare in our industry

  
we grew our business
without diluting the business

  
I mean we won awards

  
no tiny East Village bakery
has any business winning

  
(Laughs)

  
It's pretty incredible

  
Even today

  
I get to witness that feeling

  
that same one that my grandmas
conjured up in my childhood

  
We ship cakes all across the country

  
we keep our doors open from early
in the morning until late at night

  
It's insane for a bakery to do

  
But we do it because we're
obsessed with it

  
We're obsessed with what we do

  
We teach classes we share recipes

  
despite any concerns of copycats

  
or intellectual property infringements

  
because that's what you do

  
when you benefit
from what came before you

  
and you plan on passing it
along long after you

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
When you know you're here
to give not take

  
and leave this place
better than you found it

  
See mom you can bake for a living

  
Pretty cool if you ask me

  
Now I don't have
the full equation cracked

  
but I do know that it starts
with the decision to act

  
My mom she could have driven
that car home routinely

  
but she decided that that day
would not be like the others

  
She threw out that rule book
for just a second

  
I carry this lesson with me

  
that every day has within it hundreds

  
thousands of opportunities
to create real magic

  
Only they disappear

  
Unless you reach out and grab them

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
A few years ago I sailed on a ship
that comes from an earlier era

  
when moving goods by sea
didn't mean polluting the planet

  
Our voyage to the Caribbean
was eyeopening

  
and not just because I learned
that apparently I’m incurably seasick

  
(Laughter)

  
I also saw what it's like

  
when you take away the diesel fumes
and the black smoke

  
that spew from today's
freighters and ports

  
Instead our vessel smelled
like fresh sea breeze

  
and the bags of cardamom we carried

  
and all that camomile tea I was chugging

  
Nearly every modern cargo ship
relies on highly polluting fossil fuels

  
Fortunately there's a way
to clean up the industry

  
beyond just reviving
oldfashioned sailing ships

  
and it's 

  
green ammonia

  
If you know anything about ammonia

  
it's probably that it's stinky
it's toxic it's potentially explosive

  
So it's a great place to start right

  
Ammonia is mainly used today
to make chemicals and fertilizers

  
But for many reasons
industry experts are convinced

  
that ammonia could be a gamechanging way
to drive giant cargo ships

  
and that it could be used safely
and be costcompetitive

  
Tens of thousands of freighters
crisscross the oceans every day

  
bringing the food we eat
the clothes we wear the cars we drive

  
Container ships alone

  
carry some four trillion dollars
worth of goods by sea every year

  
That's roughly the GDP of Germany

  
At the same time

  
the shipping industry
contributes a significant share

  
of the world's annual
greenhouse gas emissions

  
If shipping were a country

  
it'd be the sixth largest emitter of CO

  
trailing just behind Japan

  
And as world economies grow
and populations rise

  
shipping's emissions are expected to soar

  
unless the industry
charts a cleaner course

  
Green ammonia really first came
to my attention in 

  
at the UN Climate Change Conference
in Bonn Germany

  
At the panel I attended
ammonia seemed kind of like an aside

  
or something we should be keeping tabs on

  
Since then the industry
has really coalesced around ammonia

  
as the next dominant shipping fuel

  
Chemical companies and investors

  
are spending millions of dollars
to build green ammonia plants

  
and shipbuilders and manufacturers

  
are busy developing
the necessary technology

  
The first ammoniapowered ships
are just around the corner

  
So what's so special
about this pungent gas

  
Well to start ammonia doesn't contain
any carbon molecules

  
so it doesn't create carbon dioxide
when used as fuel

  
Instead it contains one part nitrogen 

  
which is the main component of air 

  
and three parts hydrogen
which is a building block of water

  
It's possible to make ammonia
without using any fossil fuels

  
That's what makes it "green" ammonia

  
Think of it like this

  
instead of the oil wells
and petroleum refineries

  
that make today's dirty diesel fuels

  
picture solar panels or wind turbines
or hydropower plants

  
Renewable electricity is the foundation
of this whole ammoniamaking ordeal

  
We can start with electrolysis

  
which uses electricity to split water
into hydrogen and oxygen

  
Then renewables can power the process
that separates nitrogen from air

  
And so with our hydrogen and nitrogen
we can combine the two

  
in an industrial process
at high temperatures

  
to make NH  ammonia

  
Now if you want to use
this ammonia to power

  
your thousandfootlong freighter

  
you have two options

  
The first is an internal
combustion engine

  
so similar to how diesel
is used in ships today

  
but with certain modifications

  
Experts think that the first vessels
to use ammonia in their engines

  
will be chemical tankers

  
because they already carry it
in their cargo holds

  
So they'll be like the early adopters

  
The next options is to use a fuel cell

  
Fuel cells create electricity
through a chemical reaction

  
and that's what drives the ship's motors
and turns the propellers

  
In Norway work is underway

  
to launch the world's first
ammoniafuelcell ship

  
in just a few years' time

  
So we can make green ammonia

  
and we can use it
in fuel cells or engines

  
The final piece of the ammonia
puzzle is the infrastructure

  
the storage facilities the pipelines
the distribution networks 

  
everything that's needed to ensure
a ship can fill its tanks

  
anywhere in the world

  
And none of this is particularly novel

  
because we already have infrastructure

  
for the chemical
and fertilizer industries

  
Now it just needs to be built near ports

  
and at a global scale 

  
and with great caution

  
So what's needed
to take ammonia mainstream

  
We can draw a rough parallel
to the rise of electric cars

  
A decade ago

  
about  EVs
were on the roads worldwide

  
Then more and more countries
adopted policies

  
encouraging people to buy EVs

  
supporting manufacturers

  
and to build up charging infrastructure

  
And as sales climbed
and production boomed

  
the cost of batteries
and other components plummeted

  
making it easier for more people
to afford electric cars

  
So now instead of  EVs
it's more like  million

  
and green ammonia
could follow a similar path

  
in the shipping industry

  
Policies to curb emissions
and incentivize green investments

  
could spur a shift away from fossil fuels

  
And as ammonia catches on

  
fuel prices and technology costs
could decline in step

  
enabling more ship operators
to make the switch

  
And while all of that is happening

  
a much bigger story will be playing out
on the global scale

  
the rising development and plunging costs
of renewable energy supplies

  
Giant offshore wind farms

  
sprawling solar arrays
and other technologies

  
could provide the electrons
needed to make that green ammonia

  
Green ammonia might be
the main fuel source

  
on future cargo ships

  
but it doesn’t have to be
the only clean technology onboard

  
Ships will likely use
a combination of tools

  
Batteries can already power
the lights and equipment on giant ships

  
and certainly smaller vessels
can be fully batterypowered today

  
Design fixes like supersleek hulls
and dolphinlike flippers

  
can improve ships' efficiency

  
And another technology
that's quickly gaining traction

  
is called "windassisted propulsion"

  
which puts a modern twist
on an old idea of harnessing wind

  
One cargo ship I sailed on
in the North Sea

  
uses devices called "rotor sails"

  
These are foottall tubes

  
that spin around
like hyperactive barber's poles

  
which produces a forward thrust

  
and reduces demand on the diesel engines

  
It's really exciting to see
these things whip around

  
but it's funny how almost blasé
the crew was about the whole thing

  
They push a button

  
the tubes swirl to life
the ships saves fuel

  
and they can all carry on
with their normal tasks

  
as we sailed from Rotterdam

  
to this industrial eyesore
in northern England

  
and back again

  
Meanwhile of course

  
I spent my time admiring the sails

  
and then curling up in the fetal position
as the sea knocked our ship around

  
The maritime industry
is at a pivotal moment

  
in its long and storied history

  
Over the last few centuries

  
fossil fuels have powered the freighters
that have transformed global trade

  
connecting cotton fields
to farflung garment factories

  
and bringing blueberries
from one side of the equator to the other

  
Coalpowered steamships made it possible
to travel farther and faster

  
and diesel engines
took this into overdrive

  
What began in the early th century
as a humble canal boat

  
puttering along with this tiny engine

  
has since become giant container ships

  
that stretch as long
as skyscrapers stand tall

  
We know that to keep the planet
from warming further

  
we must completely transform the way
that we power our homes our cars

  
and the freighters that bring us
all our precious stuff

  
The shipping industry
must join the rest of the world

  
in addressing climate change

  
and it could do that
with the help of green ammonia

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause)

  
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and wow you’re still reeling

  
You’re a particle of matter 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces

  
fusion and annihilation

  
If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter

  
you'll be the seed of a future galaxy

  
You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game

  
A friendly gluon explains

  
there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles

  
At the blow of a cosmic whistle

  
every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right

  
will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate

  
The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle

  
and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains

  
They’d been waiting for someone like you
as with a perfectly balanced setup

  
no one would be left in the end

  
As guest of honor they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring

  
What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing

  
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like

  
But we can rely on how it should end 
with you as the last particle standing

  
Let's start there and work backwards

  
Just before this there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs

  
Here’s  for the sake of example

  
This right away suggests a strategy

  
You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle

  
by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles

  
then the newly adjacent pairs and so on
to reach this final set

  
If you map them back 
to the original circle

  
standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles

  
or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles

  
means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive

  
So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles

  
You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance

  
of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy

  
You’re soon left alone

  
But wait a minute!

  
Today’s the big day

  
You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races

  
Every hundred million years

  
sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core

  
to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from

  
Each of the  attendees

  
has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter

  
Except you you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor

  
and reenact its moment of choice

  
Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring

  
Your job pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated

  
The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before

  
but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes

  
The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle

  
count cubes of each type
perform arithmetic

  
and carry out simple logical commands

  
How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots

  
Pause to figure it out for yourself
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Let’s go back to our earlier approach

  
running time backwards 
starting from you alone

  
then a sequence of pairs of cubes

  
A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes

  
As does the next and the next
each adding nestled pairs

  
like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles

  
A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate

  
Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right

  
buffering you from antimatter

  
We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum starting with your +

  
For instance this would be +++

  
From your perspective 
no matter how far you look

  
this sum will be positive

  
Considering how we introduced pairs 
this makes sense—

  
each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus

  
If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube

  
its sum will eventually hit zero

  
The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner

  
Again our introduction of pairs 
reflects this;

  
nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes

  
We can now program the device

  
Start a running sum with +
representing you

  
and scan around the circle

  
For each matter cube add one

  
and for each antimatter cube 
subtract one

  
If all  cubes have been scanned

  
without the sum ever hitting 

  
that spot is safe

  
Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks

  
Hello everyone

  
My name is Orit yes

  
And I study insurance

  
Telling people that you study insurance
is not a good way to start a conversation

  
In fact if ever you need
to end the conversation

  
try it tell people you study insurance

  
People don't want to talk about insurance

  
They don't think it's all that exciting

  
But I disagree

  
I find insurance fascinating;
in fact I find it magical

  
And today I'd like to show you why

  
Now the famous author Franz Kafka

  
used to work for an insurance
company in Prague

  
And this is what Kafka
had to say about insurance

  
He said "Insurance is like a religion

  
Insurance is like a primitive religion

  
It's the religion of people
who believe that by having insurance

  
they can ward off evil"

  
So according to Kafka

  
what leads us to buy insurance
is not rational thinking

  
but magical thinking

  
It's the belief that if I have insurance

  
somehow magically those negative events
that I fear in the future

  
they're not going to happen

  
Of course this is totally irrational

  
It's like believing
that if you have an umbrella

  
it's not going to rain

  
If your car gets stolen yes

  
the insurance company
will cushion the blow

  
With the compensation money

  
you could probably afford a new car

  
But the fact that you have insurance

  
does not make your car
less likely to be stolen

  
The risk is the same
whether you are insured or not

  
So are people this naive

  
Do they really believe
that if they have insurance

  
they are less at risk

  
Yes

  
Perhaps not consciously but they do

  
Let me show you

  
In one of my studies

  
I asked people to predict
what is the likelihood

  
that in the future they will suffer
all kinds of medical misfortunes

  
yhat they will need an operation
physiotherapy or nursing care

  
Another group was asked
to make the same predictions

  
but we first asked them

  
"Do you have health insurance"

  
And of course they do

  
Israel has universal coverage

  
Reminding people
that they have health insurance

  
had a fascinating effect

  
It made them feel less at risk

  
Surprisingly the effect
was not limited to medical problems

  
It also made them believe
that they are less likely to lose money

  
and my personal favorite

  
asking people in Tel Aviv
if they have health insurance

  
made the prospect of a war
in Europe seem less likely

  
(Laughter)

  
And that's magic

  
Kafka was right

  
There is an interesting paradox here

  
We buy insurance against those events
that we fear the most

  
But once we are armed
with this protection measure

  
we feel that we are no longer
at risk somehow magically

  
And this protection effect
is not unique to insurance policies

  
We see it with other
protection measures as well

  
Let me show you

  
In  the citizens of Israel

  
were very worried about a possible
military attack by Iran

  
And the government was distributing
gas masks to all the citizens

  
At the time we called people
and asked them to predict

  
what are the chances
that Iran would attack Israel

  
with weapons of mass destruction

  
The ratings were quite high

  
People were worried

  
But if we first asked them
"Do you have a gas mask"

  
then the ratings dropped dramatically

  
And that's magic

  
Apart from the fact
that gas masks are largely useless

  
against weapons of mass destruction

  
the fact that you have a gas mask
is unlikely to affect the strategic

  
or the tactical decision
of a foreign power

  
We have to remember

  
insurance is an antidote
it's not a vaccine

  
It doesn’t ward off evil;

  
it doesn't eliminate
the risks that we face

  
However when it comes to insurance

  
the distinction between
an antidote and a vaccine

  
somehow gets blurred in our minds

  
Why does it happen

  
It happens because people
are not that good

  
at assessing risks rationally

  
Let me give you an example

  
When I arranged my flight to come here

  
I had to decide if I wanted
to buy travel insurance

  
Rationally I should have based
this decision on several considerations

  
the price of the policy of course

  
the value of my luggage

  
the aggravation
that I'm likely to experience

  
if my luggage gets lost

  
And of course the likelihood
of such an event right

  
But most of the time we're just too busy
to make such rational calculations

  
And anyway

  
I doubt that Lufthansa are very keen
to share their damage statistics with me

  
So what do we do instead

  
We rely on our intuition

  
So how do we evaluate risks intuitively

  
We start by imagining
the outcomes that we fear

  
So here I am

  
it's late at night
I'm sitting at this airport

  
all the other passengers
already collected their luggage and left

  
I realize that my own suitcase
is now probably heading to the North Pole

  
Thinking about this scenario
creates anxiety

  
and then we use the level
of anxiety that we feel

  
in order to assess the probability

  
So if I'm feeling terrified

  
I will infer that the risk
of such an event is quite high

  
But you see this is
an intuitive risk estimate

  
It is entirely psychological
and emotionbased

  
which is why it is also highly susceptible
to the magic of insurance

  
Insurance reduces our anxiety

  
First because the outcomes
that we imagine are suddenly less grim

  
Yes I'm sitting at the airport
yes it's late at night

  
all the other passengers had left

  
but there will be this guy there
they would give me a voucher

  
eventually I will get
compensated it's OK

  
Also because we are conditioned
to associate insurance with safety

  
security tranquility and peace of mind

  
And if I'm feeling less anxious

  
I would infer that the risk
is not that high

  
So there you have it

  
I have insurance and the risk is gone

  
But why do we associate insurance
with peace of mind

  
Well first in many languages

  
this is exactly what the word
"insurance" means

  
It comes from the word "sure"
which means lack of doubts

  
no unknowns that would sneak up
and bite you in the future right

  
But also because traditionally

  
this is how insurance was promoted

  
Let me show you an example

  
This is a lovely advertising toy

  
that was distributed to visitors
at the British exhibition in 

  
So you see this guy
and he looks terrified

  
He is barraged by the bricks of doom

  
fire accident falling on his head

  
And the tag on the bottom

  
it reads "anxiety" which perfectly
describes the guy's expression

  
But if you pull on that tag

  
something slides inside
and the guy transforms

  
First he now has the protection
of the Prudential insurance helmet

  
and his expression
is changed into a smile

  
You know why

  
Because Prudential insurance
dispels anxiety

  
Modern images of insurance
convey the same message

  
Insurance logos often incorporate
supporting hand below

  
and umbrellas above ultimate protection

  
And then travel insurance ads

  
They could easily be mistaken
for vacation brochures right

  
Romantic couples
exotic islands palm trees

  
And if for some reason
you need images of smiling

  
happy people wearing white

  
do an image Google search
with the words "pension plans"

  
or "health insurance"

  
Insurance ads rarely show you
sick people smashed cars torn suitcase

  
The message is loud and clear

  
You have insurance

  
all is well in the world

  
However to get us to buy insurance

  
the promoters must also work our fears

  
Which is why right after
you paid a lot of money

  
for a top of the line refrigerator

  
the same seller who just moments ago

  
were explaining
how reliable this product is

  
is now telling you that it may
break down at any moment

  
which is why you should buy
the extended warranty

  
And with some credit cards
you could get free travel insurance

  
All you need to do is to call the agent

  
But when you make this call

  
you are told yeah but the free deal
is only for the basic plan

  
Basic plan doesn't sound
good already right

  
And then you get to hear a list of things
that you are not covered against

  
like fires and heart transplant
and floods etc

  
But if you pay one more
dollar a day right

  
And your active imagination does the rest

  
with each item on the list
your anxiety is mounting

  
and you don't ask yourself
"Hey I'm going to Paris

  
why would I care about a tsunami"

  
You pay the dollar and all is well
in the world again

  
In fact

  
just realizing that we are not
covered against something

  
is enough to distort
our perception of risk

  
I once asked people to imagine
in one of my studies

  
that they're going to go on a trip

  
and they plan to buy
travel insurance at the airport

  
But by the time they reach the counter

  
boarding had already started

  
and they have to board that airplane
painfully aware that they are not covered

  
And then I asked them to assess
all kinds of travelrelated risks

  
And these were dramatically inflated

  
compared to the ratings of people
who did have insurance

  
For example lost luggage

  
the risk of lost luggage
almost  percent

  
What are the chances
that you will need hospitalization

  
Almost  percent well  percent

  
And how about
you will need to be rescued

  
Thirtyone percent

  
I remember the first time
I saw this data I was speechless

  
I was thinking

  
"Guys if this is what you believe
why would you ever leave home"

  
you know

  
(Laughter)

  
Yeah

  
Boarding an airplane
with no insurance is tempting fate

  
It's like realizing that your insurance
policy had just expired

  
and not renewing it

  
Grave danger indeed

  
Your appliances they know you know

  
So we buy insurance
and restore our peace of mind

  
And now you're probably asking yourself

  
"But peace of mind is good

  
What's wrong with peace of mind" right

  
"What's the problem"

  
The problem is that we are highly
likely to be overinsured

  
What does it mean

  
Well first

  
we may be protecting ourselves
against really unlikely events

  
like a tsunami in Paris

  
Or we may be paying a lot
to prevent a trivial loss

  
Does it really make sense to extend
the warranty on an old washing machine

  
And if you will examine
your own policies back at home

  
many of you will find
that you have redundant coverage

  
You are paying several policies
on the same event

  
Many of you do that

  
Me included and I should know better

  
So 

  
This kind of behavior
can get people in debt

  
and even if they don't

  
this is money that we could spend
in far more pleasurable ways right

  
At least I can

  
But selling peace of mind is a problem
for the insurance companies as well

  
Why

  
The insurance companies are well aware
of the problem called “moral hazard”

  
You see when people are insured

  
they become negligent

  
They start leaving
their valuables out in the open

  
They don't check their fire alarms
they drive faster

  
In short they act in ways
which put them at greater risk

  
Now the insurance companies

  
they believe that we behave like that

  
because we know that if something happens

  
someone else will pay

  
Which is why many policies
include deductibles

  
That's the money that comes
out of your pocket right

  
So the deductibles are there to make sure

  
that some of the risk
will stay with the client

  
But based on the research
that I just shared with you

  
it is entirely possible

  
that the reason that we are careless

  
is not just that we think
that someone else will pay

  
but it's also the magical belief
that if I have insurance

  
it's not going to rain

  
The damage is not going to happen

  
and magical thinking
is not susceptible to deductibles

  
What are the lessons to be learned

  
For us for you

  
Next time you consider buying insurance

  
remember Kafka

  
Ask yourself

  
Am I buying insurance
for the right reasons

  
Am I making a sound economic decision

  
or merely trying to please my psyche

  
As for the insurance companies

  
I hope they will consider
changing their message

  
Don't sell magical happiness

  
Encourage us to buy insurance
when it is economically rational

  
and the responsible thing to do

  
And finally

  
guys I hope that next time
someone says "I study insurance"

  
you would say "Wonderful

  
Please tell me more"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Now when you think of the industries
most responsible for climate change

  
you probably summon up
an image of an oil rig right

  
Maybe even a coal mine

  
or a megafarm

  
perhaps heavy engineering

  
But there’s one industry
that’s never mentioned in that list

  
even though every other industry
depends upon it

  
I’m talking about
an economic sector that makes 

  
nothing

  
It has no stock

  
no warehouses

  
no factories

  
It’s entirely powered by brains

  
by spreadsheets

  
and by PowerPoint

  
Who is this mystery industry

  
The professional services
of advertising and PR firms

  
the big management consultancies

  
the corporate lawyers and lobbyists

  
Together this sector is worth
over two trillion dollars a year

  
Let’s call it the “X industry”

  
where X is for influence

  
Now when it comes to climate change

  
each individual firm in this sector
has the carbon footprint

  
probably no bigger
than your average kindergarten

  
But the brainprint of the X industry
is felt everywhere

  
And that’s because these problemsolvers
and storytellers act

  
as the grease in the wheel
of all other businesses on Earth

  
And that gives the X industry
an outsize influence

  
on the likelihood that we reach netzero

  
or they will be one of the primary
architects of climate destruction

  
Now how

  
Remember that oil rig
we imagined a moment ago

  
Think about how it’s actually built

  
I’ve seen this firsthand

  
It takes a village of X industry
advisers to raise a rig

  
First 

  
often

  
the oil exploration proposals
are financially modeled

  
by one of the big constultancies

  
Then the lobbying firms
push through regulatory approval

  
often years if not decades ahead
of a single drop of oil being pumped

  
Then the PR agencies

  
they come in and they work
to get local communities onside

  
And the legal firms
squash any legal objection

  
Finally the creative agencies
craft influence campaigns

  
to help sell the image of the oil industry

  
and to sell the product itself

  
Oil companies know how to drill for oil

  
but they’ve outsourced
almost everything else

  
to this army of publicists
and consultants

  
to lawyers and to lobbyists

  
We all remember the Deepwater
Horizon disaster of 

  
when BP polluted the Gulf of Mexico

  
with over four million barrels of oil

  
What you might not know

  
is that BP admitted

  
to spending three times as much
on promotional advertising

  
in the year after the disaster
than in the year before

  
And arguably

  
the X industry has done
a better job of cleaning up BP’s image

  
than BP has yet done cleaning up
the Gulf of Mexico

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Oh come on come on

  
Is it really fair for me to hold
the X industry responsible

  
for the environmental impact
of their clients

  
There is no official way
to do so just yet

  
We recognize only three scopes
of carbon emission

  
Scopes one and two

  
all the direct emissions
from your fleets and your factories

  
and the power that you purchase

  
In the UK

  
the advertising association has estimated

  
that the entire carbon footprint
of the UK ad industry

  
worth over  billion dollars a year

  
is just  million tonnes

  
 million tonnes

  
Now scope three

  
the third scope

  
this is a bit harder

  
This is all the indirect emissions
from how people use your products

  
or from your supply chain

  
And that’s a necessary headache
for a lot of companies

  
to start taking control over

  
But technically the X industry
barely moves the dial here either

  
That’s why I believe that the X industry
needs a new scope X

  
a way to account
for the emissions of influence

  
Now the 

  
(Applause)

  
The experts at the Purpose
Disruptors network have made a start

  
at doing just that

  
They looked at a single
advertising campaign made for Audi

  
Now this campaign won one of the big
effectiveness awards in advertising

  
And the car company
and their advertising agency claimed

  
that this single campaign
generated  billion dollars

  
of incremental revenue for Audi

  
The ad campaign sold a lot of cars

  
And if their claim is correct

  
it also generated  million tonnes
of additional carbon for Audi

  
So this is a onetofive ratio

  
between the impact
of an entire industry 

  
the entire ad industry 

  
versus one single advertising campaign

  
It is time for those of us like me

  
who work in this industry

  
to take our responsibility seriously

  
And that starts with being honest
about who pays our bills

  
The X industry is famously
murky about that

  
And so my firm in  produced
the first client disclosure report

  
It’s very simple

  
We just disclosed our revenue
by the client industries which we serve

  
I’m so pleased to say
that  other ad agencies

  
consultancies and PR companies

  
have now promised to do the same

  
(Applause)

  
But our industry is dominated
by a handful of really big consultancies

  
and advertising agencies

  
and not one of them
have yet promised to join us

  
And this really matters

  
because the X industry is hiring up
many of the most inventive

  
creative

  
knowledgeable

  
and influential minds that humanity has

  
And those are the exact
same skills that we need

  
to change the course of climate change

  
Now we need all of that X industry talent
to stop serving destruction

  
and start serving solutions

  
And if you work in the X industry

  
you’re probably beginning to feel
a little bit uncomfortable right now

  
Good

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I want you to ask yourself

  
Are you selling your talent
to the right people

  
Are you serving the causes
of climate change or the solutions to it

  
And are you using all that vaunted ability
to influence your clients

  
or just to influence their critics

  
This must be the solutions decade

  
and we’re nearly two years into our window

  
to change our systems
towards climate justice

  
towards clean energy

  
circular systems

  
sustainable and equitable lifestyles

  
This solutions decade desperately requires
really goodquality financial modeling

  
It requires a really strong
legal framework

  
great research

  
It really needs public support

  
It needs the right regulatory rules

  
And it needs creative storytelling

  
and that’s what my X industry
could deliver

  
This year I changed my job title
to “Chief Solutionist”

  
I changed it to constantly remind myself
of the job that needs doing

  
Because as an X industry leader myself

  
I can either serve
the solutions every day

  
or by default

  
I’m serving destruction

  
There is no middle ground here

  
There must be no
carefully worded rationales

  
And the X industry can no longer pretend
it can remain neutral

  
Now if we do that

  
perhaps we could become
a league of solutionists

  
and shift all of this creativity

  
inventiveness

  
knowledge and influence

  
towards fixing climate change

  
And then this invisible

  
and intangible

  
and incredibly influential X industry

  
can finally stop being part of the problem

  
and become part of the solution

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
In the mids two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog

  
Stretching  meters into the sky

  
these ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge

  
But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania

  
they first had to be dismantled
packaged and shipped piece by piece

  
over  kilometers away

  
Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent

  
was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss

  
the project's lead engineers

  
Even before construction began 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition

  
The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor

  
an even more vulnerable target

  
Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business

  
and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery

  
Worse still many engineers thought
the project was impossible

  
The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to kilometerperhour winds

  
swirling tides an endless blanket of fog

  
and the earthquakeprone 
San Andreas fault

  
But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built;

  
and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters

  
more reliable passage to the city

  
He was however a bit out of his depth

  
Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge

  
This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end

  
and extended horizontally
like a diving board

  
Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight

  
Strauss’s design used two cantilevers
linked by a structure in the middle

  
But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss

  
to pursue a different approach
the suspension bridge

  
Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end

  
a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap

  
The result is a more flexible structure

  
that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads

  
This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges

  
And in the s 
advanced steel manufacturing

  
could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope

  
for largescale construction

  
At the time the Golden Gate Bridge

  
was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted

  
and its design was only possible
due to these innovations

  
But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks

  
on the country’s east coast

  
While the recently completed Panama Canal

  
made it possible to ship these components
to California

  
reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly

  
It was relatively easy to find a stable
shallow foundation for the north tower

  
But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting

  
a tenstory building underwater

  
Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations

  
bombs were dropped on the ocean floor
creating openings for pouring concrete

  
A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents

  
and workers operated in minute shifts
between tides

  
The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans

  
to prevent getting lost

  
And at one point an earthquake rocked
the south tower

  
nearly  meters in each direction

  
Strauss took worker safety very seriously
requiring hard hats at all times

  
and stretching a safety net 
below the towers

  
But not even these precautions 
could prevent

  
an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 

  
carrying ten workers to their deaths

  
Once the towers were complete 
workers spun the cables in place

  
hung suspenders at foot intervals
and laid down the concrete roadway

  
The bridge was finished
but there was still one more task ahead

  
painting it

  
After production the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer

  
it maintained throughout construction

  
But the Navy had been pushing hard

  
to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow

  
Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself

  
paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone

  
Citing numerous letters from locals

  
Morrow’s page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange”

  
beat out the Navy’s plans

  
And today this iconic color 
still complements

  
the strait’s blue water green hills 
and rolling fog

  
When we look at poor
smallholder farmers across the world

  
and particularly in my country India

  
we often think that what they need
is access to better tools

  
education government support
markets and so on

  
Yes they need all that

  
But what they really need
is a reliable and regular income

  
to live with dignity

  
A dependable income

  
even if it is as small
as  dollars a month

  
is essential for them
to stay out of poverty

  
Today their incomes
are in and out of poverty

  
which is extremely painful

  
Growing up in South India

  
I could not overlook
what poverty did to our farmers

  
I was about  years old when one day

  
I saw a farmer in my village
sitting next to a farm stream

  
and eating something from the ground

  
Something did not seem right

  
I walked up to him
to see what was going on

  
I was shocked to see him eat mud

  
Mud

  
Brown soft mud from the stream

  
I was afraid he might die

  
I yelled at him

  
"What is this stupid mudeating business"

  
He looked at me helplessly and said

  
"I'm a farmer my crops failed;

  
my stomach doesn't know
that my pocket is empty"

  
I walked away quite helplessly

  
That night I shared this
with my grandfather

  
He was a remarkable man very clever

  
He was a part of the Indian
freedom struggle

  
under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi

  
Unlike me he wasn't surprised at all

  
He knew of people
who added rice starch to mud

  
to calm their hunger

  
And he told me something profound

  
If you see a person walking
on the road without footwear

  
it is important to understand
the root cause

  
that the person doesn't have enough money
to probably buy the footwear

  
I finished my college

  
started working with a big company

  
but that incident kept coming back to me

  
Why are smallholder farmers
in such abject poverty

  
What causes them to be so desperate

  
and why is it that
even in stcentury India

  
one farmer dies by suicide
every  minutes

  
My cofounders and I spent about six months
traveling across India

  
meeting hundreds of farmers
to listen to them

  
It became clear that climate risk
is the root cause

  
that causes farming to be
unpredictable and unviable

  
Farmers who make
reasonable money in one season

  
can fail miserably in the next

  
And farmers who could grow crops
earlier in summers

  
no longer get to grow crops in summers

  
Heat is so much more

  
The wells are drying up

  
every year there are new varieties
of pests and diseases

  
Farmers told us that this is all
because of because of God

  
I said "What"

  
"This is all because of God"

  
God is the one who caused it
God is the only one who can solve it

  
God in that context
I did not see as a sign of hope

  
I read it as a sign of helplessness

  
We heard from the farmers

  
They knew the problem

  
but they could not use
these two words "climate risk"

  
So we got together a team of engineers

  
scientists designers
from about six countries

  
to cocreate a solution with our farmers

  
which is quite unconventional

  
And the solution is “greenhouseinabox”

  
We call it "Kheyti Rakshak"

  
It’s a microgreenhouse

  
It's a beautiful greenhouse

  
which sits in a small portion
of the farmer's land

  
It's easy to build a small structure

  
covered with netting on all sides

  
which cuts off heat
prevents bugs and saves water

  
We can't cool the entire
planet in one day

  
but we definitely can create a climate
for a small portion of a farmer’s land

  
to be suitable for farming

  
From our first experiences
of growing vegetables 

  
staple vegetables like tomatoes
cabbage cucumbers 

  
we observed that greenhouses
can increase yields up to seven times

  
and use  percent less water

  
All this was too good to be true

  
All these things
are so difficult to happen

  
so farmers couldn't believe it
unless they actually saw it in action

  
So to make this happen

  
we had to have the courage
to reimagine agriculture 

  
reimagine agriculture
for smallholder farmers

  
After all this is not to grow tomatoes
in an industrial setting in Alaska

  
in winters

  
It is to grow tomatoes
for a smallholder farmer

  
by a smallholder farmer
in sizzling hot Indian summers

  
So this greenhouse had to be small enough
to fit in a portion of their land

  
easy enough for them to use

  
and cheap enough for them to buy

  
One of the biggest challenges
that we could overcome in the process

  
is financing

  
Thanks to our financing partners

  
today this greenhouse
is available with financing

  
which is fast enough and cheap enough

  
The greenhouse costs about  dollars

  
Farmers pay a down payment
of about  dollars

  
and the rest is financed through a loan

  
And this lifechanging asset

  
adds and extra  dollars of profit
on average to a household

  
month on month

  
This is a good double
of what they otherwise make

  
Marginal fiveten percent increases
in the incomes of smallholder farmers

  
cannot move the needle forward much

  
because the baseline is way too low

  
We need a significant
jump in their income

  
and that income has to be
reliable and dependable

  
To ensure that farmers succeed

  
we also provide quality seeds nutrition

  
training and advisory
leveraging mobile technology

  
We rolled out the solution
after quite a few tests with farmers

  
about three years ago

  
and we are marching towards
 farmers in this year

  
and looking at  farmers
over the next five years

  
Hopefully every smallholder
farmer in my lifetime

  
(Applause)

  
The best technologies in agriculture
can reach the smallest of the farmers

  
if we do two things well

  
listen to the farmer with curiosity
empathy and compassion

  
and keep smallholder farmers
particularly women farmers

  
at the center of the design

  
and build solutions

  
Then we can cocreate
mini solutions like Kheyti Rakshak

  
which bring dignity hope and stability
to the lives of the farmers

  
In this big fight against climate change

  
we all have to remember that we should
take our smallholder farmers along;

  
it is our collective responsibility

  
India is a home for about  million
smallholder farmers

  
I dream of a day

  
when "smallholder farmer" becomes
synonymous with a happy farmer

  
and being forced to eat mud
should never be a feature again anywhere

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Yuchi F’as@^

  
English Good afternoon

  
I come from the Yuchi
and Anishinaabe nations

  
My home is in Oklahoma

  
I have been a community organizer
for Indigenous rights

  
environmental justice and climate justice

  
for more than  years

  
I don't believe that I'm old enough
to do anything for that long

  
but here I am

  
(Applause)

  
I'm an Indigenous woman who lives
in the heart of oil and gas country

  
And what that means for me
is that I am in a constant state

  
of thinking about the environment
and climate change

  
And so I want to share
a few things that I know

  
and have learned
along the way in my work

  
One is

  
we cannot rely on those
who created the problem to fix it

  
(Applause)

  
Two we need to move with an urgency
that is not happening now

  
And three

  
we need leaders
who are experiencing the harm

  
to be the ones coming up
with the solutions

  
So it is clear that world leaders
are looking for solutions

  
to this climate crisis

  
but they are looking for them
through a lens of the economy

  
And so that means they are moving
with a casualness

  
that doesn't make it seem
like there's a real emergency

  
And they’re also being sold then
solutions that are basically bandaids

  
and not actual cures to the problem

  
They're being sold techno fixes
and market schemes

  
that really maintain business as usual

  
And instead

  
we need to be thinking
about what could be different

  
So I was recently at the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change COP

  
that just happened in Glasgow Scotland
just this past month

  
And it was apparent to me

  
that those who created the agenda
are also part of the problem

  
First of all

  
they created an admittance policy
that was really a policy of exclusion

  
for many grassroots communities
across the world

  
and especially those of the global south

  
That policy also ensured

  
that the largest badge delegation at COP
were fossil fuel lobbyists

  
Can you believe that

  
Actually I can

  
because this has been sort of the norm
at COP since its beginning

  
Which is why we need a shift

  
in who are the leaders
that they're listening to

  
And the shift in leadership
are coming up with the solutions

  
We need the knowledge and expertise
of those at the frontline

  
And by frontline

  
I mean those communities and peoples
who are experiencing climate change today

  
and some who have been experiencing
the harmful effects of climate change

  
for decades now

  
Those are the frontline leaders

  
that we need to be looking to
for their expertise

  
So I want you to imagine with me

  
if at that negotiating table at COP

  
if those who were dealing
with the actual harms today

  
were in that room
and negotiating the solutions

  
What if the people who have been
living sustainable lifestyles

  
and in relationship with the land

  
had been some of those folks
in the room making those decisions

  
What would it have been like

  
if grassroots leaders had been given
significant participation

  
in those negotiations

  
What would be different

  
Well first off

  
this global climate conference
would not have led with netzero

  
as the solution to this
climate crisis we're in

  
Netzero  not actually eliminating
greenhouse gas emissions 

  
but netzero being a sort of greenwashing
of business as usual

  
It basically means that you can
wash your hands of pollution

  
in one community

  
if you can afford to participate
in a few offset programs

  
So for example

  
you can invest in the continued existence
of a forest in South America

  
of Indigenous peoples in their lands
that should capture carbon

  
What it means then you are in theory

  
obligated from the harm
that you've caused a pollution

  
at a facility in another
lowincome community 

  
and very likely community of color 
in another part of the world

  
That's just wrong

  
And it just doesn't work

  
I mean I know people real people

  
I know their names and their families
on both ends of the spectrum

  
of the netzero spectrum

  
I know people who live at the fence line
of harmful oil refineries

  
who are polluting their communities

  
and I know the Indigenous people
who are farming the forests in Brazil

  
And neither of those communities
are benefiting from these programs

  
in ways that are building empowerment
for their communities

  
and building sustainability
for their communities

  
and they're often pressured
into these programs

  
with little or no choice

  
So I want to try to explain
netzero a little bit differently

  
in a way that might be
a little more tangible

  
If you think about it as kind of
like the net part of your paycheck

  
You get a job you negotiate a pay

  
and you feel really excited about that

  
But on that first day that first payday

  
you feel the crunch of it's a lot less
than you thought it was going to be

  
And it's the same with the netzero
emission targets right

  
It sounds good on the front end

  
but when it all comes out in the wash

  
it's much less than what
we need to have happen

  
to impact real significant
change right now

  
So what we need is a shift in leadership

  
We need leaders who are moving
with the urgency

  
that people are feeling harm
and hurt today

  
And we need leaders who are moving
with the values about community

  
and about the land
and the relationship with land

  
Those are the kind of leaders that we need
to have leading with the solutions

  
and the negotiations of addressing
this problem on a worldwide level

  
So that kind of leadership

  
if we just shifted those two things
about urgency and values

  
that would help all of us worldwide

  
Because what we need
is a set of leadership

  
that is going to do the work
that we need to have done

  
which is to move away from dirty
extractive harmful energy

  
to solutions that are local
communitybased communityheld

  
regenerative energy models

  
And they exist

  
They exist in communities
where people are saying

  
"Hey if the government
is not going to help us

  
we’re going to do
what we need to do right now”

  
And they are doing these projects
in their communities

  
So instead of investing
in a carbon capture project

  
that aims to put carbon
pollution into the ground

  
a technology that's not been
proven to really work

  
and still puts communities at harm

  
because it relies on the continued
existence and construction

  
of harmful pipelines that are dangerous

  
prone to leaks and even
explosions sometimes

  
And so 

  
But these community projects
are happening and they're having success

  
and I want to share a few with you

  
So in Richmond California 

  
between two cities

  
and next to a major Chevron oil refinery

  
that is spewing out greenhouse gases

  
and other toxic chemicals
into the neighborhood 

  
community leaders worked
with community organizations

  
like Asian Pacific Environmental Network

  
Rich City Rides Urban Tilth

  
and Communities for a Better Environment

  
And they took on Chevron
to hold them accountable and won

  
And won resources to build
a solar farm in their community

  
They also built a bike coop

  
to encourage young people
and others to bike in the city

  
and built community gardens

  
to grow healthy organic food
for themselves and schools

  
(Applause)

  
In rural Kentucky a community

  
a rural community who has long relied
on coal to fuel their community

  
they've been organizing with Kentuckians
for the Commonwealth

  
and also created a solar project

  
that is helping lowincome families
reduce their utility costs

  
and created thousands of jobs

  
In the Four Corners area of Arizona
Native Renewables

  
a womanled Navajo Hopi organization

  
is providing electricity
from solar to offgrid homes

  
A community that has long been harmed

  
by the devastating effects
of fossil fuel extraction

  
is now able to rely on an energy source
that is clean and Indigenousled

  
(Applause)

  
After hurricane Maria devastated
the islands of Puerto Rico

  
Organización Boricuá worked
with local farmers

  
to provide direct and immediate
support to those communities

  
by providing water shelter

  
health food

  
the weekly agro ecological
brigades and solidarity brigades

  
and they rebuilt homes
and rebuilt farming infrastructure

  
to make sure that they maintained
food sovereignty

  
In Brooklyn New York

  
in a highly industrial
neighborhood of Sunset Park

  
the community organization UPROSE

  
helped lead an effort
to create a solar farm

  
a first community solar coop
in the state of New York

  
It is an  square foot
rooftop solar garden

  
that again is providing
affordable energy to the neighborhood

  
and to small businesses as well

  
The fight against the Line  pipeline
in Minnesota and other states

  
has highlighted the amount of water
that those types of projects have used

  
And it's caused a threat
to the natural wild rice

  
that grows in the lakes there

  
And so community people
have worked to hold state

  
and federal agencies accountable
for water standards

  
in order to protect
their cultural preservation

  
and the wild rice

  
And in New Jersey
Ironbound Community Corporation

  
along with the New Jersey
Environmental Justice Alliance

  
has helped push legislation

  
that has enabled the state
to deny permits

  
any new permits to already
overburdened overpolluted neighborhoods

  
And it's set a standard
for other states to use

  
which has become a historic environmental
justice legislation for the country

  
These are the kinds of solutions
that we need to see happen

  
These are the kind of leadership
that we need to see happen

  
and we need these solutions happening
by the thousands nationwide

  
and even globally

  
Because these solutions
are not only attacking

  
the emissions at their source

  
but they're doing it by providing jobs

  
and wages and policies

  
that are addressing racism
and colonialism and economic inequity

  
This is the kind of leadership we need

  
We need this dramatic
shift to help us all

  
This dramatic shift in leadership

  
Just these two things

  
The urgency in which we move

  
and the values on which we move with

  
My grandmothers taught me
that we need to have care

  
responsibility and action
when it comes to our community

  
And those are the kind of leaders
that we need leading this fight

  
And if we are going to be serious
about addressing this climate crisis

  
here are the steps
that I need people to do

  
I need you to bring frontline leaders
into those negotiating spaces

  
Bring them in

  
Ask them what's happening
and the harms that are happening

  
Ask them what needs to be done

  
And listen hear them

  
And then invest and implement
in exactly what they said

  
in the exact ways they said to do it

  
because those changes are the changes

  
that are going to stop the problems
that we're having

  
and then stop the acceleration
of the climate crisis

  
And it's going to help slow down
the violence of the storms

  
and the sicknesses
that people are dealing with

  
with conditions like asthma and others

  
And it's going to stop you know

  
the continued drought and wildfires

  
Those are the solutions
that we need to have happen

  
And I need you all to help carry

  
not only the ask to shift that
for our communities

  
but also those values

  
So I ask you I invite you
to join me in this

  
and I challenge you to go out

  
and challenge our elected
leaders and others

  
And if they're not doing the right job

  
then tell them who the leaders are
that need to be there

  
We need frontline leaders
to be in the spaces

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Have you ever trodden
on a Lego brick in your bare feet

  
You’re tiptoeing through
your lounge late at night

  
and suddenly that stabbing pain

  
the expletives

  
and the inevitable question

  
“Why do we have so much of this stuff
all over the place”

  
Well that’s really quite simple

  
Your kids love playing with it

  
so you buy more

  
And a confession 

  
I love to watch my kids play with Lego

  
Especially good is when
I see them inventing their own rules

  
and their own worlds

  
So here are my daughters

  
last Saturday

  
making something out of different kits

  
and pieces of string

  
and pieces of wood and dolls
and other objects

  
And I asked them “What is it”

  
And they said to me “Dad of course
it’s a princess flying on a dragon

  
to visit farm animals in New York”

  
Of course what else could it be

  
Kids at play inspire me

  
They’re not afraid to ask “What if”

  
and “Why not”

  
But what kids implicitly know
that adults tend to forget

  
is that play isn’t just about fun

  
Now as a biologist I know that play
is spontaneous and pleasurable 

  
as you can see by the smiles
in this photograph 

  
but also it accelerates
and derisks learning

  
It helps kids to try out new behaviors

  
to refine those behaviors

  
and to imagine what is not

  
but what could be or what will be

  
As a business strategist
dealing with adults

  
I still recommend play

  
In fact play in business
is not just possible

  
I’d argue that it’s essential

  
and even urgent

  
And here’s why

  
Competitive advantage fades away
faster than any time in recent memory

  
In the s

  
if you had a performance edge
over your competitors

  
you could reasonably expect to continue
being a leader for around  years

  
on average

  
But now the halflife of that advantage
has shrunk to just one year

  
That means that shortlived success
is actually still very common

  
but sustained success  becomes very hard

  
and very rare

  
That means that actually reimagination
is the new execution

  
In order to stay on top

  
or even just to tread water
and stay still

  
you need to constantly
reimagine your business

  
But that’s not so simple

  
if you already have
a highly successful business model

  
We become prisoners of the mental models
that underpin our past success

  
In fact I found
in dealing with businesses

  
that you can’t really
stretch your strategy

  
unless you stretch your mind

  
Now play is of course a great way
of stretching your mind

  
Now 

  
I mean there’d be no mistake

  
I’m not suggesting literally

  
that executives huddle around
a conference table

  
with a big pile of Lego bricks 

  
although I’ve done that
and that works too

  
But instead I’ve created a series
of imagination games

  
to help executives
to stretch their thinking

  
Would you like to play with me

  
(Audience nods)

  
Good I'm glad you said that

  
OK so let’s supposing
that you’re stuck in the rut

  
of seeing the world through the lens
of your past and current success

  
I would recommend the “AntiCompany Game”

  
and here’s how it works

  
You get a piece of paper

  
you create a list of everything
which is essential to your strategy 

  
everything which underpinned
your past success

  
everything which is core and sacred 

  
and then you flip it

  
You create the exact
mirrorimage list of assumptions

  
and then you make the best
business case for this antiself

  
You’ll be surprised
at the ideas that it triggers

  
Supposing for example
that you’re the CEO of a hotel chain

  
and playing the game
and flipping the assumptions

  
Let’s assume that inconveniently

  
you don’t actually own any hotels

  
or any rooms

  
or even operate any hotels
or any rooms anywhere

  
Ridiculous 

  
quite possibly 

  
but actually how would you know
the difference between ridiculous

  
and the merely unfamiliar
untried and uncomfortable

  
And who’s to say

  
that something that seems impractical
can’t actually become and evolve

  
into a more powerful idea

  
Actually had the executives of hotels
played the “AntiCompany Game”

  
before 

  
they might have been able to foresee
the appearance of Airbnb

  
the hotelless hospitality company

  
and they might have been able
to stave off disruption

  
by preemptively disrupting themselves

  
Let’s play another game

  
“The Maverick Game”

  
On the edge of your industries 

  
on the edge of every industry 

  
are a population of maverick companies

  
that are taking a bet against
the incumbents’ business model

  
and their view of the future

  
Actually they have no choice

  
because to be a miniature version
of the incumbent would not be viable

  
Now it’s easy not to notice them 

  
many of them are small companies

  
It's easy to deliberately overlook
them with some justification

  
Many startups disappear fairly quickly
after being founded

  
And it’s very very tempting

  
given all of your experience
in the business

  
to judge them

  
Do they know what they’re doing

  
Does their business model make sense

  
Will they ever make any money

  
But instead of judging them
from the comfort

  
and the confidence of your position

  
try assuming that it’s they that have
the right bet on the future

  
Think about the consequences
of that for your business model

  
Try making the best case for their idea

  
Supposing for example

  
that you are the CEO of a company

  
that makes equipment
that makes semiconductors

  
Naturally you’d probably spend
most of your time and attention

  
on your main customer industry

  
the electronics industry

  
And if it so happened

  
that a couple of maverick
bioscience companies

  
were tinkering with your patents
and your technologies

  
you might overlook that
as a distraction

  
an irrelevance

  
But actually Brooks Automation

  
a leader in the field

  
decided to take a closeup look
at such a group of mavericks

  
to see whether it could learn anything

  
And what it realized

  
by looking at the world
through the eyes of these mavericks

  
was that actually the same techniques

  
and technologies which can be used
to handle delicate semiconductors

  
can also be applied to other fragile
and easily contaminated materials

  
like biological samples

  
And puzzling on the significance of this

  
they reimagined how to handle
and store and transport

  
and label and identify biological samples

  
In fact they became a successful pioneer

  
in the new industry
of automated biobanking

  
So successful in fact
that just a couple of days ago

  
they announced that this was now
their core business moving forwards

  
It’s only by focusing
on these anomalous mavericks

  
that they could see their own path
to renewed success and growth

  
Now not everything in business
goes according to plan

  
In fact sometimes the plans
go horribly awry

  
But you know what

  
That can be a source of inspiration too

  
To find out how

  
let’s play the “PreMortem Game”

  
So your role in this game is to write 

  
the obituary for your company

  
which is going to fail
with  percent certainty

  
in five years’ time

  
What is the cause of death

  
What will have been the point of failure

  
Why will it have failed

  
How will it have failed

  
The challenge here is that it’s easy
to be seduced into the baseline fallacy

  
The baseline fallacy is the idea

  
that it’s the current business model
which is the lowrisk bet

  
And of course that tends to be true

  
until it isn’t true

  
at which point it’s probably too late
to do anything about it

  
Now your employees
are an earlywarning indicator

  
They will have intuitions
if the model begins to slip

  
but it’s very hard for them to speak up

  
And it’s even taboo for them to speak up

  
when the business model is under pressure

  
But when executives create playgrounds 

  
spaces for the safe exploration
of alternatives

  
and alternative scenarios 

  
then you get to tap into your employees’
considerable experience

  
about the vulnerabilities

  
and the weak spots

  
and the blind spots of your company

  
Does anyone remember visiting recently
one of these gorgeous marble palaces

  
No

  
It’s probably been a while since
we visited the local banking branch

  
Had bricksandmortar banks
played the “PreMortem Game”

  
perhaps they would have heard
their employees expressing some concerns

  
about the gradually dwindling
flow of customers to local branches

  
And perhaps they would have been
slightly less taken by surprise

  
when companies like NewBank

  
a digital native

  
seized very rapidly indeed
on that opportunity

  
to convince to date
more than  million Latin Americans

  
that inperson transactions
in real buildings

  
were a quaint but obsolete
relic of the past

  
It’s only when you bring
your vulnerabilities into full view

  
in this way

  
that you may be motivated
to reimagine your business

  
and to do so in a robust manner

  
It’s why the Roman Catholic Church
invented the role

  
the position of the Devil’s advocate
in the th century

  
to test the future consequences
of its decisions to appoint new saints

  
They did that by imagining

  
what would Satan say

  
or propose

  
or counterpropose

  
in addition to the normal procedure
of thinking about the big man upstairs

  
Now any human being
any employee any team

  
and therefore any company
can harness human imagination

  
It’s a defining trait of our species

  
Failures to imagine in business
are really failures of leadership

  
Business is a serious matter
but it should not exclude play

  
When leaders embrace play
and imagination games

  
they can unlock the imagination
of their employees

  
uncover disruptive new strategies

  
and renew their lease on the future

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Imagine a world in which China
was an environmental leader

  
That would be a more
hopeful world wouldn't it

  
When we hear about China

  
we usually hear about human rights
trade disputes toxic pollution

  
And I'm not here to dispute the news

  
Instead what I want to do

  
is share with you evidence
based on personal experience

  
of where China is leading

  
ClientEarth the environmental law
organization that I set up

  
has a person office in Beijing

  
We work as trusted partners
with the Ministry of Environment

  
We train judges and we train prosecutors
in environmental prosecutions

  
Let me share with you how this all began

  
In 

  
I was invited to Brussels to meet
a group of Chinese officials

  
They said they wanted to meet CEOs
of Western environmental groups

  
because they were looking to encourage
more environmental groups in China

  
Shortly after that
I was invited to Beijing

  
by the Supreme People's Court
the highest court in the land

  
The judges were working
on regulations for a new law

  
that would allow
Chinese environmental NGOs

  
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
They were interested in my advice

  
because of my extensive
environmental litigation experience

  
in Europe and in America

  
They wanted to know they said

  
what it would take to really make
such a system work

  
I found myself
in a conference room in Beijing

  
with three justices of the Supreme Court

  
and senior officials
of the Ministry of Environment

  
and the People's Congress
which is the Chinese parliament

  
"Before we get into details" I said
"I want to compliment you

  
It is amazing that you are writing a law

  
to allow Chinese environmental groups
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
This is revolutionary"

  
(Laughter)

  
The senior judge said "Mr Thornton
'revolutionary' is a big word for us"

  
(Laughter)

  
So we laughed

  
And in that human moment
I realized I could work with these people

  
He said "Consider it a sea change"

  
So for the next three months or so

  
my team and I worked
very closely with the judges

  
designing recommendations
for how to make the system really deliver

  
for citizens enforcing the law

  
One of the key provisions
we worked on involved costs

  
Now it costs money to bring
environmental litigation

  
and what really kills you is

  
if when you lose you have to pay
the other side's costs

  
as you do in the UK

  
We said this was only going to work
for the Chinese environmental groups

  
if when they won a case

  
they had all of their costs
paid by the polluters

  
but when they lost they would not
have to pay any of the polluters’ costs

  
Because win or lose

  
they were asserting the interests
of the public at large

  
Three months after that I found myself
back in a meeting in Beijing;

  
this time in the Supreme Court building
just off Tiananmen Square

  
I was there with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
We were sitting at a white marble table
that seemed to be  feet long

  
Across from us were three
Supreme Court judges

  
A senior judge began the meeting

  
by saying that they had accepted
almost all of our recommendations

  
including the key recommendation on costs

  
So at one stroke

  
the Chinese system became friendlier
to citizen environmental groups

  
trying to enforce the law

  
than many countries

  
The senior judge then said
"What do you want to do next for China"

  
Now on my prior trip

  
I had learned that the Chinese
had just appointed

  
 environment court judges

  
Now environment judges specialists
are rare around the world

  
In Europe for example
there's just a handful in Scandinavia

  
Their idea was that by appointing
all of these specialist judges

  
they would hear a vast volume of cases

  
and raise the quality of the rule of law
for the environment in China quickly

  
"So" I said "you might want
to train those judges"

  
They then asked us to train the judges

  
But I had never trained
a judge in my life

  
So I said “Where shall we start”

  
"With us" he said

  
"With the Supreme Court"

  
"Yes"

  
"But what do you want to learn"

  
"Well" he said "we want you to come back

  
and give us a seminar
on climate litigation

  
because you're an expert in that"

  
I said "Gladly but what's the thought
behind your request"

  
And he said

  
“We want to know the best
climate change cases in the world

  
because we want to decide
some of the best climate change cases

  
here in China"

  
Now I can assure you that I had never
had such a conversation

  
with the Supreme Court in Washington 

  
(Laughter)

  
or even London or Paris

  
Certainly nowhere other than Beijing

  
So we teamed up with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
to create a ClientEarth office in Beijing

  
He then organized this training seminar
for the Supreme Court

  
where we discussed trends
in climate litigation around the world

  
He then organized training sessions

  
for all of those specialist
environment court judges

  
Now more such judges have been
appointed in the meantime

  
and as of today

  
we've trained more than 
of these judges

  
(Applause)

  
About a year after we started
training the judges

  
a prosecutor came to our office and said

  
"In that law that you helped write

  
we the prosecutors got the right to sue
the Chinese government

  
on behalf of the people
for environmental matters

  
and we've never had the right
to sue the government before"

  
ClientEarth on the other hand
sues governments all the time

  
(Laughter)

  
So they were asking us
to share with them

  
our experience of suing governments

  
This was the Chinese federal prosecutors
asking us to train them

  
to sue the Chinese government

  
(Laughter)

  
It is the most amazing request
I've ever had

  
(Laughter)

  
So of course we started
working with them

  
We've now trained over  prosecutors
in how to bring environmental cases

  
(Applause)

  
A few months ago (Laughs)

  
we got a letter handdelivered

  
from the prosecutors
to our Beijing office

  
Now what I'm told
by my friends in Beijing

  
ordinarily the last thing
in life you want to get

  
is a letter from the prosecutors

  
This however was a thankyou note

  
and what it said was "Thank you
for your cooperation with us

  
As a result of cooperating with you

  
we have brought in  alone

  
over  environmental cases"

  
Audience Whoa

  
(Applause)

  
 cases and the majority
of those cases

  
were brought against
government departments

  
Now the prosecutors have set up bureaus
all over the country

  
to keep pushing out this level of cases

  
to raise compliance standards
throughout the country

  
Now if this isn't a revolution
it's certainly a sea change

  
(Laughter)

  
Now whenever I talk about China
I'm always asked about coal

  
China burns more coal
than any other country

  
We're working on that

  
Following the money
we've been working for some years

  
with the largest banks
and financial institutions in China

  
The argument we've been making

  
is that coal is simply a bad
investment for them to make

  
Recently we had
a twoday seminar in Beijing

  
for these institutions

  
and it was very heartening to see

  
that that argument
that coal is a bad investment

  
has now been internalized
by these institutions

  
and taken into their own thinking

  
When it comes to enforcement

  
the prosecutors have a new
fantastic opportunity

  
Recently a government audit

  
found that many of the new
coalfired power stations

  
authorized in recent times in China

  
were authorized illegally
by provincial officials

  
who wanted to boost their balance sheet

  
Because these were illegally authorized

  
they are a perfect enforcement target

  
Now another major problem
is all of the coalfired power stations

  
that Chinese companies
have been planning to build

  
outside China in Belt and Road
development countries

  
So we've been working
alongside many others

  
with the Ministry of Environment

  
to try and figure out how you stop
all of those coalfired power stations

  
in the pipeline

  
And what is wonderful news
is that in September 

  
President Xi Jinping
at the UN General Assembly

  
announced that China
would not fund or build

  
any more coalfired
power stations outside China

  
(Applause)

  
We also have reason to believe 
and good reason I think 

  
that China’s own emissions
will hit their peaking plateau soon

  
and then will seriously
decline before 

  
Now does more need to be done in China

  
Certainly  a lot more and faster

  
just like in every other country

  
But what I've found heartening

  
are all of these changes to the system
that they've been making in recent years

  
All of these environment court judges

  
the tens of thousands of cases

  
many of them against
government departments;

  
the Ministry of Environment
getting enhanced powers;

  
the largest banks
and financial institutions

  
realizing that coal is a bad investment;

  
the president promising
no more coal outside China

  
We work in many countries
around the world

  
but I have never seen
the intense focus on systemic change

  
moving a country towards
environmental improvements

  
as I've seen in China

  
I'd like to think that I have
given you reasons for hope

  
China has certainly given me hope

  
Thank you

  
(Cheers and applause)

  
I’d like to dedicate this talk
to my three children

  
Phi Mack

  
and Ella Roberta

  
(Inhales)

  
If I stop breathing for two minutes

  
I would die

  
It is the simplest thing
that all of us do unconsciously

  
about  times a day

  
So normal

  
that we forget that breathing
is the essence of life

  
My daughter Ella Roberta

  
stopped breathing frequently

  
and was resuscitated
numerous times by me at home

  
and in hospital by her doctors

  
until suddenly on the th of February

  
three weeks after her ninth birthday

  
she took her final breath

  
Ella was a healthy clever
sporty and funny girl

  
She had a lot of musical ability

  
At the time of her passing

  
she already played a dozen instruments

  
She was exceptionally good at football

  
cycling skating swimming and dancing

  
Ella was a great writer

  
and she was also pretty good at art

  
At the time of her passing

  
she had a reading age of  years

  
When she was six

  
the simple act of breathing
became the biggest challenge of her life

  
I rushed Ella to hospital
 times in  months

  
when she suddenly began suffering
severe respiratory issues

  
She was diagnosed
with lifethreatening asthma

  
at the age of seven

  
She was admitted
into intensive care five times

  
and put in an induced coma
to save her life

  
when her lungs gave up on her

  
It wasn't until after
the first coroner's inquest

  
in September 

  
that I learned that her possible trigger
of her sudden illness

  
was to do with "something in the air"

  
But at that time
we did not know what it was

  
Ella had one of the worst
cases ever of asthma

  
recorded in the United Kingdom

  
according to the pathologist
who carried out her postmortem

  
We as a family we live  meters
from the South Circular

  
in southeast London

  
It is one of the busiest roads in the UK

  
I later learned that air
pollution around our home

  
was persistently far above the levels
deemed acceptable by the WHO

  
On every walk to school every bike ride

  
every time Ella went outside

  
her body was absorbing
invisible toxic air

  
spewed out by petrol and diesel vehicles

  
A second inquest into Ella’s death
just in December 

  
the coroner Philip Barlow

  
he concluded that it was the excessive
illegal levels of air pollution

  
not only inducted her asthma

  
but it was the highest ever
on the night she died

  
As a result of this

  
Ella is the first person in the world

  
to have air pollution
listed as a cause of death

  
on her death certificate

  
Ella's story is unique I admit

  
but her experience is shockingly ordinary

  
In too many countries around the world

  
air pollution exceeds

  
what the WHO tells us
is acceptable to breathe

  
Fossil fuels everyone
they're killing us

  
Almost one in five premature deaths

  
are linked to air pollution

  
from combustion engines
coal power plants

  
wood burning ammonia cooking stoves

  
and other fossil fuels

  
That is  million people a year
dying from heart attacks cancer strokes

  
dementia suicide depression
stillbirths and miscarriages

  
And that's just the start

  
Children are the worst affected
due to their lungs still developing

  
Air pollution stunts the development
of lungs and brains

  
Scientists believe it
are finding soot in mothers placentas

  
meaning unborn babies
are directly exposed to the black carbon

  
produced by motor traffic
and fuel burning

  
Like Ella  percent of children
around the world

  
are breathing unsafe air

  
The real tragedy of this is we know
how to solve this public health crisis

  
We need to shift from toxic fossil fuels

  
to clean electrified public
and active transport

  
The second inquest into Ella’s death
made it abundantly clear

  
Ella would still be here alive today

  
if air pollution around our home

  
had been within the WHO acceptable limits

  
Air pollution is an invisible
global pandemic

  
It's a silent killer

  
You know what
unless you clean up the air

  
you will never resolve climate change

  
Do you know why

  
It's linked to global warming

  
acid rain

  
effects on wildlife

  
depletion of the ozone layer

  
But for me this is personal

  
Eight years after Ella's death

  
I still visit respiratory doctors
with Ella’s siblings

  
who continue to be impacted
by excessive air pollution

  
As my children and I share a genetic link

  
we are equally susceptible
to air pollution

  
The WHO recently
strengthened its guidelines

  
and the evidence shows us
there is no such thing as safe levels

  
Every country in the world

  
must enshrine these new
WHO guidelines into law now

  
I'm putting them on notice

  
(Applause)

  
What do I want

  
I'll tell you what I want

  
I want every government
to guarantee their children

  
the chance to live full and healthy lives

  
To be able to fully and safely breathe

  
Breathing clean air
is every child's human right

  
Governments have a duty of care
to protect their citizens

  
Remember  million people
in the world have asthma

  
including me

  
(Breathing through inhaler)

  
The fight to breathe clean air is real

  
When I say "Breathe life"

  
what do you say

  
You say "Clean air is our right!"

  
Breathe life!

  
Audience Clean air is our right!

  
RAKD Thank you for listening

  
Thank you very much

  
(Applause and cheers)

Bruno Giussani We are at the end
of day six of the war in Ukraine

  
or more correctly
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
launched on February 
by President Vladimir Putin

  
We are all shocked
and saddened by the events

  
and by the human suffering
they are causing

  
And as we speak really

  
a Russian military convoy
is headed towards Kyiv

  
other Ukrainian cities
are being bombarded

  
half a million Ukrainians have already
fled to neighboring countries

  
and much more

  
It's still early days

  
and it's difficult to predict
how the situation will evolve

  
even just in the next few hours

  
But this is a war that should concern
everyone everywhere

  
And so today in this TED
Membership conversation

  
we want to try to give it
a broader context with our guest

  
historian and author Yuval Noah Harari

  
Yuval welcome

  
Yuval Noah Harari Hello

  
Thank you for inviting me

  
BG I want to start from Ukraine itself
and its  million people

  
and its particular place
between the East and the West

  
What do we need to know about Ukraine

  
to understand this war
and what's at stake

  
YNH The most crucial thing to know
is that Ukrainians are not Russians

  
and that Ukraine is an ancient
independent nation

  
Ukraine has a history
of more than a thousand years

  
Kyiv was a major metropolis
and cultural center

  
when Moscow was not even a village

  
For most of these thousand years
Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow

  
They were not part
of the same political entity

  
For centuries Kyiv was looking westwards

  
and was a part of a union
with Lithuania and Poland

  
until it was eventually conquered
and absorbed by the Russian Empire

  
by the czarist empire

  
But even after that

  
Ukrainians remained
a separate people to a large extent

  
and it's important to know that

  
because this is really
what is at stake in this war

  
The key issue of the war

  
at least for President Putin

  
is whether Ukraine
is an independent nation

  
whether it is a nation at all

  
He has this fantasy
that Ukraine isn't a nation

  
that Ukraine is just a part of Russia

  
that Ukrainians are Russians

  
In his fantasy

  
Ukrainians are Russians that want
to be back in the fold of Mother Russia

  
and that the only ones preventing it
is a very small gang at the top

  
which he portrays as Nazis

  
even if the president is Jewish;
but OK a Nazi Jew

  
And his belief was at least

  
that he just needs to invade

  
Zelenskyy will flee

  
the government will collapse

  
the army would lay down its arms

  
and the Ukrainian people
would welcome the Russian liberators

  
throwing flowers on them

  
And this fantasy
has been shattered already

  
Zelenskyy hasn’t fled

  
the Ukrainian army is fighting

  
And the Ukrainian people is not throwing
flowers on the Russian tanks

  
it's throwing Molotov cocktails

  
BG So let's unpack that

  
and maybe take the different
pieces one way one

  
So Ukraine has a long history
of being dominated and occupied

  
You mentioned the czar
but also the Soviet Union

  
Hitler's armies

  
It also has a long history of mistrust
of authority and of resistance

  
which goes some way to explain
the current strong resistance

  
that the Russians are encountering

  
Anne Applebaum the journalist
even suggests that this mistrust

  
this resistance to authority

  
is the very essence
of Ukraineness do you agree

  
YNH We did see in the last  years
Ukrainians twice rising in revolt

  
when there was a danger

  
of an authoritarian regime
being established 

  
once in  once in 

  
And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago

  
what really struck me
was this very strong feeling

  
of the desire for independence
and for democracy

  
And I remember walking around this museum

  
of the Revolution of 

  
and seeing these images
like these two elderly women

  
who were bringing sandwiches
to the demonstrators

  
to the fighters

  
They couldn’t throw stones
and they couldn’t do anything else

  
so they prepared sandwiches

  
and brought this huge tray
full of sandwiches

  
to the demonstrators

  
And this yes this is the kind of spirit

  
that inspires not just the Ukrainians

  
but everybody who is now watching
what is happening there

  
BG Help me understand
the actual nature of the threat here

  
in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine

  
So in your last book
when you write about Russia

  
you describe the Russian model as
“not a coherent political ideology

  
but rather a sort of practice
of monopolizing power and wealth

  
by a small group at the top"

  
But then in his actions against Ukraine

  
Putin in the last few weeks seems to move
very much by an ideology

  
an ideology of empire
of denial of Ukraine's right to exist

  
as you mention

  
What has changed in the four years
since you wrote that book

  
YNH The imperial dream was always there

  
but you know empires
are often the creation

  
of a very small gang of people at the top

  
I don’t think the Russian people
[are] interested in this war

  
I don't think that the Russian people
want to conquer Ukraine

  
or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv

  
It's all coming from the top

  
So there is no change there

  
I mean when you look at the Soviet Union

  
you can say that there was
this mass ideology

  
which was shared by a large proportion
or some proportion of the population

  
You don't see this now

  
You know Russia is a very rich country

  
rich in resources

  
but most people are very poor

  
Their standard of living is very very low

  
because all the wealth and power
is kind of sucked

  
by the people at the top

  
and very little is left
for everybody else

  
So I don't think it's a society

  
where the masses are part
of this kind of ideological project

  
They're being ruled from the top

  
And you have this classic
imperial situation

  
when the emperor

  
which controls the largest
country in the world

  
feels that "Hey this is not enough

  
I need more"

  
And sends his army to capture

  
to extend the empire

  
BG I said at the beginning

  
that it's difficult of course
to make predictions

  
But yesterday you published
an article in "The Guardian"

  
titled “Why Putin
has already lost this war”

  
Please explain

  
YNH Well one thing should be very clear

  
I don't mean to say

  
that he's going to suffer
an immediate military defeat

  
He definitely has the military
power to conquer Kyiv

  
and perhaps the whole of Ukraine

  
Unfortunately we might see this

  
But his longterm goal

  
the whole rationale of the war

  
is to deny the existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
and to absorb it into Russia

  
And to do that it's not enough
to conquer Ukraine

  
You also need to hold it

  
And it's all based
on this fantasy on this gamble

  
that most of the population
in Ukraine would agree to this

  
would even welcome this

  
And we already know that it's not true

  
That the Ukrainians
are a very real nation;

  
they are fiercely independent;

  
they don’t want to be part of Russia;

  
they will fight like hell

  
And in the longrun again
you can conquer a country

  
But as the Russians learned
in Afghanistan

  
as the Americans learned
also in Afghanistan also in Iraq

  
it's much harder to hold a country

  
And again the big question mark
before the war was always this

  
Before the war started
many things were already known

  
Everybody knew that the Russian army
is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army

  
Everybody knew that NATO will not send
armed forces into Ukraine

  
troops into Ukraine

  
Everybody knew that the West
the Europeans would be hesitant

  
about imposing too strict
a sanction regime

  
for fear of being hurt by it themselves

  
And this was the basis
for Putin's war plan

  
But there was one big unknown

  
Nobody could say for sure
how the Ukrainian people would react

  
And there was always the option

  
that maybe Putin's fantasy
would come true

  
Maybe the Russians will march in

  
Zelenskyy would flee

  
maybe the Ukrainian army
will just capitulate

  
and the population would not do much

  
This was always an option

  
And now we know this was just fantasy

  
Now we know that the Ukrainians
are fighting they will fight

  
And this derails the whole
rationale of Putin’s war

  
Because you can conquer
the country maybe

  
but you won't be able to absorb
Ukraine back into Russia

  
The only thing he's accomplishing

  
he is planting seeds of hatred

  
in the hearts of every Ukrainian

  
Every Ukrainian being killed

  
every day this war continues
is more seeds of hatred

  
that may last for generations

  
Ukrainians and Russians
didn't hate each other before Putin

  
They’re siblings

  
Now he's making them enemies

  
And if he continues
this will be his legacy

  
BG We're going to talk a bit
about that again later but you know

  
at the same time
Putin needs a victory right

  
The cost the human economic
political cost of this war

  
not even a week in
is already astronomical

  
So to justify it and also
to remain by the way

  
a viable leader at the head of Russia

  
Putin needs to win
and even win convincingly

  
So how do we square these things

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean the fact that you need to win
doesn't mean that you can win

  
Lots of political leaders need to win
and sometimes they lose

  
He could stop the war
declare that he won

  
and say that recognizing
Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians

  
is what he really wanted all along
and he achieved this

  
Maybe they cobble this agreement
or I don’t know

  
This is the job of politicians
I'm not a politician

  
But I can tell you that I hope
for the sake of everybody 

  
Ukrainians Russians
and the whole of humanity 

  
that this war stops immediately

  
Because if it doesn't

  
it's not only the Ukrainians
and the Russians

  
that will suffer terribly

  
Everybody will suffer terribly
if this war continues

  
BG Explain why

  
YNH Because of the shock waves
destabilizing the whole world

  
Let’s start with the bottom line

  
budgets

  
We have been living in an amazing era
of peace in the last few decades

  
And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy

  
You saw it in the bottom line

  
You saw it in the budgets

  
In Europe in the European Union

  
the average defense budget of EU members

  
was around three percent
of government budget

  
And that's a historical miracle almost

  
For most of history

  
the budget of kings and emperors
and sultans like  percent

  
 percent goes to war goes to the army

  
In Europe it’s just three percent

  
In the whole world the average
is about six percent I think

  
factcheck me on this
but this is the figure that I know

  
six percent

  
What we saw already within a few days

  
Germany doubles
its military budget in a day

  
And I'm not against it

  
Given what they are facing
it's reasonable

  
For the Germans for the Poles

  
for all of Europe to double their budgets

  
And you see other countries
around the world doing the same thing

  
But this is you know
a race to the bottom

  
When they double their budgets

  
other countries look and feel insecure
and double their budgets

  
so they have to double
them again and triple them

  
And the money that should go
to health care

  
that should go to education

  
that should go to fight climate change

  
this money will now go to tanks
to missiles to fighting wars

  
So there is less
health care for everybody

  
and there is maybe no solution
to climate change

  
because the money goes to tanks

  
And in this way
even if you live in Australia

  
even if you live in Brazil

  
you will feel the repercussions
of this war in less health care

  
in a deteriorating ecological crisis

  
in many other things

  
Again another very central
question is technology

  
We are on the verge
we are already in the middle actually

  
of new technological arms races
in fields like artificial intelligence

  
And we need global agreement
about how to regulate AI

  
and to prevent the worst scenarios

  
How can we get a global agreement on AI

  
when you have a new cold war
a new hot war

  
So in this field to all hopes

  
of stopping the AI arms race
will go up in smoke if this war continues

  
So again everybody around the world
will feel the consequences in many ways

  
This is much much bigger
than just another regional conflict

  
BG If one of Putin's goals here
is to divide Europe

  
to weaken the transatlantic alliance

  
and the global liberal order

  
he seems to kind of accidentally
have revitalized all of them in a way

  
USEU relations have never been
so close in many years

  
And so how do you read that

  
YNH Well again in this sense
he also lost the war

  
If his aim was to divide
Europe to divide NATO

  
he's achieved exactly the opposite

  
I mean I was amazed by how quick

  
how strong and how unanimous
the European reaction was

  
I think the Europeans
surprised themselves

  
You even see countries like Finland
and Sweden sending arms to Ukraine

  
and closing their airspace

  
They didn't even do it in the Cold War

  
It's really amazing to see it

  
I think another very important thing
is what has been dividing the West

  
over the several years now

  
it’s what people term the “culture war”

  
The culture war between left and right
between conservatives and liberals

  
And I think this war can be an opportunity

  
to end the culture war within the West

  
to make peace in the culture war

  
First of all because you suddenly realize
we are all in this together

  
There are much bigger things in the world

  
than these arguments
between left and right

  
within the Western democracies

  
And it's a reminder
that we need to stand united

  
to protect Western liberal democracies

  
But it's deeper than that

  
Much of the argument
between left and right

  
seemed to be in terms of a contradiction

  
between liberalism and nationalism

  
Like you need to choose

  
And the right goes with nationalism

  
and the left goes more liberalism

  
And Ukraine is a reminder that no
the two actually go together

  
Historically nationalism
and liberalism are not opposites

  
They are not enemies

  
They are friends they go together

  
They meet around the central value
of freedom of liberty

  
And to see a nation fighting
for its survival

  
fighting for its freedom

  
you see it on Fox News
or you see it in CNN

  
And yes they tell the story
a little differently

  
but they suddenly see the same reality

  
And they find common ground

  
And the common ground is to understand

  
that nationalism is not about hating
minorities or hating foreigners

  
it's about loving your compatriots

  
and reaching a peaceful agreement

  
about how we want
to run our country together

  
And I hope that seeing what is happening

  
would help to end
the culture war in the West

  
And if this happens we don't need
to worry about anything

  
You know when you look
at the real power balance

  
if the Europeans stick together

  
if the Americans and
the Europeans stick together

  
and stop this culture war
and stop tearing themselves apart

  
they have absolutely nothing to fear 
the Russians or anybody else

  
BG I'm going to ask you a question later
about the stories the West tells itself

  
but let me zoom out for a second
and get a larger perspective

  
You wrote another essay
last week in “The Economist”

  
and you argue that what's at stake
in Ukraine is and I quote you

  
"the direction of human history"

  
because it puts at risk what you call

  
the greatest political and moral
achievement of modern civilization

  
which is the decline of war

  
So now we are back in a war
and potentially afterwards

  
into a new form of cold war or hot war

  
but hopefully not

  
Elaborate about that essay you wrote

  
YNH Yeah I mean some people think

  
that all this talk
about the decline of war

  
was always just a fantasy

  
But 

  
Again you look at the statistics

  
Since 

  
there has not been a single clash
between superpowers

  
whereas previously in history

  
this was you know
the basic stuff of history

  
Since 

  
not a single internationally
recognized country

  
was wiped off the map
by external invasion

  
This was the common thing in history

  
Until then and then it stopped

  
This is an amazing achievement

  
which is the basis for everything we have

  
for our medical services

  
for education system

  
and this is all now in jeopardy

  
Because this era of peace

  
it wasn't the result of some miracle

  
It wasn't the result of a change
in the laws of nature

  
It was humans making better decisions
and building better institutions

  
which means also

  
that there is no guarantee for the future

  
If humans some humans
start making bad decisions

  
and start destroying
the institutions that kept the peace

  
then we will be back in the era of war

  
with budgets military budgets
going to    percent

  
It can happen

  
It's in our hands

  
And I'll just say one more thing

  
When not just me but other scholars
like Steven Pinker and others

  
talked about the era of peace

  
some people understood it
as kind of encouraging complacency

  
That oh we don't need
to worry about anything

  
No I mean the message
was really the opposite

  
It was a message of responsibility

  
If you think that there is no
era of peace in history

  
it's always war it's always the jungle

  
there is a constant level
of violence in nature

  
then this basically means

  
that there is no point
struggling for peace

  
and there is no responsibility
on leaders like Putin

  
because you can't blame Putin for the war

  
It's just a law of nature
that there are wars

  
When you realize no humans are able
to decrease the level of violence

  
then it should make us
much more responsible

  
And it should also make us understand

  
that the war in Ukraine now
it’s not a natural disaster

  
It’s a manmade disaster
and a single man

  
It's not the Russian people
who want this war

  
There's really just a single person

  
who by his decisions

  
created this tragedy

  
BG So one of the things
that has come back

  
in the last weeks and months
is the nuclear threat

  
It's moved back into the center
of political and strategic considerations

  
Putin has talked about it several times

  
the other day he ordered Russia's
nuclear forces on a higher alert status

  
President Zelenskyy himself
at the Munich Security Conference

  
essentially said that Ukraine
had made a mistake

  
abandoning the nuclear weapons
it had inherited from the Soviet Union

  
That's a statement that I suspect
many countries are pondering

  
What's your thinking about the return
of the nuclear threat

  
YNH It's extremely frightening

  
You know it's like it's almost Freudian

  
it's the return of the repressed

  
We thought that oh nuclear weapons yes

  
there was something
about that in the s

  
with the Cuban Missile Crisis
and Dr Strangelove

  
But no it's here

  
And you know it took just a few days

  
of difficulties on the battlefield

  
for suddenly 

  
I mean I'm watching
television like the news

  
and you have these experts
explaining to people

  
what different nuclear weapons will do
to this city or to this country

  
It rushed back in

  
So you know nuclear weapons are 

  
in a way they also until now
preserved the peace of the world

  
I belong to the school of thought
that if it was not for nuclear weapons

  
we would have had the Third World War

  
between the Soviet Union
and the United States and NATO

  
sometime in the s or 's

  
That nuclear weapons actually
until today served a good function

  
It's because of nuclear weapons

  
that we did not have any more
direct clashes between superpowers

  
because it was obvious
that this would be collective suicide

  
But the danger is still there
it's always there

  
If there is miscalculation

  
then the results could of course

  
be existential catastrophic

  
BG And at the same time you know
in the 's after Cuba and Berlin

  
and so in the 's but in the 's

  
we started building a sort of
international institutional architecture

  
that helped reduce the risk of military
confrontation of nuclear weapons

  
we used you know anything
from arms control agreements

  
to measures designed to build trust
or to communicate directly and so on

  
And then in the last decade or so

  
that has been progressively
kind of scrapped

  
so we are even in a more
dangerous situation

  
than we were let's say
at the end of the last century

  
YNH Completely I mean

  
we are now reaping
the bad fruits of neglect

  
that's been going on for several years

  
not just about nuclear
weapons but in general

  
about international institutions
and global cooperation

  
We’ve built in the late th century

  
a house for humanity

  
based on cooperation

  
based on collaboration

  
based on the understanding

  
that our future depends
on being able to cooperate

  
otherwise we will become
extinct as a species

  
And we all live in this house

  
But in the last few years we stopped 

  
we neglected it we stopped repairing it

  
We allow it to deteriorate more and more

  
And you know eventually it will 

  
It is collapsing now

  
So I hope that people will realize
before it's too late

  
that we need not just
to stop this terrible war

  
we need to rebuild the institutions

  
we need to repair the global house
in which we all live together

  
If it falls down we all die

  
BG So we have
among the audience listening

  
Rola from 

  
I don't know where she's from
she grew up in Lebanon 

  
and she said "I lived the war
I slept on the ground I breathed fear

  
All the reasons were explained to me
that the only remaining learning came

  
the war is absurd

  
We talk about strategy power budgets
opportunities technologies

  
What about human suffering
and psychological trauma"

  
Especially I assume what she's asking
is what about what's going to remain

  
in terms of the human suffering

  
and the psychological trauma
going forward

  
YNH Yeah I mean
these are the seeds of hatred

  
and fear and misery

  
that are being planted right now
in the minds and the bodies

  
of tens of millions
hundreds of millions of people really

  
Because it's not just
the people in Ukraine

  
it's also in the countries around
all over the world

  
And these seeds will give
a terrible harvest

  
terrible fruits in years
in decades to come

  
This is why it's so crucial
to stop the war immediately

  
Every day this continues
plants more and more of these seeds

  
And you know like this war now

  
its seeds were to a large extent

  
planted decades and even centuries ago

  
That part of the Russian fears
that are motivating Putin

  
and motivating people around him

  
is memories of past invasions of Russia

  
especially of course
in Second World War

  
And of course it's a terrible mistake

  
what they are doing with it

  
They are recreating again the same things
that they should learn to avoid

  
But yes these are still
the terrible fruits

  
of the seeds being planted in the s

  
BG It's what in same article you call

  
the fact that nations
are ultimately built on stories

  
So these seeds are the stories
we are starting to create now

  
The war in Ukraine
is starting to create the stories

  
that are going to have an impact
in the future that's what you're saying

  
YNH Some of the seeds of this war
were planted in the siege of Leningrad

  
And now it gives fruit
in the siege of Kyiv

  
which may give fruit
in  or  years in more terrible 

  
We need to cut this we need to stop this

  
You know as a historian

  
I feel sometimes ashamed
or responsible I don't know what

  
about what history the knowledge
of history is doing to people

  
In recent weeks I have been watching
all the world leaders talking with Putin

  
and very often he gave them
lectures on history

  
I think that Macron had a discussion
with him for five hours

  
and afterwards said “Most of the time
he was lecturing me about history”

  
And as a historian I feel ashamed

  
that this is what my profession
in some way is doing

  
I know it for my own country

  
In Israel we also suffer
from too much history

  
I think people should be
liberated from the past

  
not constantly repeating
it again and again

  
You know everybody should
kind of free themselves

  
from the memories of the Second World War

  
It's true of the Russians

  
it's also true of the Germans

  
You know I look at Germany now

  
and what I really want to say
if there are Germans watching us

  
what I really want to say to the Germans

  
guys we know you are not Nazis

  
You don't need to keep
proving it again and again

  
What we need from Germany now
is to stand up and be a leader

  
to be at the forefront
of the struggle for freedom

  
And sometimes Germans are afraid
that if they speak forcefully

  
or pick up a gun

  
everybody will say
"Hey you're Nazis again"

  
No we won't think that

  
BG That's happening right now

  
I mean lots of things that were
inconceivable just  days ago

  
have happened in the last few weeks

  
And one of the most striking
to me in any case

  
is Germany's reaction and transformation

  
I mean the new chancellor
Olaf Scholz the other day announced

  
that Germany will send arms to Ukraine

  
and will spend an extra  billion
dollars in building up its army

  
That reverses completely the principles

  
that have guided Germany's foreign policy

  
and security politics for decades

  
So that shift is happening exactly
at this moment and very very fast

  
YNH Yeah

  
And I think it's a good thing

  
We need the Germans to 

  
I mean they are now
the leaders of Europe

  
certainly after Britain left in Brexit

  
And we need them to in a way

  
let go of the past and be in the present

  
If there is really
one country in the world

  
that as a Jew as an Israeli
as a historian

  
that I trust it not to repeat
the horrors of Nazism

  
that's Germany

  
BG Yuval I want to touch
quickly on three things

  
that have to do with the fact
that this feels like

  
the first truly interconnected
war in many ways

  
The first of course is the basics

  
which is on one side
you have a very ancient war 

  
we have tanks and we have trenches
and we have bombed buildings 

  
and on the other we have
realtime visibility of everything

  
through cell phones and Twitter
and TikTok and so on

  
And you have written a lot
about this tension

  
between old ways and new tech

  
What's the impact here

  
YNH First of all we don't know
everything that is happening

  
I mean surprisingly with all this
TikTok and phones and everything

  
so much is not known

  
So the fog of war is still there and yes

  
there is much more information
but information isn’t truth

  
Lots of information is disinformation
and fake news and so forth

  
And yes it’s always like this;

  
the new and the old they come together

  
You know with all the talk
about interconnectedness

  
and living in cyberspace and all that

  
one of the most important technologies
not just of this war

  
but of the last decade or two
have been stone walls

  
It's Neolithic

  
Everybody is now building stone walls

  
in the era of Facebook
and Google and all that

  
So the old and the new they go together

  
And it's 

  
It is a new kind of war

  
People are sitting at home
in California or Australia

  
and they actively participate in the war

  
not just by writing tweets

  
but by attacking websites
or defending websites

  
You know in Spain in the Civil War

  
if you wanted to help fight fascism

  
then you had to go to Spain
and join the international brigade

  
Now the international brigade
is sitting at home in San Francisco

  
and is still in some way part of the war

  
So this is definitely new

  
BG So indeed just two days ago
Ukraine's deputy prime minister I think

  
Fedorov announced via Telegram

  
that he wanted to create
a sort of volunteer cyber army

  
He invited software developers and hackers

  
and other people with IT skills

  
to somehow help Ukraine
fight on the cyber front

  
And according to “Wired” magazine
in less than two days

  
 people signed up

  
So here is a defending nation
that can kind of recruit almost overnight

  
 volunteers
to go to battle on his behalf

  
It's a very different kind of war

  
YNH Yeah

  
You know every war brings it surprises

  
Sometimes it's how everything is new

  
but sometimes it's also
how everything is old

  
BG So a few people in the chat
and in the Q and A have mentioned China

  
which of course
is an important actor here

  
although for now is mostly an observer

  
But China has a stated policy
of opposing any act

  
that violates territorial integrity

  
So moving into Ukraine of course
violates territorial integrity

  
And it also has a huge interest
in a stable global economy

  
and global system

  
But then it needs to square this
with the recent closeness with Russia

  
Xi Jinping and Putin met in Beijing
before the Olympics for example

  
and kind of had this message of friendship
that went out to the world

  
How do you read China's position
in this conflict

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean I'm not an expert on China

  
and I certainly can't just 

  
You know just reading the news
won't get you into the mindset

  
into the real opinions and positions
of the Chinese leadership

  
I hope that they take
a responsible position

  
And act 

  
because they are close to Russia

  
they are also close to Ukraine

  
but especially because
they are close to Russia

  
they have a lot of influence on Russia

  
I hope that they will be
the responsible adults

  
that will put down the flames of this war

  
They have a lot to lose

  
from a breakdown of the global order

  
And I think they have a lot to win
from the return of peace

  
including in terms of the gratitude
of the international community

  
Now whether they do it or not
this is with them

  
I can't predict but I hope so

  
BG You have mentioned before
the several European and Western leaders

  
that have gone to Moscow
in the weeks before the invasion

  
Varun in the chat asks

  
"Is the Ukraine war
a failure of diplomacy"

  
Could have 

  
Something different happened

  
YNH Oh you can understand it
in two questions

  
Did diplomacy fail to stop the war

  
Absolutely everybody knows that

  
But is it a failure in the sense
that a different diplomatic approach

  
some kind of other proposition
would have stopped the war

  
I don't know but it doesn't seem like it

  
I mean looking at the events
of the last few weeks

  
it doesn't seem that Putin
was really interested

  
in a diplomatic solution

  
It seemed that he was really
interested in the war

  
and I think again
it goes back to this basic fantasy

  
that if he really was concerned
about the security situation of Russia

  
then there was no need
to immediately invade Ukraine

  
There was no immediate threat to Russia

  
There was no discussion of right now
Ukraine joining NATO

  
There was no invasion army assembling
in the Baltic states or in Poland

  
Nothing

  
Putin chose the moment
to start this crisis

  
So this is why it doesn't seem

  
that it's really
about the security concerns

  
It seems more about this very deep fantasy

  
of reestablishing the Russian Empire

  
and of denying the very existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
BG So you live in the Middle East

  
Someone else in the chat asks

  
"What makes the situation so unique

  
compared to many other wars
that are going on right now in the world"

  
I would say aside from the nuclear
threat from Russia but what else

  
YNH Several things

  
First of all

  
we have here again something
we haven't seen since 

  
which is a dominant power

  
trying to basically
obliterate from the map

  
an independent country

  
You know when the US invaded Afghanistan

  
or when the US invaded Iraq

  
you can say a lot of things about it

  
and criticize it in many ways

  
There was no question
of the US annexing Iraq

  
or turning Iraq into the st state
of the United States

  
This is what is happening in Ukraine

  
under this pretext or this disguise

  
this is what's at stake

  
The real aim is to annex Ukraine

  
If this succeeds

  
again it brings us back
to the era of war

  
I was struck by what
the Kenyan representative

  
to the UN Security Council said
when this erupted

  
The Kenyan representative spoke
in the name of Kenya

  
and other African countries

  
And he told the Russians

  
Look we also are the product
of a postimperial order

  
The same way the Soviet empire collapsed
into different independent nations

  
also African nations came out
of the collapse of European empires

  
And the basic principle
of African politics ever since then

  
was that no matter what your objections

  
to the borders you have inherited

  
keep the borders

  
The borders are sacred

  
because if we start invading
neighboring countries because

  
"Hey this is part of our countries

  
these people are part of our nation"

  
there will not be an end to it

  
And if this now happens in Ukraine

  
it will be a blueprint for copycats
all over the world

  
The other thing which is different
is that we are talking about superpowers

  
This is not a war
between Israel and Hezbollah

  
This is potentially a war
between Russia and NATO

  
And even leaving aside nuclear weapons

  
this completely destabilizes
the peace of the entire world

  
And again I go back again
and again to the budgets

  
That if Germany doubles
its defense budget

  
if Poland doubles its defense budget

  
this will spread to every
country in the world

  
and this is terrible news

  
BG So Yuval I'm jumping
from topic to topic

  
because I want to use the last few minutes

  
to ask a few questions from the audience

  
A few people are asking
about the link to the climate crisis

  
particularly when it relates
to the energy flows

  
Like Europe is very dependent

  
part of Europe is very dependent
on Russian oil and gas

  
which is as far as we know
still flowing until today

  
But could this crisis
in a sort of paradoxical way

  
a bit like the pandemic
accelerate climate action

  
accelerate renewables and and so on

  
YNH This is the hope

  
That Europe now realizes the danger

  
and starts a green Manhattan Project

  
that kind of accelerates
what already has been happening

  
but accelerates it

  
the development of better energy sources

  
better energy infrastructure

  
which would release it
from its dependence on oil and gas

  
And it will actually undercut
the dependence of the whole world

  
on oil and gas

  
And this would be the best way
to undermine the Putin regime

  
and the Putin war machine

  
because this is what Russia has

  
oil and gas

  
That's it

  
When was the last time you bought
anything made in Russia

  
They have oil and gas

  
and we know you know the curse of oil

  
That oil is a source of riches

  
but it’s also very often
a support for dictatorships

  
Because to enjoy the benefits of oil

  
you don't need to share it
with your citizens

  
You don't need an open society

  
you don't need education
you just need to drill

  
So we see in many places

  
that oil and gas are actually
the basis for dictatorships

  
If oil and gas if the price drops

  
if they become irrelevant

  
it will not only undercut the finance

  
the power of the Russian military machine

  
it will also force Russia

  
force Putin or the Russians
to change their regime

  
BG OK let me bring up a character

  
that everybody here in the chat
seems to find quite heroic

  
and that's the Ukrainian president

  
So Ukraine kind of finds itself

  
with a comedian who turned
almost accidental president

  
who turned now war president

  
But he has shown an impressive conduct
in the last few weeks

  
especially in the last few days

  
which can be summarized
in that response he gave to the US

  
when they offered
to kind of exfiltrate him

  
so he could lead a government in exile

  
he said "I need ammunition
I don't need a ride"

  
How would you look at President Zelenskyy

  
YNH His conduct
has indeed been admirable

  
and he gives courage and inspiration
not just to the Ukrainian people

  
but I think to everybody around the world

  
I think to a large extent

  
the swift and united reaction of Europe

  
with the sanctions
and sending arms and so forth

  
to a large extent this is also
to the credit of Zelenskyy

  
That you know

  
when politicians are also human beings

  
And his direct appeal to them

  
and you know they met him
many times in person

  
and to see where he is now

  
and the threat that not only him
but his family is also in

  
And you know they talk with him

  
and he says and they know
that this may be the last time they speak

  
He may be dead murdered or bombed
in an hour or in a day

  
It really changes something

  
So in this sense I think he made
a huge personal contribution

  
to not just the reaction in Ukraine
but around the world

  
BG So Sam who’s listening
asked this question

  
"Can you provide some historical context

  
for the force and the meaning
of economic and trade sanctions

  
at the level where they are
currently imposed

  
How have previous wouldbe empires
wouldbe aggressors or aggressors

  
been constrained by such
isolations and such sanctions"

  
YNH You know what we need
again to realize about Putin's Russia

  
is that it's not the Soviet Union

  
It's a much smaller and weaker country

  
It's not like in the s

  
that in addition to the Soviet Union

  
you had the entire Soviet bloc around it

  
So it's easier in this sense
to isolate it

  
It's much more vulnerable

  
Again does it mean that sanctions
would work like a miracle

  
and stop the tanks No

  
It takes time

  
But I think that the West is in a position

  
to impact Russia

  
with these kinds of sanctions
and isolation much more

  
than let's say with the Soviet Union

  
And also the Russian people are different

  
The Russian people
don't really want this war

  
even the people in the immediate
circle around Putin

  
You know again

  
I don't know them personally
from what it seems

  
it's that these people they like life

  
They have their yachts
and they have their private airplanes

  
and they have their house in London

  
and they have their chateau in France

  
And they like the good life

  
and they want to keep enjoying it

  
So I think that the sanctions
can be really effective

  
What's the timetable

  
That's ultimately in the hands of Putin

  
BG So Gabriella asks “I remember
the war in former Yugoslavia

  
and the atrocities there

  
Is there any possibility that this war
would escalate into such a situation"

  
I think an extension to that is

  
Is this war kind of stirring
dormant conflicts

  
like in the Balkans for example

  
or in the former Central Asian republic

  
YNH Unfortunately it can get
to that level and even worse

  
If you want an analogy go to Syria

  
You look at what happened in Homs

  
At what happened in Aleppo

  
And this was done by Putin
and his airplanes

  
and his minions in Syria

  
It's the same person behind it

  
And to think that "No no no
this happened in the Middle East

  
It can't happen in Europe"

  
No

  
We could see Kyiv
in the same situation as Homs

  
as the same situation as Aleppo

  
which would be catastrophic

  
and again would plant
terrible seeds of hatred

  
for years and decades

  
So far we've seen
hundreds of people being killed

  
Ukrainian citizens being killed

  
It could reach tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands

  
So in this sense it's extremely
painful to contemplate

  
And this is why we need again and again

  
to urge the leaders to stop this war

  
and especially again and again

  
tell Putin

  
"You will not be able
to absorb Ukraine into Russia

  
They don't want it they don't want you

  
If you continue

  
the only thing you will achieve
is to create terrible hatred

  
between Ukrainians and Russians
for generations

  
It doesn't have to be like that"

  
BG Yuval let me finish
with one question about your county

  
You are in Israel

  
Israel has close ties
with both Russia and Ukraine

  
It's actually home of many Russianborn
and many Ukrainianborn Jews

  
How is the country reacting
to this conflict

  
I'm talking about the government
but also about the population

  
YNH Actually I'm not
the best person to ask

  
I've been so kind of following
what's happening around the world

  
I didn't pay so much attention
to what is happening right here

  
And even though I live here

  
I'm not an expert on Israeli society
or Israeli politics

  
Definitely the sentiment in the street
in the social media is with Ukraine

  
You see Ukrainian flags

  
you see on social media
people putting Ukrainian flags

  
on their accounts

  
And another thing
so many people in Israel

  
they came from the former Soviet Union

  
And until now

  
everybody was simply known as Russians

  
You know even if you came from Azerbaijan
or you came from Bukhara

  
you were a Russian

  
And suddenly "No no no no no

  
I'm not Russian

  
I'm Ukrainian"

  
And again these seeds of hatred
that Putin is planting

  
it's reaching also here

  
That suddenly people are saying
no Russian Ukrainian

  
until a very short time ago
it's the same thing

  
No it's not the same thing

  
So the shock waves are spreading

  
BG Yuval thank you for taking the time
and being with us today

  
and sharing your knowledge
and your views on the situation

  
Thank you very much

  
YNH Thank you
and I hope for peace quickly

  
BG We all do Thank you

Bruno Giussani It's difficult
to think clearly

  
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
because wars while they unfold

  
they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog

  
Information is abundant

  
the millions of refugees

  
the shocking suffering
and the destruction the politics

  
But sense is lacking

  
And that's going to be the focus
of this Membership conversation

  
as we enter the third week of the war

  
We won’t talk about the events of the day

  
but try to project a longer arc
a broader context

  
Our guest is geopolitical
analyst Ian Bremmer

  
He's the founder
and president of Eurasia Group

  
and we asked him to lay the scene

  
by talking first
about the geopolitical shifts

  
that have already been brought
by the war in Ukraine

  
And after we're going to have
a conversation

  
including questions from TED Members
who are participating in this call

  
Ian welcome

  
Ian Bremmer Thank you very much

  
I'll start by saying that in my lifetime

  
the most important geopolitical artifact
is the fall of the Berlin Wall

  
I mean you see it

  
if you go into the new
NATO headquarters in Brussels

  
just built a few years ago

  
And anyone that has a piece
something they're very proud of

  
they know it affected their entire lives

  
I think that in  years' time

  
and I fear that in  years' time

  
if we look back

  
a second most important
geopolitical artifact

  
will be a piece of the rubble
of the Maidan in Kyiv

  
I believe that the war
that we are seeing right now

  
is no more and no less

  
than the end of the peace dividend

  
that we all thought we had

  
when the wall came down in 

  
The idea that the world could focus
more on globalization

  
and goods and services
and people and ideas

  
going faster and faster across borders

  
leading to unprecedented growth
in human development

  
and a global middle class

  
I think that this is a tipping point

  
Won't end globalization

  
but it does end the peace dividend

  
It does mean that the Europeans overnight

  
will and must prioritize
spending on defense policy

  
on national security
coordination on NATO

  
And the speech that was given
by Olaf Scholz

  
the new chancellor two weeks ago

  
in my view the most significant speech
given by a European leader

  
in the postCold War environment

  
precisely because it's now
the postpostCold War environment

  
sending weapons to the Ukrainians

  
committing to over two percent
of GDP spend on defense

  
investing in a new fund
for defense infrastructure

  
But also recognizing that the way

  
that the Germans
and the Europeans as a whole

  
looked at the world
and looked at themselves was

  
unfortunately for all of us outdated

  
A few other points I'd like to raise
just to kick off this conversation

  
One

  
One of the reasons
I'm pretty negative about this

  
and I'm not usually very negative
I'm usually an existential optimist

  
I’m someone that’s just happy
there’s water in the glass

  
But when I look at this conflict
I’m much more concerned

  
And that is because I do not
see a scenario

  
a plausible scenario
in the foreseeable future

  
where Putin emerges from this war

  
in anything less than a radically
weakened position

  
compared to where he was
before he announced the invasion

  
And I believe that both in terms
of his domestic political orientation

  
how stable he is in his own country

  
also of course
Russia's economic position

  
and finally Russia's position
in terms of global security

  
and European security

  
ostensibly the very reason that Putin
began the war to begin with

  
Second big point is that the decoupling
that we are seeing from Europe

  
and the United States with Russia
is in my view permanent

  
And that would be true even if there were
a negotiated settlement

  
and all the Russian troops
were to pull out of Ukraine

  
and we had peace

  
I still think that a lot
of those companies would not come back

  
with Putin in power

  
I'm convinced that the decisions
by the Europeans

  
to ramp up their national security
capabilities will be permanent

  
Permanent deployments coming
in the Baltic states for example

  
forward deployments in Poland
and Bulgaria and Romania

  
And also an unwind of Europe’s
massive energy dependence

  
coal oil and most importantly gas

  
on Russia

  
That does not make Russia a global pariah

  
because you can't be a global pariah

  
if the soontobe most important
economy in the world China

  
is actually your bestie
on the global stage

  
and that indeed continues to be true

  
despite China's efforts
to portray themselves

  
towards Europe at least

  
as more neutral

  
We are going to see the Russians
as a supplicant economically

  
in terms of energy flows

  
financially in terms of transactions

  
and technologically
perhaps most important

  
aligned with China

  
That has big geopolitical
implications longterm

  
Also a lot of other developing
economies like the Indians

  
like the Gulf states like Brazil

  
are also not going to work
with Russia as a pariah

  
They'll continue to engage

  
Are there any silver linings

  
And I think there are a few

  
Of course there is a much greater
renewed purpose and mission of NATO

  
I mean this is an organization
that just a couple of years ago

  
France President Emmanuel Macron
referred to as “braindead”

  
It was increasingly drifting
in terms of its importance

  
The Americans were focusing
much more on Asia the pivot

  
Not today

  
Today NATO is purposeful

  
it's aligned it's consolidated

  
it's going to get more
resources not less

  
That's also true of the European
Union as a whole

  
even when we talk about countries
like Hungary and Poland

  
that have been much less aligned
in terms of rule of law

  
in terms of an independent judiciary

  
much more aligned in terms
of the importance

  
of common values of Europe

  
compared to that of what
we're seeing in Moscow

  
I mentioned the German security
and policy shift

  
The UKEU relationship is much
smoother and more functional

  
than at any point since Brexit
process actually started

  
And even the United States

  
I mean if you watched
the State of the Union

  
for a brief moment in time
five or  minutes

  
when all of the Democrats and Republicans
were standing and applauding together

  
you could be forgiven for believing
that the United States

  
had a functional representative democracy

  
Now I'm not sure how long
this is going to last

  
but at least as of now

  
leaders of the Democratic
and Republican Party

  
see Putin as much more
of a threat an enemy

  
than they do their opponents
across the aisle in domestic politics

  
And two weeks ago that was not true

  
That's significant

  
Final silver lining
and I wish it was more of one

  
but the Chinese

  
as much as they are strategically
aligned with Russia

  
and with the person of President Putin

  
they do not want a second Cold War

  
And they would rather
a negotiated settlement

  
They're not willing to push
very hard for it

  
But they certainly do not see
a radical decoupling of the Russian

  
and potentially the Chinese economy

  
from the rest of the world from Europe

  
from the US from the advanced
industrial democracies

  
as in any way in their interest

  
And ultimately that does create
at least some buffer

  
some guardrail on how much this is likely
to escalate as a conflict going forward

  
BG I want to make a step back
and unpack some of that

  
maybe starting with a question
that relates to your last point

  
and is probably on the mind of many

  
And it is

  
Is there still some real
space for negotiation

  
Is there still a potential relationship
between Russia and Ukraine

  
IB The foreign ministers of Russia
and Ukraine just met recently in Turkey

  
It was as much of a nonevent

  
as the three preceding negotiations
of more junior representatives

  
of their teams on the Belarus border

  
The one thing that has been
accomplished to a small degree

  
has been humanitarian corridors

  
extending out of a number
of Ukrainian cities

  
that are being pounded
by Russian military

  
That's because the Ukrainians are
interested in protecting their civilians

  
and the Russians are interested
in taking a lot of territory

  
without necessarily having to kill
so many Ukrainians

  
that could cause problems
for them internationally

  
as well as domestically inside Russia

  
But that is nowhere close
to a negotiated settlement

  
Now I mean everyone I know

  
that's involved
in the negotiations right now

  
responds that the President Putin himself
is hellbent on taking Kyiv

  
and on removing Zelenskyy from power

  
Now I think and by the way
they're getting quite close

  
to being able to accomplish that
militarily on the ground

  
I think within the next couple of weeks
certainly it looks very likely

  
A couple of points here

  
One there is no reason to put
any stock in anything

  
that the Russians are saying publicly
in terms of their diplomacy

  
They lied to the face
of every world leader

  
about the invasion that they said
they were not going to do into Ukraine

  
And then just today

  
Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov publicly said

  
well the Russians didn't attack Ukraine

  
I mean this is Orwellian stuff right

  
So first of all do not report
on Russian public statements

  
as if they bear any semblance
to reality on the ground

  
Secondarily this looks like a huge
loss for Putin right now

  
He understands it and I think
he would have a hard time

  
even with his control of information
spinning this to his public

  
without removing Zelenskyy

  
without the “deNazification”
as he calls it 

  
which is an obscenity in an environment

  
where the Ukrainian president
is actually Jewish 

  
the disarmament of Ukraine

  
and of course the ability of the Russians

  
to change how they feel about Ukraine
as a threat to the Russian homeland

  
BG What level of support
can we give Ukraine militarily

  
intel economic

  
before Putin considers
taking a strike on a NATO country

  
IB Well it’s interesting the way
you framed that Bruno

  
Because I mean

  
I think that Putin is already considering
strikes on NATO countries

  
I mean there were massive attacks

  
cyberattacks and disinformation attacks

  
by Russia against NATO countries
with reckless abandon

  
over the course of the past years

  
And in fact when President Biden
met with Putin in Geneva back in June

  
it seems like years
and years ago at this point

  
Biden set the agenda

  
Ukraine was largely not discussed

  
but what was discussed was cyberattacks
on critical infrastructure

  
Because you may remember Bruno

  
that meeting came right after
the cyber attacks

  
against the Colonial Pipeline

  
And the Russians after that
indeed pulled back

  
on supporting those attacks
by their criminal cyber syndicates

  
I expect those attacks to restart
in very short order

  
against NATO countries

  
I also believe that the fact that the West
is sending weapons to Ukraine

  
and is providing realtime
intelligence reports

  
on the disposition of Russian troops
on the ground in Ukraine

  
to better allow the Ukrainians
to defend themselves

  
and blow the Russians up

  
that is considered by the Russians
to be an act of war

  
and they will retaliate

  
And how they retaliate is the question

  
I don't think they're going to send
troops into Poland

  
But you know

  
when the Americans under Reagan
were providing that kind of support

  
to the mujahideen

  
to help them defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan

  
the Soviets saw that as an act of war

  
and they engaged in acts of terrorism
against the mujahideen in Pakistan

  
And I absolutely think
that that is on the table

  
in terms of front line
NATO countries especially

  
like Poland like the Baltic states
like Bulgaria Romania

  
Would that be considered
an Article V attack

  
Would that force NATO countries
to strike the Russians back

  
I'm not sure it would

  
Not directly not militarily

  
So I mean I do think that the fact
that the NATO countries see

  
there is some sort of a big red line
between sending troops in for example

  
and doing a nofly zone
because that could cause World War III

  
but everything short of that
is just a proxy war

  
The Russians don't see it that way

  
And that gives the Russians
some advantage tactically

  
in terms of their willingness to escalate

  
BG You're describing a spiral
of escalation here

  
that will touch the globe
and not only Ukraine

  
not only the eastern flank of Europe

  
which means that not only this war
has ripple effects everywhere

  
but this is also starting
a sort of realignment

  
of the global geopolitical
situation and context

  
To me it has been very striking
how Europe and the US

  
have kind of moved very fast
in a cohesive way

  
And it has chosen after years
of prioritizing the economics

  
in their international
and global dealings

  
it's chosen to put politics over markets

  
It has adopted sanctions
that will hurt Russia

  
but will also hurt Western businesses

  
It’s the discussion about decoupling
that you put forward before

  
an active kind of fencing out
of the Russian economy

  
Talk to us about how do you see
this decoupling playing out

  
IB Yeah I mean I do think
that for the Europeans

  
this is a permanent move

  
I mean I've spoken to top leaders
in the German government

  
who tell me that Nord Stream
was a strategic mistake

  
and they understand it

  
Who say that you know

  
Scholz making this speech
from the Social Democratic Party

  
on the center left

  
is the equivalent of Nixon going to China

  
No one else could have made that move

  
But having made it everyone is on board

  
The popularity in Germany

  
even given the massive
economic consequences

  
is extraordinary and is across the board

  
And what they need to do now

  
is ensure that the diversification
of fossil fuels in the near term

  
away from Russia

  
towards Qatar and Azerbaijan
and even you know

  
sort of the United States for LNG

  
can be done as fast as humanly possible

  
And that further even though
it’s going to cost a lot

  
some of it will be uneconomic

  
the move towards renewables
actually picks up and is faster

  
The Italians Mario Draghi

  
I think his shift in strategic
orientation that they will do

  
this is his "whatever it takes" moment

  
He had that in response
to the  financial crisis

  
as the head of the European Central Bank

  
and that made him “Super Mario”

  
This is making him Super Mario
as the Italian prime minister

  
This is the "whatever it takes"
moment for the Italians

  
who never make public statements
that undermine their economic

  
their commercial interests
like this in such a strategic way

  
The French of course
have less to be concerned about

  
in the sense that most of their energy
comes from nuclear power and is domestic

  
So they are not as affected directly
by a cutoff from Russia

  
And also because Macron fancies himself

  
especially as the leader
of the European Commission this year

  
the rotating leadership
occupying the presidency

  
but also with his elections coming up

  
and just given his personal belief
that he can drive diplomacy

  
I believe that even after Kyiv falls

  
and after Zelenskyy
is either killed or forced out

  
that the Americans will not want
to engage in direct diplomacy

  
the Germans probably won't

  
The French will

  
And by the way the Chinese will too

  
And I do believe
that there is a potential

  
and this is a danger
for the cohesiveness of the West

  
that the Chinese and Macron end up being
the postKyiv Normandy format

  
of diplomacy

  
That's something that the Americans
and the Germans right now

  
are starting to worry about quite a bit

  
Now that's the European shift

  
And I think as I said
I think it's permanent

  
I believe the UK is in that camp as well

  
I'm not so sure the United States
is going to be as committed

  
for as long a term

  
It doesn't affect the Americans
as much economically

  
it doesn't affect the Americans as much
in terms of a direct security issue

  
None of those refugees are coming
to the United States

  
But also American inequality

  
American political polarization
and dysfunction is so much greater

  
than what you experience
on the continent in Europe

  
So the potential that in six months' time
or in two years' time

  
as we're thinking about the  election

  
that the Americans have largely forgotten
about this Russia issue instead

  
are focusing once again
on domestic political opponents

  
as principal adversaries

  
which deeply undermines NATO

  
much more than anything
that would come from the Europeans

  
I think that is a real
open question going forward

  
that is perhaps as significant
as the question of where the Chinese go

  
BG Let me pick up on the point
you made about energy

  
because somehow Putin's calculus
can really change

  
if Russian oil and gas
stops flowing to Europe

  
if it becomes part
of the sanctions right

  
And this war indeed can kind of be read

  
as a war about energy

  
Selling energy funds it for Russia

  
being dependent on Russian energy makes
the European response more constrained

  
Rising energy insecurity
rising energy cost

  
may or probably will destabilize
European politics and economy

  
in the coming months

  
How would you look at this
from the perspective of energy

  
and is there any likelihood

  
that Russian oil and gas
is going to stop flowing

  
either because Putin cuts it
or the Europeans sanction it

  
IB Yeah or because it's blown up
in some of the transit in Ukraine

  
I mean keep in mind

  
so much of the gas transit
is going through large pipeline networks

  
which have some redundancy
across all of Ukraine

  
But there's a big war
that's going on right there

  
and lots of people that could have
incentive to create problems

  
The Americans of course the Canadians

  
have said that they're cutting off
oil import from Russia

  
but those are nominal numbers

  
so they don't matter very
much to the markets

  
The Europeans as I said

  
want to decouple themselves
as quickly as possible

  
but they believe that doing that this year
would be economic suicide

  
So there isn't despite everything
we see from Russia

  
they're using thermobaric weapons now
against the Ukrainian people

  
the Americans are warning

  
that they could use chemical
biological weapons against Ukraine

  
I mean you know
you even have some people saying

  
what if they use
a tactical nuclear weapon

  
I mean 

  
God willing none of these
things come to pass

  
But it is very hard to see
a military scenario in Ukraine

  
that leads the Europeans

  
to completely cut off their inbound gas
from Russia this year

  
It's very hard to see

  
And also I would say it's very hard
to see any level of economic sanction

  
that would change the mind of the Russians

  
in terms of their military decision making

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now I think there are a lot of things
that the West is doing

  
in terms of providing weapons
for the Ukrainians

  
that are having an impact on the ground

  
A lot more Russians are getting killed

  
It won’t prevent them
from taking to Kyiv again in my mind

  
I feel quite confident about that

  
But it's quite possible
perhaps even likely

  
that the west of Ukraine
will remain in Ukrainian hands

  
which means that you know
after this fighting is "over"

  
that a rump Ukrainian state in exile
exists in the West run by Zelenskyy

  
or someone that's aligned with him

  
and that they continue to get
enormous economic and military support

  
from all of the NATO countries

  
So even though I don't think

  
that the energy situation
will become so parlous

  
that it would affect
Putin's decision making

  
I do think that the West's response
does matter on the ground

  
BG The war is kind of having radiating
economic shock waves around the world now

  
ripple effects on food markets
for example and food security

  
We talk a lot about energy security

  
what about food security

  
IB Well you have the largest
grain producer in the world

  
invading the fifth largest
grain producer in the world

  
on the back of a twoyear pandemic
that's still ongoing

  
We don't talk about it much anymore
but it's still there

  
And of course this hit the poorest
countries in the world the hardest

  
The level of indebtedness

  
and the unsustainability
of paying that debt off

  
was already becoming a massive problem

  
for so many of the developing
countries in the world

  
And the IMF provided a lot of relief
in special drawing rights and direct aid

  
over the course of the past  months

  
but that money is now running to an end

  
And what happens
when commodity prices spike up

  
and we have severe supply chain challenges
with energy and food

  
and those things
are obviously very related

  
What happens is that a lot of people die

  
What happens is we see
a lot more starvation

  
The World Food Organization says about 
million people a year die of starvation

  
That number in the next  months
is going to be a lot higher

  
than it otherwise would have been

  
The number of people
who are food stressed in the world

  
is going to go way up
in subSaharan Africa in Yemen

  
in Afghanistan in Bangladesh

  
It's going to go way up

  
And you know
it's horrible to think about

  
but the massive impact
of this Russia crisis

  
is going to be much more
global inequality

  
And this is of course

  
a direct consequence of the end
of the peace dividend more structurally

  
That over the last  years
of globalization

  
what did you have

  
A lot of people were left behind

  
but the biggest thing you had

  
was the explosion of a single
global middle class

  
On the back of the pandemic

  
and now this RussiaUkraine war

  
and the decoupling of the Russian
economy from the West

  
which doesn't matter so much in terms
of the size of the Russian economy

  
but it matters immensely in terms
of commodities globally and supply chain

  
those two things are going
to seriously unwind

  
the growth of this global middle class

  
and they're going to stress developing
countries to a much greater degree

  
They will lead to financial crises
in countries like Turkey for example

  
that will no longer be able
to service their debt

  
You'll see more Lebanons out there

  
You'll see some in Latin America
you'll see some in subSaharan Africa

  
Those are the knockon effects and so

  
so many people that have been saying
over the last few weeks

  
"Why are we paying so much
attention to Ukraine

  
It's because they're white people
because they're European

  
We wouldn't pay that much attention
if they were Afghans

  
or if they were you know Afghanis
or if they were Yemenis

  
We wouldn't"

  
I mean first of all you've got millions
and millions of Ukrainian refugees

  
and we're not paying
as much attention to them

  
as we did to the Syrian refugees
precisely because of race

  
precisely because the Europeans
are more willing to integrate

  
millions and millions
of "fellow Europeans" into Europe

  
But we are paying much more attention
to the Ukraine crisis and we should

  
because the impact on the poorest
people around the world

  
is vastly greater

  
from this conflict
than anything that we've seen

  
in any of those smaller economies
with less impact

  
despite all of the human depredation
that’s happened over the past  years

  
BG Ian I want to talk
for a second about climate

  
because another crisis that has kind of
disappeared from the headlines

  
is the climate crisis right

  
Ten days ago the IPCC released a report

  
that the secretary general
of the UN described

  
as an "atlas of human suffering"

  
if I remember correctly

  
And it has been basically ignored

  
Over the last several years

  
much of the world had started to embark
with more or less enthusiasm

  
on a process of transitioning
away from oil and gas

  
and into kind of a clean energy future

  
And now the war comes in

  
and we look at what you just described
the unraveling of global supply chains

  
the dependency on energy and so on

  
And there are kind of two
schools of thought here

  
One says this war is going to accelerate
the adoption of clean energy

  
because we need to diminish dependence
from Russia and these fossil fuels

  
And the other says
the other school of thought says

  
it's going to derail
the transition to clean energy

  
because suddenly the priority
is no longer decarbonization

  
suddenly the priority
is energy security energy supply

  
IB The Europeans
are largely in the first camp

  
and they will move towards faster
decoupling and investment accordingly

  
The Americans are largely
in the second camp

  
and they will move towards

  
"Let's focus more on fossil fuels
and partisan divide on this issue"

  
accordingly

  
The Chinese

  
who are the largest carbon emitter
in the world by a long margin

  
though not per capita
and not historically

  
but still in terms of every year totals

  
they will continue on the same
path they've been on

  
which is a netzero target

  
but without yet a very strong plan
on how to get there

  
and not feeling a lot of pressure
to provide that plan

  
because they think the Americans
are completely incoherent

  
and incapable of effectuating
a strategic longterm plan

  
on climate themselves

  
So I mean what we have is a lot
of progress on climate and of course

  
technology around renewable energies
and around electric batteries

  
and supply chain

  
continue to get cheaper and cheaper

  
as more money is being invested in it

  
And that does make me longterm
more optimistic that by 

  
a majority of the world's energy
will probably be coming from renewables

  
And five years ago
I wouldn't have said that

  
But still I mean when the news today

  
is that the Americans are sending
a highlevel delegation to Caracas

  
to figure out if we can reopen
relations with Venezuela

  
to get them to produce more oil again

  
With the Iranians

  
let's do any deal possible to get back
into the JCPOA the nuclear deal

  
so that we can get that oil on the market

  
Calling the Saudis calling the Emiratis

  
and they’re not willing to take
Biden’s phone call on this issue

  
while they're talking to Putin

  
Those are warning signals
that in the near term

  
we've got some big challenges

  
and a lot of those challenges are going
to be filled with fossil fuels

  
and fossil fuel development

  
And so I do think that the fact

  
that both of the answers to your question
are true in different places

  
on netnet is more negative
for how quickly we can transition

  
BG Let's talk a bit about China

  
Brigid I think
who’s listening in asks

  
"What do you believe
Xi Jinping is learning

  
from the world's response
to the crisis to the Ukrainian war"

  
IB Well certainly learning that this
was a red line for the West

  
And I think that this
would have surprised

  
it obviously surprised Putin

  
I think it would have surprised
Xi Jinping as well

  
Xi Jinping saw Afghanistan

  
He saw that Merkel was out

  
He saw that Macron is focused
on strategic autonomy

  
He sees Biden as much more focused
on China and Asia

  
I think that this
is a surprise to Xi Jinping

  
But Xi Jinping also sees

  
that a lot of the world
is not with NATO on this issue

  
 countries if I remember correctly

  
voted to censor the Russians
for their invasion of Ukraine

  
at the United Nations General Assembly

  
But very large numbers of that 

  
are not on board with all
of these sanctions against Russia

  
They're happy with the diplomatic censure

  
but they need to continue
to work with the Russians

  
The Chinese see that too

  
The Chinese see just how much more
fragmented the global order is

  
I thought the most significant thing
that we've seen from the Chinese so far

  
two issues

  
The first is of course
when Putin went to Beijing

  
and Xi Jinping made
the public announcement

  
that “this is our best friend
on the global stage

  
and we will work much more strategically
with them economically

  
diplomatically and militarily
going forward"

  
And Xi Jinping knew very well
where Ukraine was heading at that point

  
and also knew that the likelihood
of an invasion was coming

  
Didn't stop him from making
that announcement in the slightest

  
And then after the invasion
and it's going badly

  
I mean if you watch Chinese social media

  
the fact is that the censorship
is all about Ukraine

  
I mean the Chinese media space

  
is pursuing a relentlessly
proPutin policy

  
They have media embedded
with Russian troops

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now publicly the Chinese
government wants to be seen

  
as “We’re neutral we like the Russians

  
we like the Ukrainians

  
we still want to work with everybody"

  
But the fact is that China
feels no problem

  
being publicly completely
aligned with Putin

  
despite the fact that they are invading
a democratic government

  
with  million people
in the middle of Europe

  
That's a pretty astonishing
statement from the Chinese

  
And there's no question
that they have learned

  
that they're in a vastly better
economic position than they used to be

  
and that gives them influence

  
They are a government
who projects its power

  
primarily through economic
and technological means

  
as opposed to Russia that projects it
primarily through military means

  
And the Chinese believe

  
that there is a level of decoupling
that is already going on

  
as the Americans focus
on more industrial policy

  
as they focus on America first
for American workers

  
A US foreign policy for the American
middle class as Biden put it

  
is one that really pushes a lot of capital
to leave a country like China

  
which had served
as the factory for the world

  
but at the expense of a lot of labor

  
coming out of advanced
industrial economies

  
And now yes there are
definitely some dangers

  
that come from the Chinese being perceived
as too close to Russia

  
and they won't want that

  
and they'll want to make sure
that they're engaging diplomatically

  
with the Europeans
to try to minimize that damage

  
But I thought it was very interesting

  
and I'm not sure this is public yet

  
that the Chinese ambassador to Russia
recently in the last few days

  
organized a meeting of a lot
of the top investors

  
Chinese investors in Russia saying

  
"This is a unique opportunity
the West is leaving

  
we should be going in and doing more

  
Because they're going to be completely
reliant on us going forward"

  
That is not a message
that the Chinese ambassador delivers

  
unless he is told
directly to from Beijing

  
BG Ian I'm going to jump
from topic to topic

  
because there are several
questions in the chat

  
Nancy is asking about whether Putin
can be removed from power

  
There's been a lot of discussion lately
about regime change in Russia

  
either endogenous like a palace coup

  
or provoked by sanctions
and other policies

  
And so she asks

  
"How likely is that Putin will face
a challenge from inside Russia

  
whether a popular uprising
a coup or other"

  
IB It's very very unlikely
until it happens

  
(Chuckles)

  
I mean in the sense
that there is absolutely no purpose

  
in trying to say oh I mean you know

  
there are rumors that Defense Minister
Shoigu is unhappy and you know

  
he might be making a move

  
And I’ve seen these
from relatively credible analysts

  
I'm like no no
if there are such rumors

  
then we know it's not happening

  
because that's the end
of Shoigu and his family

  
But it's very clear that there is more
pressure on Putin now

  
than at any point
since he's been president

  
Domestic pressure on Putin

  
About  Russians
have been arrested so far detained

  
most of them have been released

  
for nonviolent antiwar protests

  
The Russians have shut down
all the Western media

  
They've shut down all the Russian
opposition and independent media

  
So Putin has control of the space

  
though if you look at Russian
conversations on Telegram

  
you'll still see a bunch of people
that are seriously seriously antiwar

  
But you know once the economy
starts truly imploding

  
and you can't find goods on shelves
in Russia in major cities

  
and this is coming you know very soon
this is a matter of days

  
in many of these cities

  
those demonstrations
will likely become greater

  
some of them can become violent

  
You know that'll increase the pressure

  
Then you have the issue of how
the Russians are fighting on the ground

  
I mean what happens
if you get a lot of desertions

  
We haven't seen that so far

  
What happens if you get
orders to bomb Kyiv

  
and a whole bunch of Russian
fighter pilots bomber pilots

  
decide not to and they defect
to Poland to Germany

  
That would have a big impact on morale

  
That has not happened so far

  
I mean do be aware of the fact

  
that the Ukrainians are winning
the war on information

  
and that means that the information
that you are getting in the West

  
about the war

  
is much more proUkrainian 

  
morale enthusiasm

  
how well the military is doing 

  
than what's actually
happening on the ground

  
And also be aware of the fact

  
that the Russians completely control
the war on information inside Russia

  
BG Exactly

  
IB They're not getting a balanced view

  
They're getting a completely
proPutin view

  
And most of them actually believe it

  
in the same way that most people
that voted for Trump in the US

  
believe that the election was stolen
and Trump is still president

  
I mean it's much worse
in Russia in that regard

  
than it is in the United States

  
and I think that that's
underappreciated in the West

  
So even though I think there's pressure

  
I really don't think
that it's super likely

  
that Putin is out anytime imminently

  
BG Ed is asking whether you see
any offramp for Putin

  
IB I think that the most likely offramp
for Putin is after Kyiv is taken

  
and Zelenskyy is removed
one way or the other

  
at that point

  
the possibility of the Russians
accepting a frozen conflict

  
or a cease fire that could lead
to ongoing negotiations

  
is a lot higher

  
because Putin can sell that as a win
back home much more easily

  
But also because further
Russian attacks at that point

  
serve much less purpose for the Russians

  
are much harder to bring about

  
and potentially have much more
negative consequences

  
So for me that would be
the nearterm potential break

  
where we could at least freeze issues
largely where they are

  
Now whether that could then eventually
lead to a climbdown or not

  
I mean the Russians have been very happy
with frozen conflicts on their borders

  
for years and years and years

  
I'm thinking about NagornoKarabakh
between Armenia and Azerbaijan

  
which basically stayed in place
until the Azeris

  
over the course of a decade
got enough military capacity

  
that they could forcibly change
the situation on the ground

  
Which by the way the Ukrainians might
also be eventually thinking about

  
because the West will be supplying them
with advanced weapons all the way through

  
I'm thinking South Ossetia in Georgia

  
I'm also of course thinking
about the two pieces of Ukraine

  
they took back in 

  
So be aware of the fact that a negotiation
that creates a cease fire

  
does not mean you're anywhere
close to a resolution

  
or an end of the fighting
that we're seeing

  
BG Someone else in the chat
who didn't sign by his or her name

  
is asking about the nuclear fear
that hangs over the conflict

  
How should we think of that

  
IB Yeah we don't like it
when Putin uses the Nword

  
and there's no question

  
I mean he and his direct reports
have rattled nuclear sabers

  
on at least five times
that I've seen in the past few weeks

  
I think that 

  
In  I wasn't alive
we had the Cuban Missile Crisis

  
There was a real possibility
of nuclear confrontation

  
between the world's two superpowers

  
At least for the last  years
there’s been no chance of that

  
Functionally no chance of that

  
I think we're now back in a world

  
where a Cuban Missile Crisis
is again a reality

  
Now that doesn't mean that I think
nuclear war is likely or imminent

  
I don't

  
And in fact

  
there is active deconfliction
going on even today

  
the Americans and Russians
with a new hotline

  
the secretary general of the UN

  
with the Russian defense minister

  
engaging in deconfliction
measures with UN

  
offices being invited to Moscow

  
So as bad as it is right now

  
people that have been
doing this for a long time

  
are trying to avoid nuclear war

  
But that's the point

  
Is we're now in a situation

  
where the conflict
that we're going to experience

  
needs to be actively managed

  
because of the danger
of nuclear confrontation

  
So it now becomes a risk on the horizon
that we must be continually aware of

  
even if only at a low level

  
as we take and consider further actions

  
as we consider diplomacy

  
as we consider escalation

  
It is now on the table in a way
that frankly is so debilitating

  
I mean as human beings all on this call

  
one of the most painful
things to think about

  
is the fact that we still have
these  nuclear warheads in Russia

  
and  the United States
that are still pointed at each other

  
and they still have the potential
to destroy the planet

  
And we haven't had any real
lessons that we've been able to learn

  
institutionally from 

  
BG  being a generic figure
not the exact figure

  
but we are kind of
in that order of magnitude

  
Then of course there is the question
of civilian nuclear

  
so the two power plants
nuclear power plants

  
that have been seized by the Russians

  
One has been slightly damaged by a bomb

  
the other has been turned off

  
But those are also potentially gigantic
nuclear problems just waiting to happen

  
IB Chemical weapons biological weapons

  
I mean look we have had two million
refugees from Ukraine in two weeks

  
As this continues you're looking
at five to  million refugees

  
I mean it is hard 

  
Just take a step for a moment
just as a human being

  
Imagine what it would take for a quarter
of your country's population

  
to say “I am not living here anymore

  
I am leaving everything
because of the condition of the country

  
because of this unjust war

  
that has been imposed upon you
by your neighbor"

  
That's what we're looking at

  
And again it's important
for us to you know

  
not lose the humanity of this crisis

  
and the extraordinary hardship

  
that is being visited
upon  million Ukrainians

  
that have done nothing wrong
they have committed no sin

  
other than their desire to have
an independent country

  
BG One other country

  
that has not yet taken
a very clear position is India

  
IB Well they're a member of the Quad

  
and their relationship with China
is pretty bad and that’s mutual

  
But in terms of Russia

  
there's been a longstanding relationship

  
trade relationship defense relationship

  
between India and Russia

  
that the Russians
are not going to jettison

  
and they see no reason to jettison it

  
And as long as you've got a whole bunch
of other countries out there

  
that are substantial
that are willing to say

  
we're going to keep playing ball
with the Russians

  
then the Indians will too

  
And that's why you've got the abstention
in the United Nations vote

  
And that's why you've had
very careful comments

  
as opposed to overt
and strong condemnation

  
coming from the Indian leadership

  
BG Phil in the chat is asking

  
"Will this cause a fragmentation
of the financial system

  
with kind of a Western system
and an Eastern system”

  
So two different SWIFTlike systems
two different credit card systems

  
crypto what's the role
of crypto in all this

  
IB I hope not

  
I mean I will tell you
that before the invasion started

  
if you talk to most Western CEOs

  
and I'm talking across
the entire sweep of sectors

  
so it's finance and it's manufacturing
and its services and it's tech

  
most of them would have told you
that they did not in any way plan

  
on reducing their footprint in China

  
and a lot of them said

  
that China was their most important
growth market in the world

  
Not a surprise

  
China is going to be the largest
economy in the world in 

  
So you know a world
that you're decoupling

  
is not a good world

  
when China is going to be
number one economically

  
I mean that obviously
is going to hurt the West in a big way

  
So there are strong
incentives against that

  
and there remain very strong
and powerful entrenched interests

  
in the United States and Europe
that will resist direct decoupling

  
Despite the fact that there are
these more incremental moves

  
towards friendsourcing and insourcing

  
because you know
Chinese labor is more expensive

  
you don’t need as much labor
to get capital moving

  
given robotics

  
and big data deep learning
all of those things

  
But I do think that the Russia conflict

  
risks a level of secondorder decoupling

  
Because if the Russians end up
financially integrated with China

  
in their own

  
notaseffective SWIFT system

  
and all of their energy
ends up going to China

  
and the Chinese build that infrastructure
and they get a discount on it

  
and Russia's technology and their military
industrial complex gets serviced

  
by Chinese semiconductors
and Chinese componentry

  
well I do think that there will be
knockon decoupling

  
that will be longer term
and more strategic

  
from the United States from the Europeans

  
and even from Japan and South Korea

  
So that is a worry

  
and I think the Chinese
are highly aware of that

  
And over the coming months
they will do everything they can

  
both with the Europeans in particular

  
but also I expect at least
with some of the Asian economies

  
to try to limit the impact of that

  
Now keep in mind

  
we haven't talked at all
about Asia yet outside of China

  
The new Japanese Prime Minister Kishida
is at least as hawkish

  
in his orientation towards
China and Russia as Abe was

  
He is providing support
for the Ukrainians

  
including some military capacity 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
He's allowing Ukrainian refugees 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
And yesterday the South Koreans
had a very very tight election

  
and Yoon is now in charge

  
He is on the right and he is the guy
that is strongly antiChina

  
was talking about South Korea
having nuclear capabilities

  
wants a new THAAD missile
defense system for the South Koreans

  
and wants to rebuild
the relationship with Tokyo

  
That matters

  
And that's a big strategic change
in the geopolitical map

  
that will look more problematic
on the decoupling front

  
from Beijing's perspective

  
BG Three final quick questions
that all come from the chat Ian

  
One is because you mentioned
the rest of Asia outside of China

  
"What about the rest of the world

  
What about Africa and Latin America

  
How do they factor into this
conversation or don't they"

  
IB They factor in

  
I mean those that have
significant commodities do well

  
because the prices
are going to be so high

  
Those that don't are going to be
under massive pressure

  
for reasons we already talked about

  
but they are not going to be forced
to pick a side on this one

  
I just don't see it

  
In the same way that if you were Colombia
in the last couple of years

  
you know you found

  
even though you're working very closely
with an American ally

  
you're still dealing with Huawei and G

  
This is knockon effects of all of this

  
These are countries
that are not going to take on

  
significant economic burden

  
given how much they're suffering
right now geopolitically

  
BG Another one is about sanctions

  
How do we even know when and how

  
at what point we start
rolling back sanctions

  
IB I think that as long
as Ukraine is occupied

  
by the Russian government

  
for the foreseeable future
and Putin is there

  
I can't see these sanctions
getting unwound

  
Now if a rump Ukrainian government
that is democratically elected

  
were prepared to sue for peace
and retakes most of Ukraine

  
but they give away Crimea
and they give away the Donbass

  
could you see in that environment
some of these sanctions unwound

  
Sure

  
But I mean I am suggesting

  
that I think that many of these sanctions
are functionally permanent

  
They reflect a new way of doing business

  
And when people ask me
what’s going to happen when this is over

  
my response is what do you mean over

  
What's over is the peace dividend

  
We are now in a new environment

  
BG And one of the figures
of this new environment

  
and I want to close with that
is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine

  
who was not taken very seriously
when he was elected

  
he has come out as a significant
figure in this war

  
What do you make of President Zelenskyy

  
How do you read this character

  
IB He's very courageous

  
I'm obviously inspired by his ability
to communicate and rally his people

  
and take personal risk in Kyiv
while this invasion is going on

  
But I'm very conflicted

  
because I think many of the steps
that Zelenskyy took

  
in the runup to this conflict

  
actually made the likelihood
of conflict worse

  
He was unwilling to take the advice
of the Americans and Europeans seriously

  
in the months leading up to the conflict

  
He was unwilling to mobilize his people

  
to ready them for
the potential of conflict

  
He was certainly unwilling to give an inch

  
in terms of Ukraine's desire
to be a member of NATO

  
even though he knew completely

  
that no one in NATO was prepared
to offer a membership action plan

  
let alone actually
bring them in as members

  
And part of that is a lack of experience

  
and lack of any business
being in that position

  
in the runup to this crisis

  
So I’m very deeply conflicted
in my personal views on Zelenskyy

  
given the way he behaved
before the invasion

  
compared to the extraordinary leadership
that he has displayed to all of us

  
over the last two weeks

  
BG Ian thank you for taking the time

  
for sharing your knowledge
and your analysis with us

  
We deeply appreciate it
Thank you very much

“Turn the tides

  
We must give back”

  
chant my ancestors

  
The thunder strikes 

  
(Hands clap)

  
as the sea demoness 
swept through the lands

  
with a fiery likeness of Letao’s fire

  
Tearing apart livelihood

  
the mounting waves and erosions
leave my island gaping

  
like the mouth of a dead fish

  
Tense muscles of uncles and aunties

  
that hauled cement for the seawall

  
cooked meals for the hungry bellies

  
Release in relief

  
The tides have gone out

  
I look to my grandparents’ graves

  
intimate with limp seaweeds

  
The disrespect

  
(Marshallese) Iakwe nan aolep

  
My name is Selina Leem

  
At  at the COP 

  
alongside late ambassador
for climate change Tony de Brum

  
I introduced myself
as a small island girl with big dreams

  
Five years later I reintroduced myself

  
as a climate warrior from Aelon Kein Ad

  
the Marshall Islands

  
Situated between Hawaii and Australia

  
our chain of islands decorate
the Pacific Ocean like seashells

  
and they are home to about  people

  
Our islands average about
two meters above sea level

  
and it is not uncommon to see
both the ocean and lagoon side

  
from wherever you stand

  
We say our highest point

  
is the bridge which curves
about seven meters above the sea

  
The massive body of water
is our reality and our livelihood

  
With a history of seafaring

  
the ocean connected our islands together

  
as well as providing
many resources to fish

  
to feed

  
and to adorn our handicrafts
with seashells that we make a living from

  
But the climate crisis has brought
calamities to my people

  
threatening our very livelihoods

  
In the Pacific king tide season
is from November to April

  
This is when the tides
are at their highest

  
and each year the sea level rises

  
In these months especially houses
by the seashore end up flooded

  
or damaged completely

  
Schools and churches have had to open
their doors for community members

  
to come sleep at

  
when announcements come in the radio
advising to find shelter

  
because of incoming tides

  
And we huddled together
with our blankets and pillows

  
no matter that we are strangers
as we sleep next to one another

  
Seawalls are rebuilt
as soon as it’s low tide

  
only to be broken down again

  
by the waves that grow higher each year

  
And these waves

  
their path continues on into the islands

  
bringing with it garbage
we’ve thrown into it

  
You see the graves of your loved ones
submerged in water

  
littered

  
Then the vegetation starts to brown;

  
it is dying

  
The soil becomes salinated

  
You pray the bigger trees hold on

  
for their roots are needed
to prevent further erosion

  
In the most effected parts of the lands

  
the land has regressed

  
coming closer and closer
to the road each year

  
Our driest part of the year happens
within this time period too

  
We are unable to use groundwater well
because it becomes saltier as well

  
In the capital Majuro once per week

  
water is dispensed

  
and my neighbors and I fill up our tanks

  
our water catchments

  
our bottles and our buckets

  
Our government has had to declare
a state of national emergency

  
calling for help from our friends

  
Sealevel rising

  
flooding

  
droughts

  
erosion have been the reality
of my people for many many many years

  
We’ve been told to move

  
To become climate change refugees

  
I’m not even sure
who would even take us in

  
But to those who think
that we can just accept our fate

  
I want to say

  
Adaptation and Indigenous knowledge 
are the solutions

  
These islands are our ancestors

  
our predecessors

  
our homes

  
We are at the risk of losing all of that

  
for something we contributed
very very little to

  
Raising and expanding the islands
is something my country is thinking of

  
However we don’t have the resources
nor the infrastructure

  
Regardless

  
we remain adamant

  
We continue to fight for our livelihoods

  
and not abandon our home

  
Thank you

It’s the morning of June th 

  
and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic  kilometer journey

  
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather

  
flying an average of  kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight

  
Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the DDay invasion back to England

  
He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment

  
Paddy was one of around  pigeons

  
used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages

  
In fact pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices

  
Seeing their meat as a protein source

  
and their nitrogenrich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer

  
humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as  years ago

  
We then tapped into other traits

  
Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct

  
that drives them to navigate
long distances

  
back to the location they consider “home”

  
So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing

  
In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying”

  
people selected for traits 
like head plumage

  
and fabulously feathered feet

  
As we carried pigeons around the world
they escaped or were released

  
forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today

  
Pigeons are now one of the most abundant
widespread species on the planet

  
managing to thrive in chaotic cities

  
They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits

  
including some that were
accentuated by humans

  
Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees

  
pigeons were originally cliffdwellers

  
City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat

  
And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking

  
Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass

  
and it's a great spot to raise babies

  
This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments

  
where more specialized species can’t

  
As generalists pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste

  
With an organ in their throats 
called a crop

  
they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later

  
They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food

  
Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and proteinrich meal

  
If conditions are right
pigeons breed yearround

  
and produce new offspring every six weeks

  
They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities

  
because of the abundance 
of food and shelter

  
These booming populations 
attract predators

  
New York City is home 
to a million pigeons

  
which support large populations
of raptors

  
But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight

  
further exploited by being bred
for racing

  
means they’re made 
for high speed chases

  
Compared to barn owls
which are a similar size

  
pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved

  
providing extra space for muscle mass

  
They can reach speeds 
of  kilometers per hour

  
And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout

  
While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife

  
we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors

  
In  New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings”

  
and it stuck

  
Indeed their poop

  
which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer presents a unique problem

  
Just one pigeon can leave behind 
 kilograms of acidic excrement per year

  
which in the United States 
scales to about $ billion

  
in structural damage annually

  
Though incidents of infection are rare

  
this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled

  
They may be numerous noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch

  
but the pigeons that swirl around us

  
are evidence of an ancient 
ongoing relationship

  
Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort

  
For better or for worse 
we did this to ourselves

  
The world can be a toxic place

  
No one knows this more
than women and girls

  
cis and trans

  
as well as nonbinary people

  
I am a journalist

  
with  years’ experience

  
reporting on the injustices women
and others face around the world

  
I’m a cofounder of the Man Up Campaign

  
to energize youth activism
against sexual and genderbased violence

  
I’m a father to two daughters

  
I’m a life partner to a woman

  
and I’m a Black man in America

  
Holding these identities 

  
and many more 

  
I say this call to action to you

  
with the deepest sincerity

  
and utmost gravity

  
It is time for a gender reckoning

  
beginning with men authentically
confronting our internal selves

  
and each other

  
through the toxicity within us

  
Against the backdrop
of Black Lives Matter protest

  
cries for a racial reckoning
have echoed throughout the world

  
at times seeming premature

  
and largely misunderstood

  
I believe a true gender reckoning
must be the center

  
of any transformative movement
for social justice and equity

  
But what is a reckoning

  
Dictionaries say it means
to resolve a bill or a debt

  
In other words to settle an account

  
In the case of women and girls

  
what is the debt owed to them

  
Who’s to pay it

  
And how

  
The consequences of male toxicity
continue building

  
the debt to which I refer

  
including among others

  
a gender wealth gap most affecting women
who care for their families

  
as well as act as the primary
income generators

  
for their households

  
Today in the United States and abroad

  
threats to reproductive justice endanger
the lives and hardfought rights of women

  
in regards to their bodily
sexual and gender autonomy

  
impacting the most disenfranchised
community in society

  
And violence against women

  
in all of its forms

  
still represents
an existential challenge

  
as we’ve seen domestic violence
rise in the pandemic

  
as people were confined to their homes

  
we’ve seen online and public
harassment flourish

  
unabated

  
The sexual trafficking

  
prostitution

  
exploitation of women and girls
thrives as ever before

  
From where does this toxicity come

  
and why

  
Men are not endangered

  
we’re not under assault

  
we’re not being unfairly maligned

  
In fact it’s men or certain types of
masculinity that are the issue

  
To be clear

  
being a man does not make me

  
or anyone else who identifies as a man

  
inherently toxic

  
But masculinity

  
in certain forms

  
can harm women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
and men

  
through violence

  
dominating power

  
and control

  
So how do we address this

  
How can we men step up

  
and better support our daughters

  
our sisters

  
our female partners

  
our colleagues neighbors and friends

  
Through what means can men both instigate
and lead a gender reckoning

  
First we must tell the truth

  
We must tell the truth

  
Men grow into this world
becoming who we’re expected to be

  
or who we think we’re expected to be

  
based on cultural expectations

  
and inaccurate historical narratives

  
As a short chubby Black kid
wearing glasses growing up

  
I was repeatedly told I cried too much

  
I’m too emotional

  
too soft

  
It was ingrained in me
that to prove my masculinity

  
I had to display physical prowess 

  
intimidation

  
Because of that indoctrination

  
as an adult

  
I refused to seek help
facing escalating health challenges

  
including high blood pressure

  
and mental trauma

  
The archetype of manhood nearly killed me

  
I say that as a survivor
of two heart attacks

  
four years on dialysis

  
and a kidney transplant 

  
aside from the physical risk
I put myself into

  
covering wars around the world

  
The injury we do to ourselves

  
and the women around us

  
comes from fear of losing control

  
of lack of external affirmation

  
and simply out of shame

  
Manhood is a spectrum of identities

  
There is no one way to be a man

  
And sometimes discovering one’s true
manhood is a lifelong journey

  
Secondly

  
we must be consistent

  
Men

  
especially men of color

  
cannot expect women to stand up for us

  
with us in the face
of systemic oppressions

  
when too often we do not
do the same for them

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
(Applause)

  
The Black Lives Matter
movement for example

  
founded named and led
by queer women of color

  
still centers Black men’s wellbeing

  
in the face of unfair policing

  
and criminal justice systems

  
And where’s the reciprocal
support from those men

  
including myself

  
in addressing intercommunity violence
against women of color

  
maternal health inequity

  
economic disparity

  
How and where do men show up for women

  
I wonder 

  
how many men stood with women
on the steps of the US Supreme Court

  
as they fought for reproductive rights

  
How many men should have been there

  
Finally there can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
There can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
Men who commit acts of violence against
women must be held accountable

  
by formal systems of justice

  
as well as other men

  
Silence in the face of misogynistic
behavior and language is complicity

  
We men need to break free from the pack

  
take concrete actions to stop violence

  
create safety

  
and build equity

  
And most importantly

  
say something

  
To be sure

  
bold men around us are actively working
to disrupt the narrative of male toxicity

  
After the  earthquake in Haiti

  
a local organization

  
KOFAVIV

  
invited men to be defenders of women
and girls in displacement camps

  
women and girls who were
at risk of sexual assault

  
Scores of men answered the call

  
and can continue to do so today

  
In New York City

  
CONNECT NYC

  
led by a Black man

  
actively engages community partners
across civil society

  
to address family violence

  
And in a profession not known generally
for its advocacy against gender violence

  
a professional player
for the Washington Football Team

  
has become an unabashed advocate

  
for men to learn

  
and actively change behaviors
regarding sexual and physical violence

  
There is hope;

  
there is light

  
Men around the world
are putting in the work

  
to catalyze a true gender reckoning

  
But far more are needed

  
What I want to say to you today is this

  
Too many of us 

  
too many men 

  
don’t understand

  
that equity

  
justice

  
inclusivity

  
safety for women girls
and nonbinary people

  
serves and saves us all

  
Broken masculinity harms societies

  
full stop

  
When we men reckon with that truth

  
we will finally find our shared humanity

  
Women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
men

  
standing together on equal footing

  
with mutual respect

  
in safe environments

  
is the greatest
gender reckoning we can create

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Imagine a scientist

  
who wants to send a robot
to explore in a faraway place

  
a place whose geography
might be completely unknown

  
and perhaps inhospitable

  
Now imagine that instead
of first designing that robot

  
and sending it off in the hope
that it might be suitable

  
instead she sends
a robotproducing technology

  
that figures out what kind of robot
is needed once it arrives

  
builds it and then enables it
to continue to evolve

  
to adapt to its new surroundings

  
It’s exactly what my collaborators
and I are working on

  
a radical new technology
which enables robots to be created

  
reproduce and evolve
over long periods of time

  
a technology where robot design
and fabrication becomes a task

  
for machines rather than humans

  
Robots are already all around us
in factories in hospitals in our home

  
But from an engineer's perspective

  
designing a shelfstacking robot
or a Roomba to clean our home

  
is relatively straightforward

  
We know exactly what they need to do

  
and we can imagine the kind of situations
they might find themselves in

  
So we design with this in mind

  
But what if we want
to send that robot to operate

  
in a place that we have little
or even no knowledge about

  
For example cleaning up legacy waste
inside a nuclear reactor

  
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
mining for minerals deep in a trench
at the bottom of the ocean

  
or exploring a faraway asteroid

  
How frustrating would it be
if the humandesigned robot

  
that had taken years
to get to the asteroid

  
suddenly found it needed to drill a hole

  
to collect a sample or clamber up a cliff

  
but it didn't have the right tools

  
or the right means of locomotion to do so

  
If instead we had a technology

  
that enabled the robots to be designed
and optimized in situ

  
in the environment
in which they need to live and work

  
then we could potentially save
years of wasted effort

  
and produce robots
that are uniquely adapted

  
to the environments
that they find themselves in

  
So to realize this technology
we've been turning to nature for help

  
All around us

  
we see examples of biological species

  
that have evolved smart adaptations

  
that enable them to thrive
in a given environment

  
For example in the Cuban rainforest

  
we find vines that have evolved leaves

  
that are shaped like
humandesigned satellite dishes

  
These leaves direct bats to their flowers

  
by amplifying the signals
that the bats send out

  
therefore improving pollination

  
What if we could create
an artificial version of evolution

  
that would enable robots
to evolve in a similar manner

  
as biological organisms

  
I'm not talking about biomimicry

  
a technology which simply copies
what's observed in nature

  
What we're hoping to harness
is the creativity of evolution

  
to discover designs
that are not observed here on Earth

  
the human engineer
might not have thought of

  
or even be capable of conceiving

  
In theory

  
this evolutionary design technology
could operate completely autonomously

  
in a faraway place

  
But equally it could be guided by humans

  
Just as we breed plants for qualities
such as drought resistance or taste

  
the human robot breeder could guide
artificial evolution to producing robots

  
with specific qualities

  
For example

  
the ability to squeeze
through a narrow gap

  
or perhaps operate at low energy

  
This idea of artificial evolution
imitating biological evolution

  
using a computer program

  
to breed better and better solutions
to problems over time

  
isn't actually new

  
In fact artificial evolution

  
algorithms operating inside a computer

  
have been used to design everything
from tables to turbine blades

  
Back in 

  
NASA even sent a satellite into space
with a communication antenna

  
that had been designed
by artificial evolution

  
But evolving robots
is actually much harder

  
than evolving passive objects
such as tables

  
because robots need brains
as well as bodies

  
in order to make sense of the information
in the world around them

  
and translate that
into appropriate behaviors

  
So how do we do it

  
Surprisingly evolution only needs
three ingredients

  
a population of individuals which
exhibit some physical variations;

  
a method of reproduction

  
in which offspring inherit
some traits from their parents

  
and occasionally acquire
new ones via mutation;

  
and finally a means of natural selection

  
So we can replicate these three
ingredients to evolve robots

  
using a mixture of hardware and software

  
The first task is to design
a digital version of DNA

  
That is a digital blueprint that describes
the robot's brain its body

  
its sensory mechanisms
and its means of locomotion

  
Using a randomly generated
set of these blueprints

  
we can create an initial population
of  or more robots

  
to kickstart this evolutionary process

  
We've designed a technology
that can take the digital blueprint

  
and turn it into a physical robot
without any need for human assistance

  
For example it uses a D printer
to print the skeleton of the robot

  
and then an automated assembly arm
like you might find in a factory

  
to add any electronics and moving parts

  
including a small computer
that acts as a brain

  
And to enable this brain to adapt
to the new body of the robot

  
we send every robot produced
to an equivalent of a kindergarten

  
a place where the newborn robot
can refine its motor skills

  
almost like a small child would

  
To mimic natural selection

  
we score these robots
on the ability to conduct a task

  
And then we use these scores

  
to selectively decide
which robots get to reproduce

  
The reproduction mechanism

  
mixes the digital DNA
of the chosen parent robots

  
to create a new blueprint
for a child robot

  
that inherits some of the
characteristics from its parents

  
but occasionally also
exhibits some new ones

  
And by repeating the cycle of selection
and reproduction over and over again

  
we hope that we can breed
successive generations of robots

  
where just like is often observed
in biological evolution

  
each generation gets better than the last

  
with the robots gradually optimizing
their form and their behavior

  
to the task and the environment
that they find themselves in

  
Now although this can all take place

  
in a time frame that's much faster
than biological evolution

  
which sometimes takes thousands of years

  
it's still relatively slow in terms
of the time frames we might expect

  
in our modern world

  
to design and produce an artifact

  
It's mainly due
to the D printing process

  
which can take more
than four hours per robot

  
depending on the complexity
and the shape of the robot

  
But we can give our artificial
evolutionary process a helping hand

  
to reduce the number of physical robots
that we actually need to make

  
We create a digital copy
of every robot produced

  
inside a simulation in a computer

  
and we allow this virtual
population of robots to evolve

  
Now it's quite likely that the simulation
isn't a very accurate representation

  
of the real world

  
But it has an advantage that it enables
models of robots to be created

  
and tested in seconds rather than hours

  
So using the simulator technology

  
we can quickly explore the potential
of a wide range of robot types

  
of different shapes and sizes
of different sensory configurations

  
and quickly get a rough estimate
of how useful each robot may be

  
before we physically make it

  
And we predict that by allowing
a novel form of breeding

  
in which a physical robot can breed
with one of its virtual cousins

  
then the useful traits
that have been discovered in simulation

  
will quickly spread into
the physical robot population

  
where they can be further refined in situ

  
It might sound like science fiction

  
but actually there's a serious point

  
While we expect the technology
that I've just described

  
to be useful in designing robots

  
for example to work in situations
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
or to help us pursue our scientific quest
for exoplanetary exploration

  
there are some more pragmatic reasons

  
why we should consider
artificial evolution

  
As climate change gathers pace

  
it is clear that we need a radical rethink

  
to our approach to robotic
design here on Earth

  
in order to reduce
that ecological footprint

  
For example

  
creating new designs of robot
built from sustainable materials

  
that operate at low energy

  
that are repairable and recyclable

  
It's quite likely that this
new generation of robots

  
won't look anything like the robots
that we see around us today

  
but that's exactly why
artificial evolution might help

  
Discovering novel designs by processes
that are unfettered by the constraints

  
that our own understanding
of engineering science

  
imposes on the design process

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Around the globe

  
there are approximately  million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

  
to escape war violence and persecution

  
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons

  
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries

  
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries

  
They are commonly referred to as refugees

  
But what exactly does that term mean

  
The world has known refugees 
for millennia

  
but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's  Convention

  
relating to the status of refugees

  
in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War

  
It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality

  
and is unable to return 
to their home country

  
because of wellfounded fears
of being persecuted

  
That persecution may be due to their race
religion nationality

  
membership in a particular social group
or political opinion

  
and is often related to war and violence

  
Today roughly half the world's refugees
are children

  
some of them unaccompanied by an adult

  
a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor

  
or sexual exploitation

  
Each refugee's story is different

  
and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes

  
But before we get 
to what their journeys involve

  
let's clear one thing up

  
There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms

  
"migrant" and "refugee"

  
"Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country

  
for reasons not related to persecution

  
such as searching 
for better economic opportunities

  
or leaving droughtstricken areas
in search of better circumstances

  
There are many people around the world
who have been displaced

  
because of natural disasters

  
food insecurities

  
and other hardships

  
but international law rightly or wrongly

  
only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees

  
So what happens when someone
flees their country

  
Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous

  
with limited access to shelter
water or food

  
Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected

  
belongings might be left behind

  
and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents

  
like visas to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries

  
Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling

  
by standard routes

  
This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea

  
and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers

  
to help them cross borders

  
Whereas some people seek safety
with their families

  
others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind

  
with the hopes of being reunited later

  
This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long

  
While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities

  
sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp

  
usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments

  
Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures

  
offering shortterm shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home

  
be integrated to the host country

  
or resettle in another country

  
But resettlement and longterm 
integration options are often limited

  
So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years

  
and sometimes even decades

  
Once in a new country the first legal
step for a displaced person

  
is to apply for asylum

  
At this point they are an asylum seeker

  
and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted

  
While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee

  
every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum

  
and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee

  
Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially

  
Host countries have several duties

  
towards people they have 
recognized as refugees

  
like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and nondiscrimination

  
The most basic obligation towards refugees
is nonrefoulement

  
a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual

  
to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened

  
In reality however refugees are
frequently the victims

  
of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment

  
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia

  
and racism

  
And all too often they aren't permitted
to enter the work force

  
and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid

  
In addition far too many refugee children
are out of school

  
due to lack of funding 
for education programs

  
If you go back in your own family history

  
chances are you will discover that
at a certain point

  
your ancestors were forced 
from their homes

  
either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution

  
It would be good of us to remember
their stories

  
when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced

  
searching for a new home

  
We're going to have hotter
drier summers in our cities

  
We're going to have to deal
with more frequent and intense heat waves

  
It's going to have an impact
on our health and wellbeing

  
but not just us

  
What about the plants and animals
that call our cities home

  
So what could we do about that

  
We could green our cities
we could plant trees

  
The shade provided by trees
provides protection

  
from those impacts of the heat

  
But what do we need to make
those plants thrive and survive

  
We need water

  
Our green cities need water
but mosquitoes also like water

  
And so how can we balance the impacts
that come from both of those

  
if we perhaps are inadvertently
creating increasing pests

  
and public health risks for ourselves

  
in the ways in which we try to respond
to a changing climate

  
How can we green our cities
and not create a problem with mosquitoes

  
The mosquito is the deadliest
animal on the planet

  
About half a million people die every year
because of mosquito bite

  
Diseases such as malaria and dengue

  
infect hundreds of millions
of people every year across the planet

  
That burden of disease
weighs quite heavily

  
on both communities and local authorities

  
as they struggle to try to deal
with those impacts

  
Here in Australia
we're very fortunate to be free

  
of some of the more serious
mosquitoborne diseases

  
but there are still pathogens
spread by local mosquitoes

  
that can make us sick

  
So something like Ross River virus

  
If we get infected with this virus
we may not die

  
but we could get seriously ill

  
Fever rash joint pain fatigue 

  
We could be battling illness
for many months

  
But notwithstanding the burden of disease

  
what about the nuisance that mosquitoes
can have just to our daytoday lives

  
How many of you have been
bothered by mosquitoes

  
when you're outside enjoying the barbecue

  
or visiting the local wetlands
during summer

  
What about that mosquito
that buzzes around your bedroom at night

  
How can we manage these risks
and move forward

  
and try to live in a greener city

  
and not create opportunities
for mosquitoes

  
So I spend my summers
sloshing about in wetlands

  
wrangling mosquitoes

  
Despite the sunburn
and the mosquito bites and the mud

  
I actually do quite like my job

  
And I've also got a confession
to make to you all 

  
I actually quite like mosquitoes

  
(Laughter)

  
I'm quite fascinated by them

  
I think they're actually quite beautiful

  
if you get a chance to look at them
underneath the microscope

  
So before I started my research

  
and first looked through
a microscope at a mosquito

  
I don't think I'd really given them
much of a thought

  
I knew that they were involved
in outbreaks of disease overseas

  
and I was quite familiar with that smell
of a smoldering mosquito coil

  
It still reminds me of summer holidays

  
But the work I do now

  
together with that of scientists
around the country

  
is trying to work out how we can
stop people getting sick

  
because of mosquito bites

  
It requires us to understand

  
the role that mosquitoes have
in our local environment

  
and how we can change our cities

  
so that we're greening our cities

  
we're mitigating those impacts
of climate change

  
but at the same time not creating
opportunities for mosquitoes

  
Did you know there are over 
different types of mosquitoes

  
that are found in Western Sydney

  
So it's not just that one mosquito
that you slap on your arm and squash;

  
they're an incredibly diverse
and interesting range of animals

  
There's  different types
across Western Sydney

  
These mosquitoes might be big
they might be small

  
They might be black
with distinctively striped legs

  
They might be a pale brown color

  
Or they might be
a really vibrant orange color

  
But one of the things I love
about all of these mosquitoes

  
is that they're very unique

  
they've adapted to very different
types of environment

  
It’s one of the reasons that I like them
because they’re incredibly adaptive

  
But it’s also the thing
that worries me about them

  
because they could be adapting
to these sources of water

  
we're creating around our cities

  
So mosquitoes are found in an incredibly
wide range of environments

  
from coastal rock pools

  
to snowmelt streams in our Alpine regions

  
from polluted drains to pristine wetlands

  
and almost every puddle
of water in between

  
There are mosquitoes found
in all of these environments

  
And understanding how the mosquitoes
interact with these environments

  
and the climate

  
is really important to understand
how they might play a role

  
in outbreaks of disease

  
But all of these mosquitoes
essentially need two things

  
they need blood and they need water

  
So I'll get to the blood
in a little while

  
but let me talk to you about why water
is really important for mosquitoes

  
The humble mossie is a really frail
and fragile creature

  
Looks like it'll fall apart
in a strong breeze

  
It's hard to imagine these are the most
dangerous animals on the planet

  
But these animals kind of rely on water;

  
they've got an amazing life cycle
that starts in the water

  
They need water

  
So eggs are laid in and around
sources of water

  
and then when it rains
or tides come into the wetlands

  
these eggs hatch and out of these eggs
hatch these wormlike larvae

  
that swim around in the water

  
Maybe you’ve seen them in puddles
or your pot plant saucers

  
Or maybe as I did as a child

  
if you're a bit slow to clean
your backyard swimming pool

  
when warmer weather arrives

  
all of a sudden
you can see these mosquitoes

  
swimming around at the top of the water

  
But during summer
it might only take a week or so

  
for them to emerge from that water
and start flying around

  
They only live for a few weeks

  
but during that time
they can bite a lot of people

  
and they can lay
more than a thousand eggs

  
But to get those eggs they need blood

  
Mosquitoes need blood
that's why they bite

  
It's only the female mosquito that bites

  
and she needs that protein hit
in her blood to develop her eggs

  
They can live quite happily on plant
juices and sugars most of the time

  
but they really need
that blood to develop eggs

  
And the animals they can get
that blood from can be incredibly varied

  
from cows and kangaroos
to birds to frogs

  
But also us

  
And I know some of us in this room
you're probably thinking

  
"Boy mosquitoes sure like to bite me

  
more than they like to bite my friends"

  
And sometimes we can be
a bit unlucky like that

  
But it's also important to remember
that mosquitoes when they bite

  
can not only create
an itchy red lump on our skin

  
but they can also make us sick

  
They can transmit pathogens
that make us sick

  
But mosquitoes aren’t flying around

  
transferring droplets of infected blood
from person to person

  
These are not dirty syringes;

  
they’re much more complicated organisms

  
So the mosquitoes themselves
have to become infected with the pathogen

  
before they can pass that on to us

  
And when it comes
to pathogen transmission

  
not all mosquitoes are created equal

  
It's why it's really important
to understand mosquitoes

  
because even though we have dozens
of mosquitoes here in Sydney

  
that could transmit
something like Ross River virus

  
there are no mosquitoes
currently in Sydney

  
that can transmit the pathogens
that cause more serious diseases

  
things like dengue chikungunya or Zika

  
Let's hope it stays that way

  
So what does a green city
look like for a mosquito

  
So first of all there are trees
that provide shade

  
protection from wind and sun 

  
It provides these kind of protected
humid little areas

  
where mosquitoes can take refuge

  
The longer mosquitoes live

  
the more people they bite

  
the more eggs they lay

  
But it’s not so much the plants
but the water they need

  
which is really critical for mosquitoes

  
So in a green city we have water tanks

  
we build wetlands

  
We’ve got green walls and frog ponds

  
We’ve got bioretention basins

  
We’ve got rain gardens

  
All of these structures that might be
designed to store and recycle water

  
in and around our cities and suburbs

  
could be used by mosquitoes

  
Remember mosquitoes love this water
that's available to them

  
So how can we design our cities

  
so that mosquitoes aren't quick to adapt
to these types of environments

  
Wherever there's water
mosquitoes will lay eggs

  
and we have to be mindful about that
as we try to respond and green our cities

  
create the structures that will help us

  
It'll make a city greater

  
I want to live in a green city

  
I would love to live in a green city;

  
it's probably great for my physical
and mental health and wellbeing

  
I just don't want to share that
with too many mosquitoes

  
And mosquitoes are so adaptive

  
that I'm sure that they're going
to create opportunities

  
in these structures that we're building

  
and so I'm really worried

  
that we're going to see
more and more mosquitoes into the future

  
So how do you create a wetland
that's not home to mosquitoes

  
One of the really interesting pieces
of research we've found in recent years

  
is that problematic mosquito populations

  
often seem to be associated
with wetlands of poor health

  
wetlands that have more stagnant water

  
wetlands that don't have enough predators
to eat the mosquitoes

  
So it’s a tantalizing idea

  
that if you can create
a wetland that's healthier

  
it has more water flow

  
it has a greater level of biodiversity

  
you can actually keep
mosquito populations down

  
If you provide habitats
for the animals that eat mosquitoes 

  
the birds the bats
the fish the frogs the spiders

  
any number of aquatic insects
that love munching on mosquitoes 

  
rather than being a problem

  
mosquitoes are not going to disappear

  
we're not going to get rid
of mosquitoes completely

  
but if they're at a more balanced
place in the ecosystem

  
maybe we'll have fewer pest impacts

  
and more importantly

  
maybe we will see less
mosquitoborne disease

  
But what about stormwater drains

  
These are already a common sight
in our local wetlands

  
and there's a mosquito
that calls these habitats home

  
which you all already know

  
You may not notice it
when it flies past you

  
but you know its sound

  
You've probably learned to hate
the sound of this mosquito

  
more so than its bite

  
This is a mosquito called
the brown house mosquito

  
It loves breeding in polluted ponds
and pipes and waterways;

  
it's going to be quick to exploit

  
the ways in which we store
wastewater in our cities

  
The thing is about this mosquito

  
is that it loves coming indoors at night

  
It's the mosquito that's going to be
buzzing around your face at night

  
keep you awake disrupting your sleep

  
Now the reason you can hear that mosquito

  
is not because it makes a sound
that's different to any other mosquito

  
It's just that a mosquito
prefers to bite birds

  
and so it's flying
around your face and your body

  
responding to your heat
and the smell of your skin working out

  
"Is this a large featherless bird

  
I'm not sure whether
I want to bite it or not"

  
It's bad luck for those of you
who smell a bit like a bird

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's a reminder that sometimes

  
it's not just the bite of mosquitoes
that's the problem

  
it's the disturbance that can be caused
by large numbers of mosquitoes

  
And so we don't want these mosquitoes
coming inside our homes

  
where we're kind of creating opportunities
for these mosquitoes in our cities

  
So what about our backyards

  
We all want to keep our backyards healthy

  
we want to have a great opportunity
for our plants and our pets

  
and the local wildlife

  
One effective way to do that
is installing a rainwater tank

  
Problem is rainwater tanks
can be a great source

  
for very serious mosquitoes

  
You all in this room
have probably been bitten

  
by the Australian backyard mosquito

  
Its scientific name is Aedes notoscriptus

  
It is the most widespread
mosquito in Australia;

  
almost everybody has opportunities
for this mosquito in their backyard

  
Whether it's a birdbath
a pot plant saucer

  
even the smallest volumes of water
trapped in a waterholding container

  
will be a place this mosquito
can lay its eggs

  
It's a nuisance biting pest

  
but it's not a serious threat
to our health

  
But there's a problem here

  
because these same habitats
where this mosquito is found

  
could also be the home of a mosquito

  
that's associated with the transmission
of much more serious pathogens

  
pathogens that can cause
outbreaks of disease

  
such as dengue chikungunya and Zika

  
These mosquitoes
are the Asian tiger mosquito

  
or the yellow fever mosquito

  
These two mosquitoes are not found
in Sydney at the moment

  
but worldwide they contribute to major
outbreaks of mosquitoborne disease

  
They don't breed in wetlands

  
they love these waterholding
containers in our backyards

  
And as we do a better job
of creating these opportunities

  
like rainwater tanks in our backyards

  
maybe we're creating an opportunity
for these mosquitoes to move in

  
The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti

  
was actually once common in Sydney

  
but during the 's it disappeared

  
One of the reasons for its disappearance

  
could well have been the fact
that we moved away from rainwater tanks

  
And now rainwater tanks are coming back

  
They're going to become more common

  
And could that see the return
of these mosquitoes

  
I certainly hope not

  
So what can authorities do
about reducing the mosquitoes

  
associated with these greening cities
that we're dealing with

  
There's a role for our local authorities

  
to consider mosquitoes
when they're building wetlands

  
creating wastewater recycling schemes

  
regulating the installation
of rainwater tanks

  
Because these are dynamic systems

  
It's not just about
how you design them and build them

  
but it's how you maintain them

  
You can't just build them and walk away

  
because as we've learned

  
if these habitats degrade
they become more suitable for mosquitoes

  
These types of structures

  
these wetlands
in our cities they're great

  
They help reduce pollution
they help store water

  
but we don't want them to become
an opportunity for mosquitoes

  
But what about us

  
There's a role for local government
for our local authorities

  
but how an we help protect
our families and our friends

  
from the impact of mosquitoes
associated with a greening city

  
I'm going to leave you with three tips

  
that can help you stop
the bite of mosquitoes

  
and the buzz of mosquitoes this summer

  
First of all

  
don't create opportunities
for mosquitoes in your backyard

  
Anything that traps water after rainfall
will be a source of mosquitoes

  
so tip out cover up or remove
these waterholding containers

  
in your backyard

  
Screen your rainwater tanks

  
Clean your gutters and your drains

  
reduce that standing water
that mosquitoes love so much

  
around our homes

  
Secondly

  
insect repellents are a safe
and effective way

  
to avoid mosquito bites

  
When you're choosing a formulation

  
from the local pharmacy
or the supermarket

  
make sure you apply it
as a nice even coat

  
over all exposed areas of skin

  
Don't put it on like perfume

  
A dab here or there
is not going to provide protection

  
Unless you've got complete cover
those mosquitoes will find a way

  
to find that gap
in your repellent and bite

  
Lastly a way that you might be able
to stop the buzz of mosquitoes

  
Why not just switching on a fan

  
We know that operating a fan in a bedroom
can help reduce those mosquitoes

  
that come in and buzz around
our ears at night

  
It disperses the smells
and the temperatures

  
around that body that attracts them;

  
it might make it a bit harder
for that mossie

  
to fly around and find us as well

  
So finally I want to leave you
with a thought

  
We may hate mosquitoes and I understand

  
I don’t want to convert you
into loving these bloodsuckers

  
But we need to understand them

  
Because if we can’t understand
the diversity of mosquitoes

  
and their relationships
with the environments

  
we’re creating in our green cities

  
it's going to become
a much greater struggle

  
to kind of reduce the burden of disease
that might come with them

  
And unfortunately

  
mosquitoes are going to be
yet another challenge we face

  
as we move forward into our future cities

  
under the impact of a changing climate

  
As a new widow Sarah Rosas Garcia

  
was already struggling to support
her nine children

  
when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities

  
Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school

  
and being sexually promiscuous

  
so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents

  
committed her to a state hospital

  
After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score

  
the doctors made their verdict

  
They told Sara her yearold daughter
would be sterilized

  
to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency

  
This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime

  
But in fact it took place 
in Southern California in 

  
And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color

  
targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics

  
Since ancient Greece there have been
efforts to control human populations

  
via reproduction retaining some
traits and removing others

  
But in the th century the discovery
of evolution and genetics

  
inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor

  
In  British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton

  
named this idea eugenics

  
drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born”

  
This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists

  
and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society

  
by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down

  
However their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable

  
was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era

  
Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction

  
including immigrants people of color
and people with disabilities

  
Meanwhile their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members

  
white Europeans
of Nordic or AngloSaxon descent

  
As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early th century

  
many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions

  
These measures to improve socalled
“racial hygiene”

  
were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany

  
The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews

  
as well as individuals from other groups

  
including Roma gay men 
and people with disabilities

  
Outside their extreme brutality however

  
Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe

  
Throughout the midth century

  
many countries enacted eugenics policies

  
and governments in Sweden 
Canada and Japan

  
forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals

  
Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US

  
From  to 

  
US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over  people

  
with  states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization

  
for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective”

  
This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses

  
and the results of IQ tests

  
which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations

  
These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California

  
From  to  Latina women were 
% more likely to be sterilized

  
than other women

  
And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high—

  
this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations

  
Such was the case of Andrea Garcia

  
whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates

  
With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus

  
Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law

  
violated the US Constitution

  
depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law

  
However while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea

  
the other two did not

  
Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery

  
but many more victims 
of these policies did not

  
Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations

  
after the horrors of World War II

  
many of its practices including
sterilization continued for decades

  
By the late s research 
into human genetics was more nuanced

  
and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence

  
Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization

  
well into the s

  
Finally class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers

  
and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 

  
Unfortunately today

  
the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities

  
still continues around the globe

  
Anna Malaika Tubbs "The Three Mothers"

  
is about Alberta King
Berdis Baldwin and Louise Little

  
the mothers of MLK Jr
James Baldwin and Malcolm X

  
And I wrote this book

  
to not only celebrate
these three incredible life stories

  
that we should have known
for years and years before my book

  
but to also think about what their stories
could symbolize for Black women

  
Black mothers mothers more generally

  
and what it could mean
to save their stories

  
from being forgotten from being erased

  
and how it changes our understanding
of where we are as a nation today

  
how we have arrived here

  
what are changes
that we still need to make

  
Whitney Pennington Rogers That's great

  
I think in reading it

  
you can feel how really lovingly
you put all of this together

  
and did this research and the attention
that you put to this

  
this really comes through
in the finished product

  
Well we have we have
a question from Jeff

  
Jeff says that "As a father
this talk changed my life

  
I bought the book a few copies
and was in the audience in December live

  
and it generated this concern for me

  
How much history was impacted
with lack of mother's input

  
especially Black mothers”

  
And that's the question

  
AMT Oh it's a big question

  
First thank you Jeff
I really appreciate that

  
So much of our history
we are missing these stories

  
And the feeling that you felt
in being in that audience

  
and that I felt
in uncovering these stories

  
and every piece of the puzzle that I found

  
just really shocked me

  
that we didn't know these things
already and infuriated me

  
And it really caused me some deep sadness

  
because I realized
how many more stories are 

  
I mean we're missing so many

  
and of course not everybody
is going to be famous

  
and not everyone’s going to have
a book written about them

  
But it's very very unique this erasure
of Black women's contributions

  
It is very intentional

  
Like I said with "Hidden
Figures" as an example

  
why would we not know that Black women
were the mathematicians

  
called "the computers"
behind a space launch

  
That is critical information
for our history

  
And for me to think
as a young Black woman

  
when I was sitting in school

  
when I was a young Black girl

  
what that could have meant
to me to know that

  
That it was a part not only of 

  
I could not be the first Black
woman to do something

  
but that there was a history before me

  
of Black female mathematicians

  
and these brilliant brains

  
And even as much as you know

  
my parents educated me on my Black
history and my African history

  
because even I have a privilege
that many Black Americans do not have

  
I knew my connection
to my lineage in Ghana etc

  
So much of this history
has been robbed from us

  
And it's a very strategic robbing

  
It's not a mistake

  
So that just thinking
from that perspective

  
we want to continue to uncover
more and more stories

  
of those who have been
intentionally marginalized

  
intentionally oppressed

  
Because the more we can correct
our telling of that story

  
and that history

  
the better we'll do moving forward

  
So these attacks on telling history
right now it's very strategic

  
It’s not again a mistake

  
It's not something
that people are doing unconsciously

  
It’s very “We don’t want
to tell the truth”

  
And we all need to reckon with that

  
and we need to fight against that

  
WPR I think that it's really
interesting in the book

  
that you draw these parallels
between what was happening

  
in the lives of these three women

  
and what we're seeing happening you know

  
play out in the news today

  
or have seen happen at other
moments in history during their lives

  
And you know I'm curious
to hear how you think

  
writing this book changed your perspective

  
on the experiences of mothers currently

  
just how you think about motherhood today

  
AMT Yeah this is something
that I already knew was an issue

  
Going back to my mom
she would always say

  
in every place that we travel
to pay attention

  
to how women are being treated
in the society

  
how mothers very specifically
are being treated

  
That is an indicator on how successful
this community will be

  
And so I always carry that
in the back of my mind

  
I was always aware that
when I moved back to the US for instance

  
that we weren’t really giving mothers
the support that they deserved;

  
we certainly weren’t giving them
the celebration that they deserve

  
and therefore the support was lacking

  
And there was this lack of understanding

  
around the critical
importance of the role

  
But in putting this book out there
and even doing the TED Talk

  
and speaking to so many different
audiences around this

  
it is a dire situation for mothers

  
And whether that's on a personal level

  
where those who have come up
to me and said

  
“I am the mom who feels
unappreciated in my household right now”

  
“I am the mom who feels unseen”

  
To this national level of a crisis

  
where we are fighting for weeks
of parental leave

  
mere weeks

  
This is 

  
It’s upsetting

  
and we should be embarrassed by that

  
These are things that should
have been established by now

  
and I really do 
and I say this in the TED Talk 

  
I truly hope that within my lifetime

  
we can usher in a shift that starts with
first saying “Mothers are essential”

  
We need mothers to be supported

  
because they are holding
so much of our lives together

  
our society together

  
Stayathome moms are performing some
of the most important work in our country

  
and we are devaluing them

  
And not only that we are making them
feel bad about what they are doing

  
This really is an issue
that more of us need to take on

  
Going back to that very first question

  
why this is an issue
for everybody to care about

  
And it sounds obvious

  
but we shouldn't have to say
that if mothers are dying

  
in a maternal health crisis 

  
one that is exacerbated for Black women 

  
the Black maternal health
crisis is alarming

  
but generally the maternal
health crisis in the US is terrible

  
It shouldn't be this way

  
Mothers of all races are dying
more than they should be

  
We need to pay attention to that

  
That's not only bad
for mothers obviously

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to walk away
from their job during the pandemic

  
because there were no supports
in place to catch them

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to choose
between being a mother

  
or making money for their family

  
That shouldn't be put on their shoulders

  
There should be supports in place

  
We should have affordable child care

  
We should have universal preschool

  
All of these things that impact mothers
have ripple effects for the rest of us

  
So yes it opened my eyes
to just how alarming

  
and how critical a situation
we're currently in

  
Even though again my mom raised me
to know all of these things

  
Through doing this work

  
I’ve just now been kind of
awoken to the need

  
for people to open their eyes right now

  
WPR M Watson has a question
that actually kind of piggybacks on this

  
more than just thinking about how
we can gain access to these stories

  
they want to know you know

  
what do you feel is the most
effective way we can as a people

  
change the narrative around Black women

  
You know if you have
any specific examples

  
which I know you share some in your talk

  
They ask

  
"How can I personally be involved
in this work of changing this narrative"

  
AMT Great question
and there are levels to this

  
I would say definitely
understanding the history

  
of how Black women
have been treated is very important

  
So again it's a shameless plug
but read the book

  
I talk about not only these three women

  
but again many of the goals that I had

  
one of them also was to explain tropes

  
like the mammy and the matriarch trope

  
and the Jezebel trope

  
and the "welfare queen"
and the strong Black woman trope

  
What all of these have meant
in American history

  
and what their intention was

  
And that is to say that anything
Black women were dealing with

  
was their own fault

  
That with the mammy trope
that we didn't deserve necessarily

  
to be compensated for work
that we were doing

  
that we deserved to stay
within domestic work

  
and that we shouldn't necessarily
be paid what that work was worth

  
because we liked it
and we were happy to be the mammy

  
The Aunt Jemima who was smiling
and wanted to do you know

  
wanted to serve her white family
more than her own

  
The matriarch trope that Black families
have been separated from each other

  
not because of systems
that have made it so that 

  
you know mass incarceration

  
or so many other things
that I can mention

  
but instead because Black women
were emasculating their men

  
Or the Jezebel trope that justified
sexual violence against Black women

  
because that's what Black women wanted

  
they were more promiscuous

  
Even the "welfare queen"

  
saying Black women are having children
just to make money

  
So you have to understand
this is a very long

  
ugly painful history

  
that we are dealing with as Black women
day in and day out

  
And when people don’t get

  
that those are the burdens we are holding

  
years and centuries of being told
that everything that's happening to you

  
the pain you're going through
is because of you

  
and not because of policies
we've voted for

  
or the ways in which we kept you
from being elected

  
or even being able to run for office

  
or even vote

  
That's where it really begins

  
Take the time as much as you can to know
how we've gotten to where it is right now

  
and then to really have a moment
where you fully appreciate

  
the incredible resistance of Black women

  
and the ways in which
we've continued to create life

  
despite the ways that people
have tried to rob it from us

  
And the vision behind what Black women
have been able to accomplish

  
what they have imagined for this world

  
because we can't accept
the situation as it is right now

  
because that dehumanize us

  
But we have pushed this nation forward
to our vision in incredible ways

  
It's not only Stacey Abrams in Georgia

  
it's a long long history
of Black women saying

  
"We don't agree
with the system as it is now

  
So here is how we're going to
help you see the world

  
and the possibilities
from our perspective"

  
And you look at American history
from that angle

  
and it is powerful

  
There is nothing like it

  
And therefore you better understand
why we should elect more Black women

  
why we should vote for them

  
to help usher our country
and continue to do it

  
But with even more support
and even more backing

  
because without that backing
without that support

  
when Black women have been erased
and misrecognized misrepresented

  
we have still created incredible change

  
So now we're asking that we be heard

  
we be listened to

  
and that our energy no longer be spent
on explaining how we got here

  
but instead on how we can do
whatever is next and whatever is possible

  
So it’s kind of a combination
of try to learn our history

  
support us as leaders

  
put those tools in our hands
as much as possible

  
Trust us hear us believe us

  
and also stop wasting our time
on the need to explain the extra

  
when that's work
that we can do on our own

  
That kind of brings me
full circle to my research

  
being around

  
I didn't reach out to the family
until I'd done my part

  
So yeah I mean even attending
a conversation like this

  
is part of doing your part
so kudos to you all

  
We're all real starting today

  
WPR And that's doing your part
to sort to educate yourself

  
on information that already
exists out there it sounds like

  
Beyond what we could do individually
to educate ourselves

  
and make change in this space

  
what can we expect from our government

  
to do more on the national scale

  
and even thinking globally

  
What are some things
that you would like to see

  
so that we change the way
that we as a culture

  
think about Black motherhood

  
AMT For this one

  
because I'll give it quicker answer
than I have in me

  
because you can tell I like to talk
and I can go for a long time

  
But in the book

  
the concluding chapter is entirely
about what we need to do as a world

  
and what are the lessons that Alberta

  
Berdis and Louise’s lives are teaching us
about our next steps forward

  
when it comes to policy
when it comes to 

  
actually even kind of
the threelevel layer

  
that I like to talk about

  
which is the interpersonal level
is an important one

  
The conversations
that we're having with each other

  
and the stories that we're telling

  
when I you know
in the TED Talk a little snippet

  
where we have mothers who feel
like they have to be selfless

  
and that we celebrate mothers
for being selfless

  
So even around Mother's Day
we say to moms

  
"Thank you for sacrificing
everything for me

  
and for putting yourself
behind everybody"

  
And yes a lot of mothers have done that

  
and certainly if they have
we should thank them for that

  
But what we can start to do is shift
that story and that thank you

  
and say "Thank you for doing
everything you could do for us

  
And also thank you for still seeing
yourself as a human being"

  
or "for representing yourself as a human
with a full range of emotions

  
and for teaching me
about my first life lessons

  
for being my first caretaker

  
for being my first leader
for being my first teacher"

  
Those are things that I think
more accurately represent mothering

  
in a way that is sustainable for mothers

  
Where mothers aren't going to burn out

  
where we're not putting all of it on moms

  
and then reiterating it by saying

  
"Thank you for putting yourself
behind everyone else"

  
So that's on like an interpersonal level

  
I do think those conversations
can make a huge difference

  
in terms of what mothers
are even thinking is the goal

  
of what we're trying to achieve

  
and what we want to be thanked for

  
The second level of that is
you know in relationships

  
even beyond our households 

  
And I mean like you said
in terms of Black motherhood

  
very specifically

  
this burden of putting
our needs behind everyone

  
I just did a piece
for “New York” magazine on this

  
that that is further
exacerbated for Black women

  
because we have been seen
as "the mothers" of a movement

  
We're always like mothers
of something much larger

  
and not just like mothers
of our own children

  
but this weight of what's placed upon us

  
And specifically in this article

  
I'm focusing on mothers
whose children have been killed

  
whether by police officers
or neighborhood vigilantes

  
and how in these moments

  
instead of giving these moms
the space to grieve

  
we're asking them to do something
for our entire country

  
You know we ask them to speak to crowds

  
they run for office which can be a part
of their personal healing as well

  
but we interpret that as look at what
this Black woman is doing for all of us

  
rather than us thinking about what is
she going to do for her own healing

  
for her own restoration

  
So that's kind of
the extra layer to that

  
And then thinking about it
on a national level

  
what we're voting for

  
I think about what could
have helped Alberta Berdis and Louise

  
and what we still need
to this day right now

  
So to give a little bit more
information on the women

  
Alberta King had to walk
away from her job

  
because the law stated at the time

  
that married women
were not allowed to teach

  
and she'd always had this dream
of being an educator

  
She had a bachelor's degree
she had a teaching certificate

  
but when she met her husband

  
she made the decision to start a family

  
because this was like
she had to make a decision

  
And even though that law
the marriage bar is not in place now

  
what are the many ways in which
we're pushing women and mothers

  
out of their jobs

  
There are many that still exist
and we need to start addressing those

  
These are just one example
from each woman

  
If we look at Berdis Baldwin

  
she was the victim of an abusive husband
for years years and years

  
And James Baldwin speaks about this often
how abusive his stepfather was

  
But she didn't have anyone
she could really turn to

  
because especially in Black communities

  
we are so afraid of what might happen
if we call a police officer

  
and we have multiple examples of this

  
where we really needed
help and intervention

  
and then somebody ends up
being shot when they're called

  
when police officers
are called to protect us

  
So Berdis Baldwin was aware of this

  
Her children had been harassed
by police officers

  
James Baldwin tells a story
of when he was pushed into an alley

  
and he was maybe  years old
and police officers searched him

  
they were looking for someone

  
and just left him there
on his own this little boy

  
So she's not going to call them
to help her in this situation

  
So she just endures this abuse
all on her own

  
So what are systems we can think about

  
in terms of should there be
other people we can call

  
who are not police officers

  
Should there be you know

  
more support even for social workers
that could come out

  
That's something to think about
and to reflect on

  
And then as an example for Louise Little

  
I mean all three of them have
these different painful traumas

  
that they experience

  
And for Louise one of the major ones

  
is that she is put in an institution
against her will for  years of her life

  
because she was this activist
radical activist

  
who spoke up against white supremacy

  
who stands and facesoff
with the KKK literally

  
And a white male physician was sent
to her house to evaluate her

  
after her husband had been murdered

  
And he concludes that she's
experiencing dementia

  
And in his doctor's note
he says that she is quote

  
"imagining being discriminated against"

  
"Imagining being discriminated against"

  
as a Black woman

  
Black immigrant woman
living in the Midwest

  
and that is enough to put her away
in an institution against her will

  
So in terms of us thinking
about the biases

  
that Black women are facing
when they don't ask for help even

  
and people just decide they're going
to come in and evaluate them

  
especially even when they do
that they're going to be misunderstood

  
that they're going to be told
they're imagining things

  
these are things we need to address

  
So we also have to do an evaluation
of our health care systems

  
and the biases that still exist

  
So it's kind of like this endless list

  
and I definitely don't want to end
on such a heavy and hard note

  
But in that concluding chapter

  
it's called "Our Lives
Will Not Be Erased"

  
that's where I go with it is policy

  
and what we can do

  
Kind of some tangible next steps

  
WPR Well I think that's
so important and so valuable

  
And to your point of not ending
in such a heavy place you know

  
I guess how do you feel though
about the progress we are making

  
M Watson asks do you feel

  
that the Black women
narrative is progressing

  
AMT I am an optimist

  
and I often say that my optimism
lies in this incredible activism

  
that Black women have held for so long

  
and we continue to envision
new realities for this world

  
And that makes me really hopeful

  
To study Alberta Berdis and Louise
who again it's not ancient history

  
Berdis passed away in 

  
Louise passed away in 

  
So this isn't like ancient
ancient history

  
but they did face a lot of things
that I no longer face

  
as a result of their work

  
and a result of what
they were able to accomplish

  
and how they taught their children
to accomplish these things

  
and change the world

  
So I'm not the kind of person
who thinks we are stuck

  
and there is no forward progress
that we've made

  
I feel like that would be really
disrespectful to them if I felt that way

  
because they gave as much
as they could to that progression

  
and it's my turn to carry
that forward as well

  
But what I do hope is that more
people join us in this

  
and that Black women are not continuing
to have to do this on our own

  
That more people will be aware of history

  
I sound like a broken record

  
but be aware of history
so that we can move forward

  
and fight anything that tries
to keep us from telling accurate

  
and full representations
of our country's history

  
Because I think if we're aware of it
then we won't want to repeat it

  
And we have more people who will want
to be allies in this fight

  
And in my contribution to this

  
I'm just hoping I'm giving more of us
tools to join the conversation

  
and think about how we can
carry it forward

So when I was  years old

  
I was a lonely geeky girl;

  
a firstgeneration Latina growing up
in a small Midwestern town

  
where hardly anyone else
had parents who spoke with thick accents

  
But then I came across
Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy

  
“The Lord of the Rings”

  
and I fell in love

  
(Applause)

  
What a cool world of elves

  
orcs

  
and small but heroic hobbits
fighting against impossible odds

  
to defeat a powerful enemy

  
Kind of like life

  
But one thing bothered me

  
There weren’t enough
female characters in this book

  
The adventurers accompanying
the protagonists were all male

  
It made me feel left out

  
like I did in school when 

  
you’re not going to believe this 

  
when my th grade teacher told me

  
“Why are you working so hard in math

  
You should be getting a boyfriend!”

  
(Audience boos)

  
But worse it offended
my sense of fairness

  
Surely girls could have adventures too

  
So what could I do

  
I sat down with my spiral notebook

  
and I rewrote the story

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I regendered a couple
of the main characters

  
and I added new scenes

  
like one where a female hobbit
devised a clever plan

  
to foil the Balrog

  
a monster who caused the death
of one of my favorite characters

  
By reimagining Tolkien’s fantasy world

  
I was creating a place

  
where someone like me could feel at home

  
Writing my story gave me comfort

  
But it also taught me a lot
about how to write

  
I never shared that spiral
notebook with anyone

  
But what I didn’t realize then

  
was I was writing something
called fanfiction 

  
(Laughter)

  
a story based on characters
or settings from another’s work 

  
and that I was not alone

  
It was an experience I never forgot

  
And many years later

  
after I became a data science professor
at the University of Washington

  
in 

  
I met another professor named Katie Davis

  
and we sat down over lunch

  
and discussed a recent news story

  
that claimed “kids today can’t write

  
all they produce
is misspelled short texts”

  
Katie and I didn’t believe it

  
We both knew kids whose writing abilities
defied these stereotypes

  
What’s more the talented young people
we happened to know

  
all had heavy involvement
in fanfiction reading and writing

  
So this apparent contradiction
sparked our exploration

  
into one of my most enduring
research projects

  
a deep data dive

  
into the vast world of fanfiction

  
to study the impact

  
that writing these stories
could have on the writers themselves

  
and whether writing fanfiction
could actually teach kids

  
to become stronger writers

  
And what we found surpassed
anything I could have imagined

  
So let me set the stage

  
For those of you who haven’t
heard the term before

  
fanfiction

  
sometimes known
as transformative literature

  
is said by some to go back centuries

  
After all in the s

  
John Milton wrote “Paradise Lost”
using characters from the Bible

  
(Laughter)

  
But today scholars generally feel

  
that modern fanfiction
traces its origins to typewritten zines

  
written by “Star Trek” fans
in the ‘s and’ s

  
And with the growth of the internet

  
barriers to sharing
have been lowered further

  
Millions of people are writing
and sharing fan fiction

  
on a variety of websites

  
around existing plots like “Harry Potter”

  
“Twilight”

  
“Naruto”

  
“My Little Pony” 

  
(Laughter)

  
and “Pokémon”

  
and many others

  
You probably have
a teenage relative or neighbor

  
who reads or writes fanfiction

  
These stories are wildly diverse

  
and may be creative
thoughtful or hilarious

  
You might find titles like

  
“When Harry Potter
Accidentally Started a Cult”

  
(Laughter)

  
Or “Five Times Hermione Snogged Harry 

  
(Laughter)

  
And One Time She Didn’t”

  
(Laughter)

  
The sheer quantity of fanfiction
that’s been produced is astonishing

  
In the past  years alone

  
over  billion words of fanfiction
have been written

  
and posted on a single online site

  
fanfictionnet

  
which is only one
of many fanfiction hubs

  
Now compare that with the amount
of fiction written in the English language

  
that’s been traditionally published

  
in all of human history 

  
 billion

  
So this is an incredible
outpouring of creativity

  
And on this site it's written
primarily by young people

  
This site’s  million members
write in  different languages

  
and their median age is  and a half

  
Most of the authors are between  and 

  
and most are teenage girls

  
 percent identify as female

  
and interestingly

  
more fanfiction authors identify
as gender nonconforming than male

  
Authors we interviewed
told us they wrote fan fiction

  
because they love
the characters and worlds

  
And over and over again

  
they told us how much
they learned about writing

  
from participating in these communities

  
Here’s an example

  
One author told us she started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
when she had this intense crush
on a fictional character

  
(Sighs)

  
It led her to write fanfiction
with phrases like

  
“gorgeous cerulean orbs” or

  
(Laughter)

  
“manly hunks of muscle”

  
(Laughter)

  
Kind of embarrassing

  
(Laughter)

  
And she told us

  
“But reviewers were kind enough

  
to be positive about
my amateurish fangirl postings

  
mostly because they also
like this character

  
But they also pointed out
my uses of clichés and overwriting

  
As a result I learned to be sensitive
to these types of bad writing

  
Today I publish original fiction

  
and no one has ever called me out
on a florid writing style”

  
She concluded with

  
“I think if a teacher had simply
redpencilied my childish scribbles

  
I might have been so discouraged
as to never write again”

  
Another author

  
who later became our student

  
told us that she learned about spelling
and grammar while writing fan fiction

  
But she also told us

  
“When I started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
I was a queer autistic middleschooler

  
who hadn’t yet realized
I was either of these things

  
I had difficulty with social situations

  
Fanfiction communities
were a vital social and learning outlet”

  
Today she’s done something
that few undergraduates ever have

  
She’s published a first author
academic paper in a toprated venue

  
(Applause)

  
After studying many individual
writers’ stories over time

  
we came to see that these personal stories
were consistent with the data

  
The young writers’ use of words
grew more diverse

  
as they received more reviews

  
So how did these kids learn

  
and from whom

  
To find out

  
we did a deeper dive into mentoring
in fanfiction communities

  
Now we expected to find traditional
mentormentee pairs

  
older or more experienced authors
mentoring younger

  
or less experienced ones

  
But what we found
was completely different

  
We found millions of authors
and readers communicating

  
via multiple channels

  
and reviewing each other’s work

  
regardless of experience level

  
People of all ages listening to
and reviewing each other’s stories

  
This was so cool we had to give it a name

  
so we call it “distributed mentoring”

  
You can also think of it
as nanomentoring

  
Each piece of mentoring
is tiny on its own

  
but the combination of all of it
is much greater than the sum of its parts

  
A key attribute of distributed
mentoring is its abundance

  
One author we interviewed

  
who wrote both traditionally
published fiction and fan fiction

  
told us that she received
more feedback in a single week

  
on her fanfiction

  
than she did in two years
on her published novel

  
It’s a difference not only of degree

  
but also of kind

  
By itself a single comment
on a story such as “loved it”

  
is relatively meaningless

  
but hundreds or thousands
provide valuable feedback

  
Like 

  
“I like the ambiguity of your ending 

  
it leaves me feeling hopeful”

  
and others like these

  
Reviewers build on
and reference each other’s comments

  
This enables authors to piece together

  
an overall view of their writing
that’s supportive as well as constructive

  
We found only one percent of comments
constituted bullying

  
And these are anonymous

  
This is a surprisingly low number

  
as anybody who has read comments
on an internet platform knows

  
What’s more

  
we found the supportive nature
of most of these comments was critical

  
in writing development

  
One author who was Black

  
made all the characters
from a popular TV show Black

  
She got comments filled
with readers’ sense of freedom

  
and delight from reading her story

  
It not only encouraged her
to keep writing

  
it gave her the conviction
that what she was doing was worthwhile

  
And so through this research

  
Katie and I found ourselves

  
not only believing
that yes kids can be good writers

  
but also that fanfiction

  
and distributed mentoring
could be used in formal education

  
A report from the National Assessment
of Educational Progress

  
found that a whopping
 percent of US students

  
in grades eight and 
lack proficiency in writing

  
Research has shown
that adolescence is a wonderful time

  
to improve your writing skills

  
and the popularity of fanfiction
in this age group shows

  
what an opportunity there is
to use it as a learning tool

  
So here's how I'm imagining it

  
Students with similar interests
from school districts across the country

  
could be connected with one another
to get and give anonymous feedback

  
on their writing

  
It must be anonymous

  
I know this from personal experience

  
Teachers could moderate the channels
to make sure feedback was constructive

  
as well as helping students learn from it

  
If this work grew burdensome for teachers

  
hierarchical moderation could help

  
which is a system where members
themselves can report negative

  
or abusive comments

  
and volunteer moderators
from among the students could decide

  
which ones to delete

  
with teachers weighing in
only when necessary

  
This technique is used
in many large online communities

  
and lots of adolescents
are familiar with it

  
Fanfiction is a private universe
that’s become a welcoming community

  
particularly for those
from marginalized groups

  
This vast and vibrant resource

  
for kids who have something to say

  
is especially meaningful to me

  
when I contrast it
with the isolation I encountered

  
growing up Latina in the US

  
And sometimes

  
I wonder what would have been
different in my own life

  
and maybe in many other people’s lives

  
if only we could have access
to this supportive community

  
of millions of young people

  
and their distributing mentoring

  
as kids

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
The last time I addressed
this august TED crowd was in 

  
from the main stage in Vancouver

  
where I was giving my first TED Talk
on the case for having children

  
And that's where I shared the news
I had just received earlier in the week

  
that my then twoyearold
daughter Nusayba

  
was diagnosed with stage IV cancer
and needed a full liver transplant

  
So how have your past three years been

  
As you can imagine

  
our last three years have been eventful

  
However they have given me some tough

  
learned lived experiences and lessons

  
about this ephemeral thing we call hope

  
And apparently there is a huge demand
for hope right now

  
In 

  
we're all dealing with multiple crises

  
A pandemic has killed  Americans

  
there's a partial lockdown
there's disinformation

  
there's income inequality

  
the rise of white supremacy
people telling people like me

  
“Go back to where you came from”

  
We have to learn new Greek letters
every few months

  
and oh yeah there's climate change

  
But other than that
things are pretty peachy

  
And with all of that you might be asking

  
“Well then why should we be hopeful
in such hopeless times Wajahat”

  
And that is a very valid question

  
And it's a perfectly fair question

  
But hope is what allowed me to believe
that my daughter would somehow survive

  
And she did

  
And so if I may allow me to share briefly

  
three pieces of advice or lessons

  
or things that we can do

  
that gave me hope in hopeless times

  
and that I hope can help you

  
Number one

  
Tie your camel first

  
There's a great saying in Islam

  
many Muslims know this

  
that have faith in God
but tie your camel first

  
As a dad

  
I felt utterly hopeless
with Nusayba's cancer

  
I'm the dad I'm supposed to fix things

  
But I couldn't fix cancer

  
Cancer plays for all the marbles

  
It's a relentless brutal
remorseless killing machine

  
It does not care
about your vacation plans

  
It does not care about your bucket list

  
It does not care about your Netflix queue

  
It comes for everything

  
Then coronavirus

  
Awesome

  
How do I defeat coronavirus

  
A yearold middleaged
slightly overweight male with flat foot

  
It's easy to feel helpless

  
out of control adrift

  
But at the end of the day

  
try letting go of what you can't control

  
and just focus on what you can control

  
The simple stuff

  
Wear a mask

  
Get vaccinated

  
Take care of your daily chores

  
Something that makes you feel
that you have some control

  
some agency in this world

  
When it came to Nusayba

  
that meant as a dad
just to be present you know

  
building her her Lego Friends set
when she asked me to build it

  
Watching "Frozen"  times

  
then followed by "Zootopia"  times

  
then followed by "Moana"  times

  
Getting her the tasty frozen yogurt
from the hospital vending machine

  
that she loved

  
Do what you can the best you can

  
Have hope but tie your camel first

  
And then be like Elsa from "Frozen"

  
and let the rest go

  
Number two

  
invest in joy

  
Make the intention to actively invest
in this thing called joy every day

  
Almost like a workout

  
You have to commit to it

  
It has to be a discipline

  
Build and flex that muscle

  
The world does not need
more masochists or martyrs

  
It does not need more overworked
overstressed burnouts

  
New rule for 

  
You deserve to have moments of joy
even if they are fleeting

  
every day that you are alive

  
And you have to take those moments

  
you have to grab them
you have to seize them

  
I love food

  
so I learned how to cook Pakistani food

  
took my mom's recipes during lockdown

  
My kids love Lego
so that means now I love Lego

  
I love drinking chai

  
I make a cup of chai every day
it makes me happy

  
No matter how much stress or pain
or misery I was going through

  
I made sure to invest time every day

  
to invest in things and people

  
and experiences that gave me joy

  
And finally number three

  
I would recommend humbly
invest in the narrative of hope

  
because the alternative
is apathy and cynicism

  
Investing in hope is painful

  
It means opening yourself up
to the possibility of pain

  
betrayal and disappointment

  
It's easier to court cynicism right

  
You expect nothing so you lose nothing

  
But it also means you have resigned
yourself to the cheap seats

  
You are a spectator who yells out "Boo"

  
instead of being a participant in the ring
where your nose could get bloody

  
but at least you're pushing
the ball forward

  
It means choosing apathy and nihilism
which is comforting and easy

  
but also lazy and destructive

  
During Nusayba's cancer

  
I used to sit up every night
after my family went to sleep

  
and I stayed up till like
three or four am I couldn't sleep

  
And instead I imagined

  
like Doctor Strange
in "Avengers Endgame"

  
with the time stone

  
every possible scenario and outcome
just to prepare myself as a father

  
I had to emotionally prepare
for every outcome

  
So I used to imagine Nusayba dying

  
I imagined burying her with my own hands

  
I imagined making the phone call
to her grandparents

  
explaining that she had died
listening to them cry

  
I imagined living the rest of my life
like a shell of a man

  
but pretending to put a smile on my face

  
because I had a son to raise
and now a daughter

  
My wife badass that she is

  
was also pregnant
during Nusayba's cancer

  
I had to be prepared

  
But I also chose to invest in a narrative
in which Nusayba lived

  
And I imagined seeing her alive

  
with a liver transplant smiling

  
regaining her hair full of joy and life

  
I preferred that story

  
That's the story I invested in

  
even as we were sitting on the edge
of what seemed like a falling cliff

  
I decided I would put out the lawn chair
and at least enjoy the scenery

  
Over  people mostly strangers

  
chose to sign up
to be donors for Nusayba

  
even people who told me
they hated me for my politics

  
They were moved by her story

  
Sometimes some people can change

  
Sometimes some people
can choose to do and be good

  
An anonymous donor Shawn Zahir

  
decided to give a piece of his liver
to a girl he never met

  
just so she could live

  
I'm not Pollyanna

  
I'm not a foolish
wideeyed naive optimist

  
I'm a pragmatist

  
fully aware of the many challenges
and horrors we are facing

  
But through my own personal experience
if it is at all helpful

  
I can assure you that walking
through this forest of horrors

  
going on this journey
wherever it may lead

  
if you choose to invest in hope

  
it at least makes the ride
a bit sweeter and easier

  
And as the wise ram tells Po
in “Kung Fu Panda ”

  
"Your story may not have
such a happy beginning

  
but that does not make you who you are

  
It is the rest of it

  
who you choose to be"

  
Right now

  
survival is victory in this story
that we are living

  
We are alive during a pandemic

  
We are winning

  
And just for that we should be grateful

  
And I hope the choices we make
in these challenging times will

  
Inshallah God willing

  
lead to a better story for all of us

  
And I believe that begins
with choosing to invest in hope

  
during hopeless times

  
Whitney Pennigton Rogers
Thanks so much for that

  
It was really wonderful to hear

  
and I think we may even hear
Nusayba in the background

  
which is I think exciting

  
WA I'm sorry that's her
it's virtual school

  
I'm doing the best I can

  
The wildlings are right there

  
What's keeping us from the wildlings
is a very thin wall so let's pray

  
WPR I think we talked
about this before we started

  
that we're all at home right now

  
That's the thing I think we all know

  
So that's what it is

  
I think before we dive into just
talking more about what you've suggested

  
around growing hope

  
I'd love to start by talking
a little bit about your book

  
"Go Back to Where You Came From"

  
because I think that it
will provide a nice foundation

  
for sort of understanding
your thinking around this

  
and sort of how you've come
to really embrace this

  
So I guess maybe you could start first
by talking about the title of the book

  
You know it's part memoir
part historical analysis

  
part howto guide on being inclusive
and creating a place of belonging

  
How did you come up with the title

  
Why did you choose this
for the title of your book

  
WA So the title is “Go Back
to Where You Came From

  
And Other Helpful Recommendations
on How to Become American”

  
Very deliberate tongue in cheek
both ugly and funny right

  
Because I believe that's the lived
experience of life

  
But that's the lived experience
of many Americans

  
who are still trying to love a country
that doesn't love us back

  
And so how do you respond to that pain

  
And some people cry
as you can tell I laugh

  
And so this book is also an elegy

  
for the rest of us

  
who are still striving
to be coprotagonists

  
of this American narrative

  
And the book tries to expand
and stretch this country

  
to accommodate all of us

  
to become the multiracial
democracy it has to become

  
Or else I believe it'll all fail

  
And it's done with a lot
of humor and hope

  
and throughout the journey
you read the book

  
you know I talk about Nusayba's cancer

  
but there's lots of interesting
things that happen to me

  
WPR To put it mildly

  
WA Yeah my life is like a telenovela

  
like a Mexican soap opera
for better and for worse

  
And so I hope that when you get
to the end part

  
where I talk about "invest in hope
but tie your camel first"

  
the hope that I give
the audience for the future

  
I don't want it to make it a hallmarky

  
fake saccharine Hollywood ending

  
I want you to really like
I want it to be earned

  
And you know the way to earn it
is to confront the horrors

  
confront the challenges name it own it

  
Talk about the pain
wear the mileage and the scars

  
But despite all of that
you still persist right

  
And because I agree I mean

  
what I said in the speech
the fiveminute talk that I just gave you

  
I believe in it

  
I've been on all the sides
in moments of deep despair

  
I've been there of darkness of pain

  
and I realize if you tap out it's over

  
If you tap out it's done

  
And what I've seen

  
and we'll probably talk about it
because you read the book

  
in those moments in my life
where you feel like it's over it's done

  
I'm at the edge of the cliff
and I'm about to fall

  
there's been a plot twist

  
Like the the page turns

  
and with it comes like a better story

  
And so in the book
I mention there was a time

  
where I was completely broke homeless

  
my parents were in jail
I was taking care of my grandparents

  
And I’m like there’s no way
I couldn’t even imagine my future

  
I couldn't imagine
living to the age of 

  
I thought I would be dead by 

  
I’m being honest
with anyone who’s listening

  
My timeline you know I imagine a lot
like I said like Doctor Strange

  
it ended at 
I just couldn't imagine it

  
And I just knew that I would die

  
It’d be over and I almost did die

  
But here I am sitting in my home

  
married to a woman
who's way better than me

  
I married way up

  
Like hotter than me smarter than me

  
like it’s ridiculous not even cool

  
And then I got three kids
and then Nusayba who was supposed to die

  
that’s what they told me
she wouldn’t make it

  
They said every complication
against this girl is happening

  
you could just hear her
chirping right now

  
I'm sure you guys can hear her
chirping that's Nusayba

  
So you never know you never know

  
WPR We have a question
that came in from Darcy

  
where Darcy asked "The idea
of investing in hope is a great one

  
But how can we make it tangible

  
You mentioned visualization
or avoiding complaining

  
but how else can we actually
bring this to life"

  
WA It's a very good question

  
and that's where I say
tie your camel first

  
You have to exhaust yourself
of every possibility within your control

  
You know and after that
you have to let go

  
I'll give you an example
I mention it in the book

  
There was a moment
my parents were in jail

  
I'm  years old I have to leave school

  
I'm taking care of my grandparents

  
my grandmothers who used to live with me

  
I'm an only child

  
I have to care of the family business

  
I have to pay the lawyer

  
It's post/ my community
turns vicious and cruel

  
Bad news travels fast
ladies and gentlemen

  
bad news travels fast

  
I'm surgical with my budget

  
I have an Excel sheet

  
I've got to pay all the bills

  
According to my Excel sheet

  
after I withdrew the  dollars
from Wells Fargo

  
on the corner of Warm Springs and Mission

  
I was supposed to have  dollars left

  
I go to the ATM of Wells Fargo

  
I take out the  bucks
I get the receipt

  
I look at the bottom
instead of  dollars

  
it was 

  
I had  dollars 

  
I had to pay the bills pay the lawyer

  
take care of my family

  
And I swear to you at that time 

  
I mean honestly I said
“I have done everything in my power

  
I am exhausted

  
What can I do with three cents”

  
I didn't even get angry
I didn't get upset

  
I remember this vividly
it was a beautiful Bay Area day

  
anyone who lives there knows
pm little bit of a windy breeze

  
The sun was still there
it was just idyllic

  
And I remember I started laughing
look at the receipt

  
and a couple of people behind me

  
were trying to figure out
what’s wrong with this guy

  
Because I didn’t know what to do
I just chuckled I had three cents left

  
So this is what I did

  
I took the  dollars went across
the street and decided to splurge

  
I went to Subway

  
and had a Subway supersized meal

  
footlong tuna sandwich
with all the workings and avocado

  
And then I decided to have
two chocolate chip cookies

  
Then I went next door and had 
what is a Venti

  
What's the largest one at Starbucks

  
WPR I think Venti I don't drink coffee

  
WA Venti caramel frappe
with extra caramel drizzle right

  
And I had now  dollars
became  dollars

  
I went home and I told my grandmother

  
I said "I've done
everything I possibly could

  
There's nothing else I can do

  
We have  bucks left I'm sorry"

  
I had some Dal Chawal that night
watched a Netflix movie

  
And I remember I said this
in the book I let go

  
There's nothing else I could do

  
I completely let go

  
I said Allah whatever happens
Inshallah I leave it up to you

  
I've done everything within my powers

  
like everything I could possibly
think of I've done

  
This is it like
you want to save me save me

  
you don't want to save me whatever
I enjoyed my Subway meal

  
And I remember
this is really interesting

  
I had the best night's sleep that night
that I have ever had in my life

  
I remember that sleep to this day

  
I have prayed for that sleep

  
I felt like I was a baby
in my mother's womb

  
I tried to wonder why

  
It's because I knew that I did
everything within my powers

  
I exhausted myself and I let it go

  
And then what happened

  
somehow I got a loan
and  bucks came

  
And the story continued

  
And so when you're saying
about doing something tangible

  
it's not just me saying that like

  
you have to have some feeling
of control and autonomy

  
in what is a world where you feel adrift

  
and the ground is shifting
beneath your feet

  
Those small chores
that you take for granted

  
they'll give you order some discipline

  
I’m making that chai I’m painting this

  
I’m feeding my children
I took out the trash

  
I did some work today

  
I can control this
I did this with my hands

  
I'm still alive right

  
And then you plot
and you do the best you can

  
and then you let go

  
And I think those daily chores
that daily routine that you establish

  
gives you a sense of rhythm

  
at the very least says

  
"The world can take everything
but it won't take this

  
It won't take my delicious cup of chai
that I made with my own hands

  
It won't take this little plant
I plotted outside

  
It won't take my love for my kids

  
It won't take that from me

  
Not today death not today"

  
So I hope for whoever asked that question
I hope that was hopeful

The moon goddess Ix Chel patiently
watched a spider at work

  
She could make use of it skills 
she thought

  
Through careful observation and imitation
she soon became a skilled weaver

  
The sun god Kinich Ahau 
was impressed with her work

  
and admired her from afar

  
But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive

  
and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter

  
To get past the grandfather
the sun god disguised himself

  
as a hummingbird

  
As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey

  
the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather

  
to capture the bird for her

  
The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart stunning him

  
Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health

  
and soon he was able to spread his wings
and fly again

  
He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess

  
to escape with him

  
The two rowed away in a canoe

  
but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god

  
to help him stop them

  
Sensing danger the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below

  
and transformed into a crab

  
But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt

  
which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart killing her

  
Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered

  
buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings

  
They formed a thick magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body

  
For thirteen days the dragonflies cut 
cleaned and hollowed thirteen logs

  
On the thirteenth night 
the logs burst open

  
and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever

  
The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage

  
The moon goddess happily agreed

  
Sidebyside they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays

  
Unfortunately the story 
doesn’t end there

  
The sun god’s brother visited often

  
Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel 
the sun god grew jealous

  
and began to mistreat her

  
One day Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank

  
furious at her husband

  
A huge bird came gliding down

  
and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks

  
To get away from the cruel sun god
she agreed

  
There she met the king of the vultures

  
The vulture king was kind and funloving—

  
a much better partner
than the violent sun god

  
The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains

  
When the sun god heard he was distraught

  
He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down

  
then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom

  
where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king

  
He begged her to come home with him
apologizing for how he had treated her

  
The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back

  
But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again

  
He struck her scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays

  
Ix Chel flew off into the dark

  
From then on she vowed 
to appear only at night

  
She befriended the stars and combined
her pale blue rays with their light

  
to guide night travelers to safety

  
She used her healing gift

  
which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god

  
to cure people who were ill

  
Today Ix Chel is so widely known

  
that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture

  
But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya

  
Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities

  
In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists

  
the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends

  
beyond the limits 
of the historical record

  
Her story like all myths 
isn’t just one story

  
the variations ancient and modern
speak to what people value

  
and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes

  
So I come from Bosnia

  
I mean I live in Sweden now

  
but you don't need to know
my whole life story

  
But the story that I do want to share
is from my home country

  
So close to  percent
of the land in Bosnia

  
is dedicated to agriculture and farming

  
So the government
decides to support farmers

  
to set up a budget

  
to set up the requirements
for the people to receive the budget

  
and then to disburse the funds

  
So they do that and towards
the end of the process

  
they decide to analyze
who really received these funds

  
And they did that

  
and the Ministry
of Agriculture was shocked

  
because only one group of citizens
received  percent of these funds

  
And those were men
men working in agriculture

  
So where were the women

  
Why didn't they have access to the funds

  
The Minister of Agriculture was surprised
because they didn't mean to discriminate

  
They knew there were women
working in agriculture right

  
So they went back
and analyzed the situation

  
And the problem was 
well there were three things

  
The first thing is they didn't even know
the gender of farmers

  
because they'd never done
gender analysis before

  
So actually they did know
the sex disaggregation of cows

  
but not of people

  
(Laughter)

  
I will let that sink a bit 

  
because gender is unimportant

  
The second issue is that the way
they were distributing the funds

  
could not possibly reach women

  
Why Because one of the conditions
to get this subsidy

  
was to give out
a land ownership certificate

  
and we know that traditionally
women do not own land

  
And the second problem
was that women didn't even know

  
Why Because the information was shared
at forums that they do not participate in

  
But the story has a happy end
because when the ministry realized this

  
they changed these provisions

  
And with the help
of gender experts from Bosnia

  
we now see more and more women
getting funds every year

  
So what is the point of this story

  
The point is not only that we should have
sexdisaggregated data on people

  
not only cows

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's also that we can budget
fair and equitably

  
but we can't just run numbers blindly

  
We need to know the faces of the people
that we are serving with public funds

  
So this is really the heart
of genderresponsive budgeting

  
or as I like to think of it
and maybe you too

  
commonsense budgeting

  
(Laughter)

  
So I'm an economist

  
I work with public finance
so public finance and budgets

  
but my specialty is helping governments
inject a gender perspective

  
in their financial decisions and budgets

  
OK so budgets are fairly simple
straightforward

  
as it was introduced

  
and now you are thinking

  
"Well that does not look
fairly straightforward"

  
And it's intentionally done like that

  
because this is how we often imagine
the budget to be so complex

  
so technocratic bureaucratic
we don't even want to engage

  
But the reality
is very different than that

  
In fact all our budgets

  
be it your own budgets
or public budgets or company budgets

  
go through the four logical steps

  
The first step is of course
we are calculating our revenues

  
In the sense of the state
it would be taxes and fees right

  
The second step is budget approval

  
After we figure out
what we will do with the funds

  
it goes to the approval of the parliament

  
And then the third step
my personal favorite

  
is spending or budget execution

  
Ideally according to priorities 
not my personal favorite

  
And then we go into control
and budget oversight

  
So whether we have actually spent
the money as we planned

  
and also whether we have
achieved the objectives

  
So in the sense of the state

  
it would be an increased
level of education

  
decreased level of poverty

  
In the sense of the companies
it would be profit or income

  
You see where I'm going

  
So what is really wrong with that

  
It sounds perfectly logical

  
Well what is wrong with that

  
is that traditionally in most countries
if not all around the world

  
we assume when we are planning
the budget funds

  
that we are targeting one universal
homogenous human

  
that will have the same access to funds
the same needs almost

  
And then a situation such as this one
in the Ministry of Agriculture happens;

  
then we are surprised that our funds
didn't really reach everybody

  
So what I want to also say here
what do we then do about that

  
In Ukraine the government has analyzed
close to  budget programs

  
And when I say “budget programs”

  
these are expenditures
in health education sports

  
infrastructure defense 

  
anything you can think of
that is funded with public funds

  
And in every single one of these programs
we have found gender gaps

  
We have found big gender gaps

  
And these gender gaps
were usually on account of women 

  
they didn't have access

  
And why did this happen

  
It happened because finance officers
were just doing their jobs

  
and they were doing it really well

  
They were planning for economic
effectiveness efficiency

  
value for money 

  
We really love value for money

  
Performance budgeting mediumterm 

  
all of these very valid
economic objectives

  
very valid goals

  
but we really didn't account
for the needs of the people

  
that we are serving with these funds

  
And let me illustrate that

  
So we have analyzed
the program for tuberculosis

  
So treatment of patients
with tuberculosis

  
And you may be now asking

  
"OK but you know
you need to treat the patient

  
Why is gender important here"

  
But when we have done the analysis

  
we have actually seen that  percent

  
of the patients
with tuberculosis were men

  
And tuberculosis
is a big issue in Ukraine

  
And these were men living in remote areas
in rural areas working in mines

  
However the preventive measures
and the way they were designed

  
they didn't account for it

  
They were actually targeting
those sectors

  
such as education and health

  
where women traditionally dominate

  
And this is fine

  
but they really didn’t account
for the needs of the men in these groups

  
And why

  
Because gender equality was not important
in the budget decision

  
So what I'm trying to illustrate here

  
is not only that we need
to account for gender equality

  
to achieve our objectives of equality

  
but we also need to account for it to make
more commonsense budgetary decisions

  
more effective and efficient budgets

  
So how do we do that

  
It looks equally entertaining

  
but now we also add gender

  
so it's a total mess and we would think
"How do we even go about that"

  
But of course
it's not as complex as that

  
because in the heart of this work
is gender analysis

  
And what do I mean by that

  
So when we are planning
as finance officers

  
any financial or fiscal decision

  
meaning when we are planning
introducing a new tax for example

  
the core is to analyze
how will that influence

  
different groups in a society

  
So will we have
our gender gaps increased 

  
we don’t want to do that 

  
reduced or leave the status quo

  
So of course we want to reduce them

  
and I just want to put it here as well

  
in most countries 
not all unfortunately

  
but in a lot of countries
around the world

  
we have a very solid legislative framework
for gender equality

  
We have commitments

  
But when it comes to budget and finance

  
that's where suddenly
the story evaporates

  
So when it comes to money

  
it's not really analyzed
for gender impact

  
So this is really important

  
and we do this in as I said three steps

  
I will take you very fast
through these steps don't worry

  
So the first step is really
to do a situation analysis

  
So in our agriculture example

  
if we had done a situation analysis

  
and if we had known
the gender gaps in this sector

  
we wouldn't have been surprised

  
We would have known
that women do not own land

  
so we wouldn't give this as a requirement

  
and we would definitely have known
that we need to inform them

  
in a different way

  
So this is the first step

  
The second step is related to my example
with sex disaggregation

  
you will remember from the beginning

  
So we really need to know
the beneficiaries

  
that we are trying to serve

  
And now you are thinking
"This sounds very obvious"

  
but it's not done

  
And the third step of course
is to know the procedures

  
How will we give this budget out
who will have access

  
What will be the excluded groups

  
And that's it

  
And now I will just share
some good news I think

  
It's that around  countries
around the world

  
are working with gender budgeting

  
And please if you have an interest

  
just see if your own country
is one of them

  
But when I say they are working
with gender budgeting

  
that does not mean that their whole budget
is genderresponsive

  
That would be my dream

  
But my personal hero is Austria Why

  
Because they have gender budgeting
entrenched in the constitution

  
So that means that in Austria

  
it cannot happen that you have
an investment project

  
that you are doing
without considering gender

  
and gender equality

  
Canada  feminist government
genderbalanced cabinet 

  
and they are doing gender budgeting

  
but they are taking into account
the needs of Indigenous groups of people

  
So this is also something
that we want to do

  
and we have to do

  
Let me take you to Morocco

  
Morocco is working with gender
budgeting for  years

  
Indonesia with the help
of the World Bank

  
has just analyzed
their whole budget system

  
to make it more genderresponsive

  
And I need to take you again to Bosnia

  
because I did start with that example

  
Balkan countries are doing fantastic work
with the help of UN Women

  
So there is a lot of work happening

  
and I am now coming to an end

  
because you might now be wondering

  
"OK but what is in it
for me" in a sense

  
"You are talking about public budgets

  
but I work in a company or NGO
or I'm selfemployed" doesn't matter

  
So what is it Why is it important for us

  
Because this is our money

  
These are our budgets

  
We are filling these budgets 

  
it's not some abstract money out there

  
so we have the right to demand it
to be equitable to be fair

  
That's one thing

  
So it is important for countries
it's important for companies

  
Of course we should ask
who is making decisions

  
whose needs are being satisfied

  
And also maybe families

  
But who really has the voice
who is making decisions

  
It's interesting just to see
and then to maybe be surprised

  
that these ministries are not

  
So if you are interested
you are literally one click away 

  
and I'm aware this sounds
like a sales pitch

  
but I am selling you the work of many
many genderbudgeting experts

  
around the world

  
who have been for years
working with these concepts

  
So you have such a wealth of material

  
from UN Women IMF different scholars

  
World Bank Swedish government 

  
doesn’t matter I will not go
into all the wealth of materials

  
So it's all out there

  
And if we do that
we will have the budgets

  
that will not only lead
to gender equality

  
which is an amazing objective in itself

  
but we will have better more effective
more efficient more fair budgets

  
What's not to like

  
So I hope next time we meet
maybe here again

  
this type of genderresponsive budgeting
will be called "budgeting"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
So when I was born on September  

  
my grandparents and great
grandparents back in India

  
didn't find out for two weeks

  
which is a shame because I mean
look how perfect I was

  
(Laughter)

  
And it's not because the phone
lines were down

  
or because they weren't available

  
It's because there was
a complication with my birth

  
And that complication
was being assigned female at birth

  
You see because my mom had been told
that if she gave birth to a daughter

  
it wasn't worth phoning home about

  
After all she’d already given birth
to my older sister

  
and this time everyone had high hopes
that she would do right and have a son

  
But she didn't

  
She had me

  
And so there were no congratulations
or Indian sweets sent our way

  
Just the reality that from the moment
I came into this world

  
I was already a disappointment
to so many people

  
It's as if they had a time machine

  
and already knew the trajectory
of my entire career and life

  
and decided that I had less to offer

  
And it sucked

  
So why am I telling you this heavy story

  
I'm supposed to be a funny person

  
I have the nerve to come out here
and hit you right in the feels

  
How dare I

  
I'm telling you this because although
this is my lived experience

  
it's also the reality
that millions of girls face every day

  
across every culture and in every country

  
And I'm telling you this
because being born into this reality

  
set me on a lifetime mission
of trying to prove myself

  
and just feel like I was enough

  
What did I want to be when I grow up

  
I wanted to be treated equally

  
And I'm not alone in this mission

  
In fact us girls
what we desperately want

  
is a seat at the table

  
It's what every motivational poster
Tumblr post Instagram account you follow

  
business card tells us

  
Success is a seat at the table

  
And if they want to be extra spicy

  
they say "If there is no seat
drag your own seat"

  
I'm sure you've heard this right

  
And so my marching orders were clear

  
Get a seat at this coveted table
by any means necessary

  
And that's been the driving force
behind my entire career

  
Now in 

  
I noticed that no one
on YouTube looked like me

  
There was no South Asian woman
who's very loud and uses her hands a lot

  
giving her take on the world

  
There was no me in front of a camera

  
I saw a seat up for grabs

  
So I got to work and I started a channel
under the name “Superwoman”

  
Yeah because although
I’m smart enough to do a TED Talk

  
I'm not smart enough
to understand copyright

  
(Laughter)

  
I taught myself how to write

  
shoot and edit my own content

  
And I worked really hard

  
When I finally got the hang of it

  
I committed to posting
two comedy videos a week

  
And I found success

  
With a backwards snapback on my head

  
I gave my take on relationships
pop culture taboo subjects

  
and most popularly
dressed up like my parents

  
(Laughter)

  
I can't tell you how many times
I forgot to wipe that chest hair off

  
A lot of times

  
(Laughter)

  
Now fast forward to 

  
and I'm on stage in India
announcing my first world tour

  
As fate would have it

  
the day after this monumental milestone

  
I was set to fly to Punjab India

  
to visit my grandfather
for the first time in my adult life

  
And whoo nothing could have prepared me

  
for what was about to happen

  
I vividly remember it

  
I was in the car driving to his house

  
He was standing outside

  
I nervously got out of the car
walked up to him

  
He walked up to me
looked me right in the eyes

  
and he raised his hand

  
and decorated me with a flower garland

  
a gesture fit for people of importance

  
He then proceeded to welcome me
into his home my mom by my side

  
and proceed to show me
all the newspaper clippings he had saved

  
with my name and face on them

  
He said the words he was wrong

  
Words I had never heard
a man say before to me

  
He said that I had done
what no one else could have done

  
and I had made the family name proud

  
Me Lilly the baby born a girl

  
That's right

  
Now in that moment
I truly felt like Superwoman

  
I did

  
You know through my YouTube videos

  
I've amassed almost  million subscribers
and three billion views

  
But more important than all of that

  
I managed to change one view

  
I challenged my grandfather's
entrenched gender beliefs

  
And for the first time in my life
I remember thinking in that moment

  
“Oh I finally got
a seat at the table ”

  
Hello props

  
(Laughter)

  
"  alongside the men in the industry”

  
I felt like that

  
And encouraged
by my grandfather's approval

  
I became more confident in my influence

  
I remember thinking "Oh I'm going
to talk at this table

  
I'm going to join
the dinner conversation"

  
You know a lot of my male mentors
make comments and posts

  
about box office numbers
and salaries and titles

  
and those dollar dollar bills

  
So I thought

  
I'm going to chime in here

  
I learned very quickly
that whenever I spoke of money

  
people got a little uncomfortable

  
Like the time I pointed out the gender gap

  
in the Forbes list for online creators

  
a list I'd previously been on

  
I remember wanting to start
a critical conversation

  
because I saw this article
and I was heartbroken

  
You know the digital space
had always been a place

  
that I thought was without gatekeepers

  
And here it was looking
just like old Hollywood

  
Well let me tell you
the internet was not interested

  
I don't know how it's possible

  
but it literally felt as if Twitter
leaped through my screen

  
and body slammed me onto my desk

  
The message was clear

  
you can be on this list

  
but don't try to start any conversations
about the inequality on this list

  
I have thousands and thousands of videos

  
One of my most disliked videos
is why I’m not in a relationship

  
Yeah

  
A lot of the men at the table
did not like me telling them

  
why I didn't need a boyfriend

  
I quickly learned

  
that there’s an invisible
gatekeeper called culture

  
and the table is smack dab
in the middle of it

  
Now in 

  
I made history with my latenight show

  
“A Little Late with Lilly Singh”

  
Thank you thank you

  
(Applause)

  
There I was Lilly
the baby born a brown girl

  
rubbing elbows or at least time slots

  
with comedy royalty

  
And I got to give a huge shout out to NBC

  
for boldly trying to break
latenight tradition

  
I remember when the show came out

  
I remember all the articles
because they looked practically identical

  
"Bisexual Woman of Color
Gets LateNight Show"

  
I almost legally changed my name
to "bisexual woman of color"

  
because that's what people
called me so often

  
And you know as strange
as that sentiment was I thought OK

  
the silver lining is that we'll finally
get a different perspective in latenight

  
A little bit of melanin a dash of queer

  
a different take on things

  
Let's do this!

  
And I remember thinking

  
"Now oh now I've been invited
to the big table

  
And now things will be different"

  
So I took my seat

  
Now unfortunately

  
the budget wasn't based
on the importance or significance

  
or historic nature of the show

  
It was based on the am
timeslot that we had

  
So to say the budget was small

  
the writing staff even smaller

  
and to do the first season

  
I had to shoot  episodes
of latenight television in three months

  
Audience Whoo

  
LS Whoo is right

  
To put that into perspective

  
that is shooting two
to three episodes a day

  
versus the network standard of one a day

  
maybe two on Thursday

  
We did it all with a writing staff
of about half a dozen writers

  
versus the network standard
that's about double that

  
Words cannot explain
to you how exhausting

  
emotionally and spiritually
challenging that was

  
And I started to feel like

  
"Hm I think this chair's
a little wobbly"

  
Now I think we can all agree

  
that the beauty and magic
of latenight is its timeliness

  
You know that no matter
what's happening in the world

  
you can turn on latenight television
and hear all about it

  
But when you shoot  episodes
in three months

  
you kind of lose that magic

  
I was the only show talking about
hooking up partying cuddling traveling

  
in front of a live audience
during a literal global pandemic

  
Now still I thought

  
if the budget doesn't celebrate
the historicness of the show

  
then the creative can

  
I can bring some much needed
spice to latenight

  
And sometimes I was successful

  
But other times

  
I would receive notes like

  
"Don't be so loud"

  
"Don't be so big"

  
"Don't be so angry smile more"

  
And my all time favorite

  
"Don't overindex
on the South Asian stuff"

  
After all everyone else at the table
who's been sitting there for years

  
people are used to them

  
I might be a little jarring to audiences

  
Now during season two of my show

  
I remember I went into overdrive

  
I found all the loopholes
I did all the necessary jobs

  
to try to make the show more timely

  
And I was excited to

  
And I felt compelled to
because for the first time in history

  
we had a woman not to mention
half South Asian woman

  
become vice president
of the United States

  
Now we witnessed one of the greatest
protests in human history

  
with the farmer protests in India

  
And I was excited to finally give
my take on these things

  
But my take was almost never included

  
in topical media news coverage roundups

  
You know we still got the same voices

  
the same perspectives

  
even though someone
and something different

  
was literally in the next time slot

  
I kept trying to pull up my seat

  
I kept trying to join
the dinner conversation

  
I kept trying to ask
for a more supportive seat

  
But every time I would be told

  
that I should be grateful
to have a seat in the first place

  
After all everyone else
that looks like me

  
is still waiting outside
the restaurant in the cold

  
You know the strange thing
about having a wobbly seat

  
is that you spend so much time
trying to keep it upright

  
that you can never bring
your full self to the table

  
So now why am I telling you all this

  
Well because my therapist
costs  dollars an hour

  
and this is way cheaper

  
(Laughter)

  
But also because I just experienced

  
one of the most notorious boys' clubs ever
in latenight television

  
And I'm here to offer solutions

  
I don't always follow up
a venting session with solutions

  
but when I do it’s a TED Talk

  
(Laughter)

  
That's right

  
(Applause)

  
You see my goal was always
a seat at the table

  
It's what women are conditioned
to believe success is

  
And when the chair doesn't fit

  
when it doesn't reach the table
when it's wobbly

  
when it's full of splinters

  
we don't have the luxury
of fixing it or finding another one

  
But we try anyways

  
We take on that responsibility
and we shoulder that burden

  
Now I've been fortunate enough
to sit at a few seats

  
at a few different tables

  
And what I've learned is
when you get the seat

  
trying to fix the seat
won't fix the problem

  
Why

  
Because the table was never built
for us in the first place

  
The solution

  
Build better tables

  
(Applause)

  
So allow me to be
your very own IKEA manual

  
I would like to present to you
a set of guidelines

  
I very eloquently call

  
“How to Build a Table that Doesn’t Suck”

  
(Laughter)

  
I've been told I'm very literal

  
Now right off the bat let me tell you

  
this assembly is going to take
more than one person

  
or group of people

  
It's going to take everyone

  
Are you ready Should we dive in

  
Let's do it

  
Up first

  
don't weaponize gratitude

  
Now don't get me wrong
gratitude is a great word

  
It's nice it's fluffy
a solid  points in Scrabble

  
However let's be clear

  
Although gratitude feels warm and fuzzy

  
it's not a form of currency

  
Women are assigned  percent more work

  
and spend more time on unrewarded

  
unrecognized and nonpromotable tasks

  
Basically what this means is

  
all the things men don't want to do
are being handed to women

  
and a lot of those things largely include
things that advance inclusivity

  
equity and diversity in the workplace

  
So hear me when I say

  
a woman shouldn't be grateful
to sit at a table

  
She should be paid to sit at a table

  
(Applause)

  
Especially ones she largely helped build

  
And a woman's seat shouldn't be threatened
if she doesn't seem "grateful" enough

  
In other words corporations

  
this step involves a woman doing a job

  
and being paid in money
opportunity and promotion

  
not just gratitude

  
And women  yeah go ahead
live it up live your life

  
(Applause)

  
And women a moment of real talk

  
trust me I've been there
and I know it's so tough

  
but we have to understand
and remember that being grateful

  
and being treated fairly
are not mutually exclusive

  
I can be grateful but still know
exactly what I deserve

  
And that's the way to do it

  
(Applause)

  
Up next invest in potential

  
When investing in women

  
don’t invest in the am time slot

  
Invest in empowering something different

  
Invest in a new voice

  
Give them the support they actually need

  
Cultural change takes time and money

  
Heck it took my grandfather  years
to see that I was worthy of more

  
So a true investment is one
that values potential over proof

  
Because so often that proof
doesn't exist for women

  
Not because we aren't qualified

  
but because we haven't been
given the opportunity

  
In other words

  
if you're trying to be inclusive

  
don't give someone new
a seat made of straw

  
until they prove
they deserve a better one

  
Don't hold something
called a "prove it again" bias

  
which requires less privileged people
to constantly keep proving themselves

  
even though white men tend to get by
on just their potential

  
Give them a seat that they can thrive in

  
that they can do the job
you hired them to do in

  
Allow them to contribute to the table

  
and they will make it better

  
Up next this is my favorite one

  
My favorite one it's quite
common sense actually

  
Make space for us

  
You know for every three men at a table

  
there's only one
place setting for a woman

  
People are so used to more men
showing up that they plan for it

  
There's an extra seat in the corner
there's a steak under the heat lamp

  
When more men show up
the table gets longer

  
But when that extra RSVP is a woman

  
more often than not

  
she's encouraged to compete
against the only other woman

  
that was invited to the table

  
Instead we need to build
multiple seats for multiple women

  
not just one or two

  
so that women are not sitting
on top of each other's laps

  
fighting for one meal

  
We already know that more
diverse teams perform better

  
A recent study shows

  
that corporations that have
more gender diversity

  
on their executive teams

  
were  percent more likely
to experience above average profitability

  
And more racially diverse companies
had  percent more profit

  
So really no matter how you look at it

  
it's time to build
longer tables and more seats

  
And I want to say something

  
and I want to admit something
I want to be vulnerable for a second

  
Because I've fallen victim
to this so many times

  
and women let me know
if you've experienced this

  
We have to get rid of the scarcity mindset
and champion each other

  
you know because I've learned
what's the better win

  
Me sitting at a table

  
or us sitting at a table

  
Don't be convinced to fight for one spot

  
Instead fight for multiple spots

  
(Applause)

  
And let me lead by example
right now and say

  
I know there’s many other women
that are going to come on this stage

  
and I hope they all nail it
and I will be cheering you all on

  
because we can all win

  
And I'm going to be your biggest
cheerleader when you're up here

  
(Applause)

  
Last it's time to upgrade the table talk

  
Now I believe stories
make the world go around

  
You thought it had something
to do the solar system

  
Joke's on you it's stories

  
(Laughs)

  
Stories are how we understand ourselves

  
how we understand others
and how we understand the world

  
And arguably the most important stories
are those we see in the media

  
Because we’ve seen time and time
that they control the narrative

  
and impact culture

  
Now when it comes to genre

  
you can argue that certain genres
have certain target demographics

  
When it comes to the world news
the target demographic is the world

  
and we know half of the world is female

  
Yet women and girls make up only
a quarter of the people interviewed

  
or that the news is even about
in the first place

  
Instead when it comes to issues
that impact women

  
we not only need to be included
in the coverage

  
we need to be driving those stories
and dimensionalizing our own experience

  
Inviting everyone in on the table talk
isn't just a nice gesture

  
It makes for better more productive
smarter conversation

  
with more than one point of view

  
And that's how you get better

  
So this all sounds like a lot of work

  
And it is

  
But I'm going to tell you
why it's necessary and worth it

  
To be honest this is about so much more
than just women in the workplace

  
In fact I could probably come up
with many more guidelines

  
across many other industries

  
This is about creating a world
where half of the population can thrive

  
You see because the work we do today

  
can create a world
where future generations of girls

  
can have equitable access and opportunity

  
And here's the best part
Are you ready for it

  
Everyone listening today
all the men the women

  
everyone in between the big companies
the small ones the media outlets

  
the people that snuck
into the back all of you

  
you can help create this future

  
A future where we have longer tables

  
and more seats that actually work

  
instead of fighting for a seat
at the old ones that don't

  
A future where everyone
is seated at the table equally

  
And a future

  
where being assigned female at birth
is not a disappointment

  
or a disadvantage

  
because girls are encouraged

  
empowered and expected to do great things

  
And I can't wait to make that a reality

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Growing up in a workingclass town
in upstate New York

  
I was taught to hope for a future
with a husband and two kids

  
How about you

  
I saw women in my community
marry as a path to economic security

  
but often end up with discontent
and even abuse instead

  
As I got older

  
I came to wonder and I ask you now

  
What is family

  
What do we want family to be

  
The nuclear family has been the basis
for our cultural stories and our laws

  
But only about half
of US adults are married

  
Fewer every year

  
Forty percent of US adults
don't live with a romantic partner at all

  
As of 

  
less than half of US children
had two married heterosexual parents

  
in their first marriage

  
The majority of us are not in a nuclear
family with a spouse and kids

  
Yet somehow

  
we treat this majority of people
like social failures

  
What’s worse

  
our laws treat unmarried people
as lesser citizens

  
Marriage comes with over  rights
and benefits under federal law

  
These include the ability
to get your spouse citizenship

  
share health insurance
get better tax rates

  
and inherit taxfree at death and more

  
Part of the winning argument
for samesex marriage

  
was that we shouldn't deprive gay couples
of all of these essential benefits

  
But I ask you

  
why should anyone be denied benefits
because they're in a romantic relationship

  
of which some people disapprove

  
Or because they're single

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
Or because they're basing family

  
on something other
than a romantic relationship

  
like coparenting a child

  
Our laws should move away from the idea
that there's one ideal family form

  
and value all families as they exist

  
(Applause)

  
That's what I've dedicated my career to

  
and today I'll share some of my visions

  
for how we can change US laws
to benefit all families

  
but also how an expansive view of family

  
will strengthen all
of your own relationships

  
For nearly  years with my law firm
for LGBTQ and nonnuclear families

  
I've supported same sex couples

  
But also the many family
forms beyond marriage

  
like platonic partners
who are raising a child together

  
or sharing finances
without a romantic relationship

  
Or grandparents who are raising
their grandchildren

  
Or a lesbian couple
coparenting with a male friend

  
Or polyamorous partners

  
who might be in a committed
relationship of three or four

  
Within that legal advocacy

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
and then help them design
their own family agreements

  
With the nonprofit
organization I founded

  
Chosen Family Law Center

  
I advocate for changes in US laws

  
to benefit this whole beautiful spectrum
of family constellations

  
And it is my core belief
that no matter how you form family

  
actively discussing
how we intend to live together

  
is the best thing we can do to strengthen
our own personal relationships

  
So how did we end up with this current
US emphasis on nuclear family

  
Most of us throughout history have lived
in large extended family networks

  
and  percent of the world
population does today

  
The nuclear family is actually
a relatively new development

  
It emerged in the industrial revolution

  
to support a working dad
and a homemaker mom

  
It peaked in the s and 's

  
but it hasn't been the most common
family form before or since

  
Still somehow it's the basis
for our health insurance system

  
How well is that working out

  
And a reason for our lack
of affordable childcare in this country

  
We still build and zone suburban homes
with this fictional family in mind

  
In Western Europe where I live
and in many other countries

  
states provide support
for citizens in need

  
including parents who are home
with young children

  
such as paid maternity leave

  
and financial support throughout
the childhood if needed

  
But in US law

  
we make sure that financial safety net
happens between spouses

  
rather than between citizen and state

  
US marriage is a social
welfare state of two

  
I'd rather a different social
welfare state personally

  
This leaves many people especially women

  
stuck in unhealthy relationships

  
So at this point

  
we can evaluate how samesex partnership

  
when we move into that movement
for same sex marriage

  
there was really an emphasis

  
on whether we should be
pushing for gay marriage

  
so that gay people could get
the benefits of marriage

  
or whether we should be working
to protect the rights of the unmarried

  
And we can do both

  
It's time now to protect
the rights of unmarried people

  
and other kinds of family constellations

  
(Applause)

  
Because the reality is
there's no evidence

  
that the nuclear family model
is actually the best one

  
Research has consistently shown

  
that children need stability
of parental figures

  
But from what I've consistently found

  
it doesn't matter
if that stability is mom and dad

  
two dads mom and grandma

  
or three polyamorous partners

  
So this is not only about justice

  
This is about what's best for children

  
If we really want that stability for kids

  
we need to provide support for all
the kinds of families that kids are in

  
rather than try and fail

  
to push people into a nuclear family model
with government benefits

  
It's time to observe
what's not working and change course

  
My definition of family

  
is people who are committed
to be there for each other

  
no matter what

  
This includes chosen family

  
regardless of biological relationship
or legal marriage

  
Many Black families in the US
have chosen aunties and uncles

  
with no blood relation

  
but a decision to be family
and a commitment to the children involved

  
Countless LGBTQ people
create chosen family

  
when they're rejected
by their family of origin

  
or when wanting to create
families that share their values

  
I am one of those queer people
to find home with chosen family

  
I grew up in a Christian family
in a small town

  
the only child of wonderful older parents

  
When I came out as bisexual

  
then as polyamorous
then as gender nonbinary

  
most of my blood relations
and over  cousins stopped talking to me

  
That's pretty standard

  
When I was a broke something
starting my law practice

  
I was diagnosed with cervical cancer

  
And realized that I'd been duped
into buying a health insurance

  
that didn't cover cancer

  
I was in a desperate
lifethreatening situation

  
And while my parents were loving

  
they couldn't provide me
with material support or problemsolving

  
So I broke through my shame
and my embarrassment

  
about asking for help

  
And I reached out
to my communities of friends

  
And I discovered that they were eager
to more actively support one another

  
They made a schedule

  
so there was always
someone there to cook to clean

  
to make phone calls
about my health coverage

  
or just sit with me while I cried
in my grief and my fear

  
When I won my appeal to receive coverage
by the Cancer Services Medicaid program

  
the administrator called and said

  
"I don't know who you are
but a lot of people love you"

  
(Applause)

  
And then she said "And I'd like them
to stop calling my office now please

  
Let them know you got coverage it's done

  
Thank you"

  
(Laughter)

  
The chosen family who stepped up for me

  
probably saved my life

  
But they wouldn't necessarily be able
to visit me in the hospital

  
or cross a border
in a pandemic to be with me

  
Because relationships beyond blood
and beyond marriage

  
often don't get those rights

  
And since then my life's work
has been to change that and I will

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
When we embrace the idea of chosen family

  
our own free will is more important
than biological connection

  
We can choose to create
family relationships

  
with the people who provide us
with the meaningful support

  
that we need and deserve

  
Samesex parenting has also advanced
the concept of family beyond biology

  
because in a same sex couple

  
only one parent's providing
the sperm or the egg

  
In my familybuilding legal work
with these families

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
before designing that legal agreement

  
For example

  
I’ll often work with a female
samesex couple

  
who has a male friend
who wants to "help" them become parents

  
So I'll facilitate discussions
to make sure they're all clear

  
on whether he's going to be
a coparent or a sperm donor

  
and design a legal agreement either way

  
Without that I've seen
too many situations of ambiguity

  
Where mom calls him a dad
when she needs childcare help

  
but a donor when it comes time
to make a big decision

  
she doesn't want his input on

  
He calls himself dad
when the baby's adorable at the park

  
but feels more like a donor
when the school bill comes you know

  
When we're designing our own families

  
we need clear written agreements

  
especially if children are involved

  
Let's say I have two clients
Sharon and Bill

  
best friends who are considering
becoming coparents

  
Sharon's turned 

  
and hasn't found the right man
with whom to marry and have kids

  
Neither has her gay bestie Bill

  
who can’t afford the $
surrogacy process by himself

  
So they call each other their Plan B

  
I would facilitate discussions with them
about their parenting values

  
their plans to share
finances for the child

  
their ideal week of childcare split

  
But the conversation
often gets more difficult

  
when I ask questions like

  
"Are you willing to live in the same city
for the next  years

  
to each be near the child"

  
We're used to the idea
of sacrificing for a spouse

  
and saying "no" to a dream job
in a different city

  
to stay close to each other

  
But it's a shocking idea
to do that for your buddy

  
But by becoming coparenting partners

  
they need to elevate their level
of commitment from friends

  
to platonic partners

  
They need to consciously say “goodbye”
to a Prince Charming fantasy

  
and welcome and embrace a new reality

  
of a beautiful partnership
grounded in their longterm friendship

  
and agree that this coparenting
relationship will come first

  
I have found in my work

  
that these kinds of discussions
are much more powerful

  
for preventing future disputes
than any written contract can be

  
We need to have these conversations

  
Legal contracts are sometimes written
to avoid looking eye to eye

  
and coming to agreement

  
But family contracts should only
be written after you've done that

  
When I design relationships

  
for polyamorous triads of three
or quads of four

  
I sometimes use existing legal structures

  
like trusts or LLCs

  
that allow you to share
property and finances

  
without a question
as to your relationship

  
So for example if I've got
a polyamorous triad

  
Ayesha Susan and Linda

  
I can set up an LLC for them

  
so that they can coown
real estate properties

  
pay taxes together

  
purchase a common health insurance

  
and have clear
exit strategies if they wish

  
(Applause)

  
And if people trust each other enough

  
to pool their financial fortune
and want to pay taxes together

  
it shouldn't matter
whether they're business partners

  
siblings or romantic partners

  
All of those families are valid

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
We should be able to choose legal partners

  
beyond a single romantic
partner like a spouse

  
Some people are doing that now

  
and it's the trend for the future

  
Domestic partnerships have been used
for  years by samesex couples

  
but also by best friends and siblings

  
Doing so as domestic partners
allows you to share your health insurance

  
to visit each other in the hospital

  
and across borders
in a pandemic like spouses

  
But unlike spouses you don't become
a social welfare state of two

  
which can be a good thing

  
I had a client who had
a severely disabled sister

  
By becoming domestic partners

  
she was able to put her sister

  
on her excellent
health insurance coverage

  
Why would a sister be any less worthy
of that than a boyfriend

  
Right

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
We've built on that history

  
In  my organization
helped pass the first laws

  
for multipartner domestic partnership

  
which have passed
in several cities and counting

  
This means that three
or four polyamorous partners

  
could become domestic partners

  
or two or more platonic coparents

  
or any two three or four people

  
who want to become
each other's legal partners

  
When relationships
have legal status like this

  
it reduces discrimination and promotes
social acceptance and awareness

  
as we saw in the samesex
partnership movement

  
Still we hope this year to pass

  
the first family status
nondiscrimination laws

  
at city levels across the United States

  
which means that you
can't be discriminated against

  
you can't be fired from your job
or denied housing

  
because of your family configuration

  
(Applause)

  
In future

  
I propose that we move from these
citylevel domestic partnerships

  
to statelevel multipartner
domestic partnerships

  
and then federal recognition

  
as we did with samesex marriage

  
And if we really want
to value families as they exist

  
rather than incentivize marriage

  
I also suggest that we separate out
some of the legal perks of marriage

  
so that single people and other kinds
of families get these benefits

  
without an evaluation of whether
they're in a romantic relationship

  
that passes muster

  
And marriage should not be the gateway
to social and economic privilege anymore

  
That time is done

  
And marriages will be stronger
when we do that

  
Do you know anyone who got married
faster than they should have

  
for health insurance or citizenship

  
Because I know too many
and I’m a divorce lawyer

  
(Laughter)

  
As a divorce lawyer
relationships last longer

  
when we marry for better reasons
than government perks

  
So many of you may be married

  
and may not think that these issues
have personal relevance for you

  
But I ask you to reflect

  
Could your relationship be stronger

  
if you adopted a more
expansive view of family

  
Marriage and partnership
are not onesizefitsall

  
Every couple in partnership benefits

  
from actively deciding how they want
to cocreate together

  
in terms of coparenting shared finances

  
your household

  
and your definition of monogamy

  
For example

  
is there any hidden expectation
that you have with your partner

  
that would benefit from being
spoken out loud and confirmed

  
I bet there is

  
Or is there any aspect of partnership
that you participate in

  
just because everyone does it

  
like sleeping in the same bed
or only vacationing together

  
that just isn't really working
for your partnership

  
When we expect any one relationship
in our lives to meet most of our needs

  
we may be putting too much pressure
on that relationship

  
And whether it's your romantic partner
your parent your adult child

  
your relationship may be stronger

  
if you also strengthen
other connections in your lives

  
and find other ways to get
some of your own needs met

  
(Applause)

  
My husband does not want
to help me process

  
I have other people for that in my life

  
So 

  
I think it's worthwhile to question

  
no matter what kind of family
configuration you're in

  
whether you could be part of a movement
for greater interconnectedness

  
beyond our romantic relationships
and beyond the walls of our home

  
Your family and your community
will be stronger when you do

  
Is there a longterm friend
that you could reach out to

  
with whom you'd like to be better in touch

  
and suggest a regular date
for a special time together

  
Could you create a childcare cooperative
with other parents in your community

  
Is there a single parent
or elderly person in your life

  
whose home you could spend more time in

  
At some point in a long life

  
you too will need support

  
And it benefits you
to practice asking for support now

  
and actively caring
for people in community

  
who may one day care for you

  
A baby whose diaper you change
may one day change yours

  
(Audience murmurs and laughs)

  
Sorry

  
It's the beautiful reciprocity
of human relationship

  
And in my vision for the future

  
while we work together
to redefine family in law

  
we can all redefine family
in our own culture and lives

  
There may even be a close friend
to whom you get the courage to ask

  
Do you want to make family with me

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
In the s American industrialist 
Henry Ford had one overwhelming obsession

  
soybeans

  
He extracted their oil to make enamel 
for painting his cars

  
He crushed them into powder
to make plastic parts

  
And he encouraged American farmers 
to grow as much of the plant as possible

  
But he wasn’t just feeding soy 
to machines

  
At the Chicago World’s Fair
he hosted a soycentric feast

  
The ingredient had been a staple
in Asian cuisine for centuries

  
but Ford’s dinner— full of soy substitutes
for dairy meat and wheat—

  
took the integration of soy
into food a step further

  
Today soy is in so many foods 
that most people consume it every day

  
without even knowing it

  
So what makes soybeans so versatile

  
And is our global obsession
healthy or harmful

  
Soybeans have been cultivated in Asia
as early as  years ago

  
but since then they’ve spread 
across the globe

  
Part of soy’s success is that 
the crop can be grown easily and cheaply

  
in variable conditions

  
And once they’re grown

  
soybeans have an incredibly high density
of proteins and fats;

  
ingredients which in recent years
have been used in everything

  
from mayonnaise to biodegradable plastic

  
The ideal method
for separating these components

  
depends on what you’re trying to extract

  
To isolate soy proteins dehulled beans 
are sometimes pressed through rollers

  
to create thin flakes and then steeped 
in water to draw out the proteins

  
Alternatively whole beans can be simply
soaked and ground

  
into a whitish protein rich liquid

  
In both cases the resulting substance 
can be used to make spongy foods

  
like tofu or filtered to produce soymilk

  
And at the industrial scale

  
these proteins can be used in various ways
to help make processed foods

  
Soy fats may be even more versatile

  
In one extraction method

  
soybeans are dried cleaned 
and then fed into an extruder

  
This machine simultaneously heats
and presses the beans

  
producing a liquid containing soy oil
and other fatty components

  
By adding water and spinning the mixture
components are separated into two parts

  
refined soy oil for things like salad
dressing and a substance called lecithin

  
Lecithin is made of molecules
called phospholipids

  
which have a phosphate head that attracts
water and a tail that attracts fats

  
These features make phospholipids
excellent for blending ingredients

  
that naturally separate from each other

  
This process is called emulsification

  
and soy lecithins are used 
as an emulsifying agent

  
in a huge variety of foods

  
For example during chocolate production

  
phospholipids attach to both the fatty
components of the cocoa butter

  
and the watersoluble sugar particles

  
making them easier to combine
into a smooth mixture

  
A similar process happens 
in powdered products

  
that need to be instantly rehydrated

  
Soy lecithin bonds with the water

  
and helps the powder 
disperse more quickly

  
While there are other plants 
we can process for lecithin and proteins

  
soy’s mild taste 
and widespread availability

  
have earned it a place 
in thousands of food products

  
But is it unhealthy to be eating
this much soy

  
Not really

  
Soybeans contain many of the essential
amino acids our bodies need

  
making them one of the best ways 
to get these proteins without eating meat

  
And the beans’ fat content is largely
made up of socalled “good” fats—

  
poly and monounsaturated fatty acids

  
which can decrease cholesterol 
and reduce the risk of heart disease

  
There are some compounds in soy

  
that may inhibit our body’s absorption
of various minerals

  
And about % of the general population
has a soy allergy

  
which can be severe in rare cases

  
But for many people the biggest complaint
about soy consumption

  
is the occasional increase in flatulence

  
Outside our bodies however
soy is much more worrying

  
To accommodate the soy farms needed
for heavy industry

  
processed foods and livestock feed 
huge swaths of land have been deforested

  
Between  and  roughly
 square kilometers of the Amazon

  
were cleared for soy production

  
In some regions this has also led
to the displacement of farmers

  
and indigenous communities

  
So if we want to keep using soy
and all its byproducts

  
we’ll need to find a way 
to do it humanely and sustainably

  
Pasture is the single
largest type of land

  
on the surface of the Earth today

  
thanks to our taste for meat and dairy

  
Just over a quarter of all land
is used for livestock

  
That's more than forests
or farm fields or anything else

  
Most of that land is best for ruminants

  
such as cows

  
that can digest highfiber feed
such as grass and straw

  
However the process by which grass
and fiber is broken up

  
in the stomachs of cows
and other grazing ruminants

  
has a byproduct methane

  
a potent greenhouse gas

  
Despite what you might have heard
about methane and cows

  
most of the methane
is actually burped out

  
not through the back end

  
(Laughter)

  
And that represents
about two billion tons

  
of carbon dioxide equivalent per year

  
or more than four percent of our annual
global greenhouse gas emissions

  
We have a methane problem from cows

  
So how can you reduce these methane burps

  
My colleagues and I
may have found a solution

  
Seaweed!

  
Let me explain

  
A couple of years ago

  
an article was published
by Rob Kinley and colleagues

  
that showed almost complete
elimination of methane

  
when seaweed was added
to chopped grass in the lab

  
Great

  
But as an agricultural researcher

  
I know lots of additives
work well in the lab

  
but not in real animals

  
But there was something
different about seaweed

  
and the way in which it reduced methane

  
So we thought we should
test this in live animals

  
In collaboration with Joan Salwen

  
an entrepreneur

  
and colleagues from
James Cook University and CSIRO

  
we decided to conduct a small experiment

  
to determine the amount of seaweed
we might need to use

  
This was the first ever
experiment in dairy cattle

  
and we had no idea how much to give them

  
So we started with about  grams per day

  
going up to  grams

  
Mind you this was mixed in
with  kilograms of their feed

  
One of the graduate students
I work with Breanna Roque

  
trapped their methane burps

  
(Laughter)

  
In that first experiment

  
the emissions were reduced
by up to  percent

  
(Applause)

  
And I thought at first

  
the equipment must have
malfunctioned but it was real

  
But we are left with more
questions than answers

  
Would the microbes
in the gut get used to it

  
and start producing methane over time

  
Would the seaweed be stable
over a long period of time in storage

  
Would the taste be affected
and the cows turn up their noses

  
Or would the seaweed affect
the cows's health or milk production

  
So we teamed up again
to conduct another trial

  
Over a fivemonth period

  
we saw the seaweed
that was harvested three years prior

  
reduce emissions by over  percent

  
(Applause)

  
Our colleagues in Australia

  
they saw up to  percent
reduction in a similar trial

  
That kind of reduction
is simply staggering

  
And in the graph

  
you see methane emissions
in three levels of intake

  
So the first line
is for cattle with no seaweed

  
The second line is for cows

  
that were supplemented
with about  to  grams of seaweed

  
And the last one is for cows

  
supplemented with
about  to  grams of seaweed

  
As you can see as you increase
the amount of seaweed

  
you see a reduction in methane emissions

  
We have also seen
an improvement in bulking up

  
of the beef cattle
with no adverse health effects

  
So it’s a win for the environment;

  
it's a win for the farmers and consumers

  
A panel of  people got to taste steak

  
made from steers offered
seaweed and control

  
And they did not detect any difference

  
We also did a nutritional
quality of the meat

  
and we found no difference between
animals that were offered seaweed

  
and the control

  
So how does it work

  
Some seaweeds contain ingredients

  
that directly inhibit microbes
in the cow’s gut from forming methane

  
without interfering with food digestion

  
The amount of methane produced

  
is dependent on how much
the animal is eating

  
and what's in the diet

  
And as such

  
previous efforts to reduce
methane emissions

  
focused on changing their diets

  
or improving forage quality

  
And we do have potential solutions
other than seaweed

  
to reduce methane emissions

  
We looked at additives to feed
such as NOPs

  
reduce emissions by about  percent

  
Even garlic and citrus extract

  
can reduce methane burps
by over  percent

  
without affecting
animal health and productivity

  
Now you may ask

  
Why not stop eating
beef and drinking milk

  
Audience member Yeah!

  
(Laughter)

  
EK That would be a good question

  
So adopting a plantbased diet
with supplements

  
may help shrink
a person's carbon footprint

  
in highincome countries like the US

  
But you know a lot of people
are not going to do that

  
And for the rest of the world

  
these foods are needed
to provide key nutrients

  
such as vitamin B and vitamin A

  
which are critical for brain function

  
for vision and immunity

  
These are found almost exclusively
in beef and milk

  
In this graph you see different countries

  
with their annual meat consumption
per capita on the bar graph

  
and then you see the dots
representing the stunting rate

  
in children below the age
of five years old

  
And countries that have lower
consumption of methane

  
are associated with higher
incidence of stunting

  
I know this firsthand

  
Growing up in Eritrea

  
I loved milk and meat
when you could get it

  
which wasn't often

  
Even as a kid I always wondered

  
how a cow eating just grass
produces nutritious milk I love to drink

  
And that wonder pushed me
into a career to understand

  
and improve livestock production

  
so that people in lowincome countries
do not suffer with stunting

  
and other nutrientdeficiency diseases

  
(Applause)

  
So what now

  
We know seaweed can work

  
But the cultivation of the specific
seaweed has been a barrier

  
It's not so easy to farm
asparagopsis taxiformis

  
But there are a number of efforts
going on at the moment

  
to scale up production

  
Blue Ocean Barns is growing
seaweed in Hawaii already

  
and they estimate that there will be
enough production to feed all cattle

  
in the US by 

  
All we need now
is for governments to step up

  
and facilitate the use
of these methanebusting feed additives

  
Cattle industries in some countries

  
have already committed
to climate neutrality by 

  
But if we can get these
feedadditive innovations

  
into cow stomachs earlier

  
we can cut methane burps significantly

  
Given that methane only lasts
in the atmosphere for a decade or so

  
we could even slow global warming
in the short term

  
Yes we have a methane problem from cows

  
but we may have seaweed
and other solutions

  
for these methane burps

  
helping us provide meat and dairy
while maintaining a safe climate

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
If you've gone to a tech conference

  
literally any tech conference
in the last five years

  
you would walk away with the impression
that the connected easytonavigate

  
clean and green smart city
is just around the corner

  
The reality and the hype is

  
that many companies are working
on products and solutions to get there

  
Take transportation for example

  
Allegedly in the city of the future

  
you will be able to seamlessly plan
your journey from public transportation

  
to shared autonomous taxis
and even electric scooters

  
If you own a car it will be electric

  
and there will be charging stations
strategically placed throughout the city

  
So all you do is type
your location into your GPS

  
and it will automatically
take you to your location

  
in the minimum amount of time

  
and any payment you need for charging

  
will be done automatically
in the background

  
Now you might say wait a minute

  
there are companies
that are doing this today

  
I can do this today

  
But it’s individual companies

  
and it's certainly not ubiquitous
across the city

  
But it doesn't just stop
with transportation

  
Let's take health

  
In the future there will be airquality
monitors at every street corner

  
and they will be connected
with your asthma inhaler

  
so that you know when it's safe to go out

  
Or there will be infrared cameras

  
that are measuring the temperature
of citizens anonymously

  
and that will be connected
with your thermometer

  
so that we can detect future outbreaks

  
And of course you will also have
your wearable device

  
that connected to your bathroom scale
and your smart refrigerator

  
so that nutritionists doctors
and other companies

  
can come up with new ways
to keep you you know

  
slim and and trim as I am

  
Then of course there's shopping

  
I mean when you shop today you know

  
you purchase from different retailers

  
and you receive multiple shipments
during the course of the day

  
Now if you had an app
where you could set your preferences

  
and those shipments can be consolidated

  
and maybe you receive
fewer shipments during the week

  
a little bit less convenient

  
but you get to reduce
your carbon footprint

  
So these are all great ideas
and solutions and products

  
that companies are working on

  
but they all share
an underlying requirement

  
that could make that smart city

  
more of a distant dream
than a reality just around the corner

  
And that is the need for greater sharing
of data across companies

  
individuals and cities

  
And if there's one thing
that we've learned

  
is that companies
don't like to share data

  
they don't even like to share
our own data with us

  
So let alone data
with competitors or partners

  
And therein lies the dilemma

  
because if we want to have a chance
at really combating climate change

  
we need to have our cities become
as smart and as connected

  
as quickly as possible
and as many cities as possible

  
So we need to overcome
this fear of data sharing

  
and move towards the smartcity future

  
But why is it that companies
fear sharing data

  
Well it’s what I call “FOMA”

  
Not FOMO

  
the fear of missing out
on a great party or either opportunity

  
but FOMA the fear of missing out
on competitive advantage

  
Data is a source of competitive advantage

  
So why would companies want to give it up

  
In our research over the last two years

  
we've been looking
at many different solutions

  
that would improve the citizen experience

  
and as well sustainability
solutions for cities

  
And what we found is that  percent
of those solutions

  
require much more data sharing

  
across companies individuals and cities

  
So the question really comes

  
how do we motivate companies
to share more of their data

  
We need to actually
overcome this fear quickly

  
if we want to make meaningful
progress on climate change

  
Well as we talked
to a number of companies

  
that were building platforms
and ecosystems in different verticals

  
like logistics transportation

  
smart buildings smart cities

  
we asked about what it would take
to drive greater data sharing

  
across these different solutions

  
And what we heard were the usual concerns

  
data sharing is costly it’s complicated

  
And companies were concerned
about unintended disclosures

  
that could risk their brand

  
However there was one exception

  
And this I think is promising

  
Companies were more willing
to share their data

  
if it could serve a broader common purpose
beyond commercial motivations

  
And in particular

  
they're more willing to share their data
beyond their own four walls

  
if that data sharing could help
fight climate change

  
Let's take for example
a few car companies

  
that actually are fierce competitors

  
and they got together

  
and started to share detailed mapping data

  
so they could develop better solutions
for routing trucks

  
so they spend less time idling

  
and also could route trucks in a city

  
based on prevailing
wind patterns to reduce smog

  
These are pretty cool solutions
that companies are working on

  
But the real question is

  
if this common purpose
of fighting climate change

  
can help leaders overcome
their data sharing FOMA

  
how do we get them to actually do it

  
Well in our work we found
that it takes three actions

  
to jumpstart a virtuous cycle
of data sharing and innovation

  
First companies need to look for new
unexpected sources of data

  
Second they need to develop new
sustainability solutions quickly

  
And third they need to act
together for change

  
Let's take finding new
unexpected partners for data

  
Well what I mean by that

  
is looking well beyond
the four walls of a company

  
for sources of data that can be combined
with a company's own

  
to analyze and develop
new sustainability solutions

  
But let me give a specific example

  
Let's take farming

  
Farming historically
has been more art than science

  
You've had farmers that make
decisions on when to plant

  
what fertilizer to apply
when to irrigate etc

  
based on their own personal experience
and knowledge of the farm

  
Do you remember "Star Trek"

  
and when Spock could scan
the surface of a planet

  
to know what the habitat was
using the sensors from the “Enterprise”

  
and they could tell whether the planet
could support human life

  
Well I know I'm dating myself
and I'm a bit of a geek

  
but that science fiction
is becoming a reality today

  
You have data from satellites

  
from drones from sensors on the field

  
from connected farming equipment
that is collecting data

  
All of that can be combined

  
so that farmers can make
better realtime decisions on

  
how to improve their overall crop yield

  
reduce the amount of fertilizer
and other chemicals they need

  
and also conserve
scarce resources like water

  
So they can improve their income

  
lower their costs

  
and now they can even start
generating new income sources

  
by planting carbonabsorbing crops
and getting paid for that

  
So really quite fascinating
what's happening in agriculture

  
Next comes innovating quickly
new sustainability solutions

  
What I'm talking about is not
your typical long product road map

  
but we need to have companies
hire data scientists

  
that can analyze all these
different data sources

  
and in new agile ways

  
bring new products and services to market

  
We need to use data and digital quickly
to fight climate change

  
Finally acting together

  
Now let me come back
to the smartcity example

  
If we had transportation
companies and utilities

  
and buildings share data with the city

  
then the city could make better decisions
on investing in renewable energy projects

  
That could mean that you lower
your energy bill

  
and also reduce your carbon footprint

  
Or that transportation data
can be used to decide

  
where charging stations are needed

  
so that we can accelerate the speed
of adoption of electric vehicles

  
And that means maybe you spend
less time in traffic

  
but also your air is cleaner

  
So to really make progress
on more sustainable energy

  
we need to have data sharing across
buildings transportation and utilities

  
All of this data sharing needs to come
together for a brighter future

  
Now 

  
You also have a critical role to play

  
Of course we individually need to be
in control of our own data

  
Imagine you have an app
that allows you to set preferences

  
so that data from your car
from your utilities

  
from your shopping patterns can be shared

  
and you can make decisions
about your own carbon footprint

  
in a very easy way

  
So you can run "what if" scenarios

  
What if I purchase an electric car

  
What if I take the train
from Boston to New York versus fly

  
Or what if I change my shopping pattern
so I shop more locally

  
How much will that impact
my overall carbon footprint

  
Would you be willing to share more data

  
to have more sustainable climate

  
and to make those
climatefriendly decisions

  
Well I for one I'm pretty
excited about this future

  
a future where greater data sharing

  
can really help us
jointly combat climate change

  
What we need is for company leaders
to move away from FOMA

  
and back to good oldfashioned FOMO

  
The future is bright
if all that data can be shared

  
and I don't think
we really want to miss out

  
Thank you

On October st   residents 
of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood

  
approached William Simpson
who’d just bought a plot in the area

  
and told him to leave

  
The Simpsons would be the second 
Black family

  
in the otherwise white neighborhood  
where they intended to build a home

  
When the Simpsons refused offers 
to buy them out

  
their neighbors tried blocking
their home’s construction

  
They finally moved into their house 
but the incident had a ripple effect

  
Just a few months 
after the mob harassed the Simpsons

  
the first racially restrictive covenant
was put into place in Minneapolis

  
Covenants are agreements in property deeds
that are intended to regulate

  
how the property is to be used

  
Beginning in the mids

  
people in the United States and elsewhere
began employing them in a new way

  
specifically 
to racially restrict properties

  
They wrote clauses into deeds that were 
meant to prevent  all future owners

  
from selling or leasing 
to certain racial and ethnic groups

  
especially Black people

  
Between  and 

  
these racial covenants spread
like wildfire throughout the US

  
making cities more segregated 
and the suburbs more restricted

  
In the county encompassing Minneapolis

  
racial covenants eventually appeared 
on the deeds to more than  homes

  
Not only was this legal

  
but the US Federal Housing Administration

  
promoted racial covenants 
in their underwriting manual

  
While constructing new homes

  
real estate developers began racially
restricting them from the outset

  
Developments were planned as dream
communities for American families—

  
but for white people only

  
In  one company began building
what became widely recognized

  
as the prototype of the postwar American
suburb Levittown New York

  
It was a community 
of more than  identical homes

  
They cost around $ each 
and were intended to be affordable

  
for returning World War II veterans

  
But according to Levittown’s 
racial covenants none of the houses

  
could “be used or occupied by any person 
other than members of the Caucasian race”

  
with one exception servants

  
Between  and 

  
the population of the American suburbs
nearly doubled

  
as white people flocked 
to more racially homogenous areas

  
in a phenomenon known as “white flight”

  
The suburbs spread

  
replacing native ecosystems with miles
of pavement and waterguzzling lawns

  
And their diffuse layout necessitated
car travel

  
American automobile production quadrupled
between  and 

  
cementing the nation's dependence on cars

  
Federal programs like the GI Bill
offered American veterans

  
favorable lending rates for buying homes

  
But it was difficult for people of color
to take advantage of such resources

  
Racial covenants restricted them
from certain neighborhoods

  
And at the same time government programs
labelled neighborhoods of color

  
bad investments and often refused
to insure mortgages in those areas

  
Therefore banks usually wouldn’t lend
money to people purchasing property

  
in neighborhoods of color—
a practice that became known as redlining

  
So instead of owning homes 
that increased in value over time

  
creating wealth that could be passed
to future generations

  
many people of color were forced
to spend their income on rent

  
And even when they were<i </iable 
to buy property

  
their home’s value was less likely
to increase

  
The suburbs boasted culdesacs 
and dead ends that minimized traffic

  
Meanwhile city planners often identified
redlined neighborhoods

  
as inexpensive areas 
for industrial development

  
So the massive freeway projects 
of the midth century

  
disproportionately cut 
through redlined neighborhoods

  
accompanied by heavy industry
and pollution

  
As a result many neighborhoods of color
experience higher rates

  
of drinking water contamination asthma
and other health issues

  
People targeted by racial covenants
increasingly challenged them in court

  
and in  they were finally banned
under the Fair Housing Act

  
But the damage had been done

  
Racial covenants concentrated wealth
and amenities in white neighborhoods

  
and depressed the conditions 
and home values in neighborhoods of color

  
As of  about % of white families 
in the US owned their homes

  
while about % of Black families did

  
That gap is greatest 
in Minnesota’s Twin Cities

  
Across the country
neighborhoods remain segregated

  
and % of all suburban counties
are predominantly white

  
Some landlords real estate agents
and lenders

  
still discriminate against people 
based on race—

  
rejecting them steering them to and away 
from certain neighborhoods

  
or providing inaccessibly
high interest rates

  
Gentrification and exclusionary 
zoning practices also still displace

  
and keep people of color
out of certain neighborhoods

  
Racial covenants are now illegal

  
But they can still be seen
on many housing deeds

  
The legacy of racial covenants is etched
across the pristine lawns

  
of the American suburbs

  
It’s a footnote in the demographic divides
of every city

  
And it’s one of the insidious architects
of the hidden inequalities

  
that shape our world

  
My very first food memory
was when I was three or four

  
It was a warm day

  
and my mom had just picked me
and my sister up from school

  
buckled us into the back
of her dusty blue Ford Taurus

  
She was halfway out
of the school parking lot

  
when she pulled over to the side

  
She strangely reached for her purse
that was resting on the dashboard

  
started fishing around for something
until she found it

  
Then she twisted around to us

  
and she tore open a yellow paper bag

  
of slightly melted Sugar Babies

  
(Audience murmurs)

  
She poured a few of the pellets
into each of our tiny hands

  
Now I want to be clear

  
this was not a normal mom thing

  
This was breaking several rules

  
It was after lunch but before dinner

  
we were in the car

  
(Laughs)

  
we hadn't done anything spectacular
to be celebrated

  
And Sugar Babies are well pure sugar

  
I was so confused

  
But I was a kid so I took the candy
and I started chewing

  
God I felt like I had just been inducted
into the coolest club possible

  
The one that eats candy
on a random Wednesday

  
(Laughs)

  
And then the world it slowed down

  
Everything faded

  
And then everything sharpened

  
There is only one word
for what I felt in that moment

  
Magic

  
Real magic

  
Now most people think
that’s kind of crazy

  
three or four years old

  
I don't remember anything
about my childhood for years after that

  
but I remember that day

  
I remember those Sugar Babies

  
and I remember that feeling

  
Now most people think of magic
as a trick right

  
Abracadabra

  
This seemingly impossible act
put on purely for entertainment

  
But I'd like to challenge that

  
Magic real magic is not an illusion

  
Real magic is the feeling

  
when life transforms
from the ordinary into the extraordinary

  
And not only is it real

  
It is the very thing
that connects us to this world

  
to one another

  
to our entire existence

  
It's the spark of a moment

  
It's the feeling of believing

  
of belonging

  
of getting

  
of being gotten

  
It is the crack

  
that opens up our hearts
and reminds us to let light in

  
Now I own Milk Bar

  
this quirky Americanstyle bakery

  
that I'll tell you
a little bit about later

  
And I have found

  
that magic is often created
by breaking some sort of rule

  
Like the "no sweets before dinner" rule

  
Or wearing overalls
to a corporate board meeting

  
Or simply daring to defy the expectations
of the people around us

  
Now as a kid

  
breaking the rules usually
only got us in trouble right

  
But as adults it's a different story

  
Breaking the rules pushing boundaries

  
challenging the norm

  
asking why why not

  
It does something to us

  
It shakes us from sleepwalking

  
And it makes space for magic to sneak in

  
Now I was raised by matriarchs

  
fierce heroic grandmas
who loved to bake in their free time

  
And they knew good and well that food
was for nutrition and sustenance

  
but they didn't care

  
(Laughs)

  
They'd baked as their way
of breaking the rules

  
They'd make batches of lemon bars
instead of casseroles

  
or onepot wonders

  
And they put those baked goods in baggies

  
and hand them out

  
hand that magic out
to the most unassuming people

  
The newcomer to the neighborhood

  
the mail carrier or my personal favorite

  
the receptionist at the dentist office

  
(Laughs)

  
Now I knew what the receiving end
of magic felt like

  
from that Sugar Baby moment

  
But witnessing what the giving part
of real magic did 

  
It moved these people

  
It was aweinspiring

  
And so I decided

  
that baking would be my way
of making magic in the world

  
creating a moment and then giving it away

  
A magic pyramid scheme basically

  
that I wanted needed more of

  
Only my mom and my grandmas
thought that baking was just a hobby

  
But I knew it could be more than that

  
So I moved to New York City
to become a professional pastry chef

  
I went to culinary school;

  
I climbed the ladder of fancy restaurants

  
making fancy desserts
to become the very best of the best

  
Only 

  
I never found magic in those beautiful
delicate plated desserts

  
I could only find my magic
in a cookie or a slice of cake

  
or a gooey underbaked pie

  
And so when I opened Milk Bar

  
that bakery that I was telling you about

  
I decided I wasn't going to frost
the sides of a cake

  
like the textbooks taught me

  
(Laughter)

  
I decided I was going to load
cookie dough with marshmallows

  
or pretzels and potato chips

  
and butterscotch chips and coffee

  
tossing convention out the window

  
I wanted people to eat birthday cake
not just on their birthday

  
but any day they wanted

  
I knew that my magic came in the form
of these simple baked goods

  
but I also knew that simple
approachable accessible

  
nostalgic flavors

  
were my best jumpingoff place
to create new desserts

  
Almost as though fancy
were the enemy of delicious

  
I’d go to county fairs to nosh

  
I'd go to the diner
and order slices of pie

  
from that revolving display case

  
I'd take french fries and dip them
in chocolate milkshake and dream

  
And then I'd go into the kitchen
and tie on my apron

  
and start mixing up a new creation

  
rooted in something known
and safe and loved

  
but reaching far beyond
what anyone thought accessible

  
Or approachable

  
Or doable

  
Breaking the banking rules
became my daily ritual

  
I mean who says a layer cake can't taste
like salty malty sweet pretzels

  
I mean my culinary instructors for one

  
(Laughs)

  
"Watch me" I'd think

  
And I'd take pretzels

  
toast them in the oven
to deepen their flavor

  
then grind them
into a powderlike consistency

  
and substitute some
of the cake flour in a recipe

  
for that pretzel powder

  
It's pretty good

  
When I was opening Milk Bar
I knew I wanted to serve ice cream

  
A rebellious kind of ice cream

  
No surprise right

  
So I decided to buy a soft serve machine

  
which for the record
was very rebellious at the time

  
I had to decide what flavor to make

  
I mean why do we only accept
chocolate and vanilla

  
as ice cream flavors

  
I needed to come up
with something better different

  
Push that boundary

  
I knew I had to come up
with a flavor of milk

  
that was different

  
Milk is like the base
of any great ice cream

  
So I sat out inspiration
at my hour bodega

  
Favorite place to go

  
Because that's where we all shop

  
that's where our simple
taste buds are formed

  
it's the flavors we know

  
Up and down the aisles till I hit it

  
My favorite section
of the grocery store as a kid

  
the cereal aisle

  
Now as a kid my mom and I
had an agreement

  
I was a pretty picky eater

  
and we agreed that I could have
as much cereal as I wanted

  
as long as I drank
all the calciumrich milk

  
at the bottom of the bowl

  
I mean I thought it was highway robbery

  
Does she not understand how good
that sugary sweet milk was at the bottom

  
That's interesting

  
That's a really delicious flavor of milk

  
It moved me

  
It made sense to me

  
but would it make sense to other people

  
Figured I'd give it a try

  
So I went back to the kitchen

  
and made the equivalent
of a giant bowl of cereal

  
I strained out all that delicious milk

  
and I spun it into ice cream

  
Put it on the menu

  
And I've got to tell you even now

  
people stop me on the street

  
to tell me about their cerealmilk
ice cream moment

  
"So good"

  
"Seemingly a little naughty"

  
I mean how did I know
that was their flavor

  
That's the flavor they eat
when they're wearing pajamas

  
when no one's looking

  
The flavor of their childhood

  
These people will tell me
about every detail of the day

  
They will tell me about the weather
the company they kept

  
the way that an ordinary moment
was transformed into something magical

  
with a simple bite

  
I built my business with the same
"challenge the norm" mentality

  
Rather than measure my business's success
by the profit or loss sheet

  
by the average order value

  
the other metrics that businesses use

  
to know if they're doing well

  
I decided we'd measure our impact
by the twinkle in people's eyes

  
By the "Oh I can't put that down" feeling

  
that they had when they ate
one of our desserts

  
I chose to put women
at the helm of my organization

  
Because when I looked
around the hospitality industry

  
people running operations
folks holding CEO titles

  
they were all men

  
I mean why

  
I was raised by these fierce matriarchs
who handled business

  
and I wanted my organization
to look like that

  
I want to show the world
what women were capable of

  
and what a "bakery" could be

  
Push back on that cute little box
people like to put us in

  
And in turn the rules broke for us

  
The magic our magic got out

  
Word spread without us spending
a dollar on marketing

  
Rare in our industry

  
we grew our business
without diluting the business

  
I mean we won awards

  
no tiny East Village bakery
has any business winning

  
(Laughs)

  
It's pretty incredible

  
Even today

  
I get to witness that feeling

  
that same one that my grandmas
conjured up in my childhood

  
We ship cakes all across the country

  
we keep our doors open from early
in the morning until late at night

  
It's insane for a bakery to do

  
But we do it because we're
obsessed with it

  
We're obsessed with what we do

  
We teach classes we share recipes

  
despite any concerns of copycats

  
or intellectual property infringements

  
because that's what you do

  
when you benefit
from what came before you

  
and you plan on passing it
along long after you

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
When you know you're here
to give not take

  
and leave this place
better than you found it

  
See mom you can bake for a living

  
Pretty cool if you ask me

  
Now I don't have
the full equation cracked

  
but I do know that it starts
with the decision to act

  
My mom she could have driven
that car home routinely

  
but she decided that that day
would not be like the others

  
She threw out that rule book
for just a second

  
I carry this lesson with me

  
that every day has within it hundreds

  
thousands of opportunities
to create real magic

  
Only they disappear

  
Unless you reach out and grab them

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
A few years ago I sailed on a ship
that comes from an earlier era

  
when moving goods by sea
didn't mean polluting the planet

  
Our voyage to the Caribbean
was eyeopening

  
and not just because I learned
that apparently I’m incurably seasick

  
(Laughter)

  
I also saw what it's like

  
when you take away the diesel fumes
and the black smoke

  
that spew from today's
freighters and ports

  
Instead our vessel smelled
like fresh sea breeze

  
and the bags of cardamom we carried

  
and all that camomile tea I was chugging

  
Nearly every modern cargo ship
relies on highly polluting fossil fuels

  
Fortunately there's a way
to clean up the industry

  
beyond just reviving
oldfashioned sailing ships

  
and it's 

  
green ammonia

  
If you know anything about ammonia

  
it's probably that it's stinky
it's toxic it's potentially explosive

  
So it's a great place to start right

  
Ammonia is mainly used today
to make chemicals and fertilizers

  
But for many reasons
industry experts are convinced

  
that ammonia could be a gamechanging way
to drive giant cargo ships

  
and that it could be used safely
and be costcompetitive

  
Tens of thousands of freighters
crisscross the oceans every day

  
bringing the food we eat
the clothes we wear the cars we drive

  
Container ships alone

  
carry some four trillion dollars
worth of goods by sea every year

  
That's roughly the GDP of Germany

  
At the same time

  
the shipping industry
contributes a significant share

  
of the world's annual
greenhouse gas emissions

  
If shipping were a country

  
it'd be the sixth largest emitter of CO

  
trailing just behind Japan

  
And as world economies grow
and populations rise

  
shipping's emissions are expected to soar

  
unless the industry
charts a cleaner course

  
Green ammonia really first came
to my attention in 

  
at the UN Climate Change Conference
in Bonn Germany

  
At the panel I attended
ammonia seemed kind of like an aside

  
or something we should be keeping tabs on

  
Since then the industry
has really coalesced around ammonia

  
as the next dominant shipping fuel

  
Chemical companies and investors

  
are spending millions of dollars
to build green ammonia plants

  
and shipbuilders and manufacturers

  
are busy developing
the necessary technology

  
The first ammoniapowered ships
are just around the corner

  
So what's so special
about this pungent gas

  
Well to start ammonia doesn't contain
any carbon molecules

  
so it doesn't create carbon dioxide
when used as fuel

  
Instead it contains one part nitrogen 

  
which is the main component of air 

  
and three parts hydrogen
which is a building block of water

  
It's possible to make ammonia
without using any fossil fuels

  
That's what makes it "green" ammonia

  
Think of it like this

  
instead of the oil wells
and petroleum refineries

  
that make today's dirty diesel fuels

  
picture solar panels or wind turbines
or hydropower plants

  
Renewable electricity is the foundation
of this whole ammoniamaking ordeal

  
We can start with electrolysis

  
which uses electricity to split water
into hydrogen and oxygen

  
Then renewables can power the process
that separates nitrogen from air

  
And so with our hydrogen and nitrogen
we can combine the two

  
in an industrial process
at high temperatures

  
to make NH  ammonia

  
Now if you want to use
this ammonia to power

  
your thousandfootlong freighter

  
you have two options

  
The first is an internal
combustion engine

  
so similar to how diesel
is used in ships today

  
but with certain modifications

  
Experts think that the first vessels
to use ammonia in their engines

  
will be chemical tankers

  
because they already carry it
in their cargo holds

  
So they'll be like the early adopters

  
The next options is to use a fuel cell

  
Fuel cells create electricity
through a chemical reaction

  
and that's what drives the ship's motors
and turns the propellers

  
In Norway work is underway

  
to launch the world's first
ammoniafuelcell ship

  
in just a few years' time

  
So we can make green ammonia

  
and we can use it
in fuel cells or engines

  
The final piece of the ammonia
puzzle is the infrastructure

  
the storage facilities the pipelines
the distribution networks 

  
everything that's needed to ensure
a ship can fill its tanks

  
anywhere in the world

  
And none of this is particularly novel

  
because we already have infrastructure

  
for the chemical
and fertilizer industries

  
Now it just needs to be built near ports

  
and at a global scale 

  
and with great caution

  
So what's needed
to take ammonia mainstream

  
We can draw a rough parallel
to the rise of electric cars

  
A decade ago

  
about  EVs
were on the roads worldwide

  
Then more and more countries
adopted policies

  
encouraging people to buy EVs

  
supporting manufacturers

  
and to build up charging infrastructure

  
And as sales climbed
and production boomed

  
the cost of batteries
and other components plummeted

  
making it easier for more people
to afford electric cars

  
So now instead of  EVs
it's more like  million

  
and green ammonia
could follow a similar path

  
in the shipping industry

  
Policies to curb emissions
and incentivize green investments

  
could spur a shift away from fossil fuels

  
And as ammonia catches on

  
fuel prices and technology costs
could decline in step

  
enabling more ship operators
to make the switch

  
And while all of that is happening

  
a much bigger story will be playing out
on the global scale

  
the rising development and plunging costs
of renewable energy supplies

  
Giant offshore wind farms

  
sprawling solar arrays
and other technologies

  
could provide the electrons
needed to make that green ammonia

  
Green ammonia might be
the main fuel source

  
on future cargo ships

  
but it doesn’t have to be
the only clean technology onboard

  
Ships will likely use
a combination of tools

  
Batteries can already power
the lights and equipment on giant ships

  
and certainly smaller vessels
can be fully batterypowered today

  
Design fixes like supersleek hulls
and dolphinlike flippers

  
can improve ships' efficiency

  
And another technology
that's quickly gaining traction

  
is called "windassisted propulsion"

  
which puts a modern twist
on an old idea of harnessing wind

  
One cargo ship I sailed on
in the North Sea

  
uses devices called "rotor sails"

  
These are foottall tubes

  
that spin around
like hyperactive barber's poles

  
which produces a forward thrust

  
and reduces demand on the diesel engines

  
It's really exciting to see
these things whip around

  
but it's funny how almost blasé
the crew was about the whole thing

  
They push a button

  
the tubes swirl to life
the ships saves fuel

  
and they can all carry on
with their normal tasks

  
as we sailed from Rotterdam

  
to this industrial eyesore
in northern England

  
and back again

  
Meanwhile of course

  
I spent my time admiring the sails

  
and then curling up in the fetal position
as the sea knocked our ship around

  
The maritime industry
is at a pivotal moment

  
in its long and storied history

  
Over the last few centuries

  
fossil fuels have powered the freighters
that have transformed global trade

  
connecting cotton fields
to farflung garment factories

  
and bringing blueberries
from one side of the equator to the other

  
Coalpowered steamships made it possible
to travel farther and faster

  
and diesel engines
took this into overdrive

  
What began in the early th century
as a humble canal boat

  
puttering along with this tiny engine

  
has since become giant container ships

  
that stretch as long
as skyscrapers stand tall

  
We know that to keep the planet
from warming further

  
we must completely transform the way
that we power our homes our cars

  
and the freighters that bring us
all our precious stuff

  
The shipping industry
must join the rest of the world

  
in addressing climate change

  
and it could do that
with the help of green ammonia

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause)

  
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and wow you’re still reeling

  
You’re a particle of matter 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces

  
fusion and annihilation

  
If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter

  
you'll be the seed of a future galaxy

  
You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game

  
A friendly gluon explains

  
there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles

  
At the blow of a cosmic whistle

  
every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right

  
will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate

  
The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle

  
and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains

  
They’d been waiting for someone like you
as with a perfectly balanced setup

  
no one would be left in the end

  
As guest of honor they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring

  
What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing

  
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like

  
But we can rely on how it should end 
with you as the last particle standing

  
Let's start there and work backwards

  
Just before this there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs

  
Here’s  for the sake of example

  
This right away suggests a strategy

  
You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle

  
by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles

  
then the newly adjacent pairs and so on
to reach this final set

  
If you map them back 
to the original circle

  
standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles

  
or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles

  
means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive

  
So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles

  
You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance

  
of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy

  
You’re soon left alone

  
But wait a minute!

  
Today’s the big day

  
You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races

  
Every hundred million years

  
sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core

  
to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from

  
Each of the  attendees

  
has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter

  
Except you you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor

  
and reenact its moment of choice

  
Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring

  
Your job pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated

  
The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before

  
but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes

  
The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle

  
count cubes of each type
perform arithmetic

  
and carry out simple logical commands

  
How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots

  
Pause to figure it out for yourself
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Let’s go back to our earlier approach

  
running time backwards 
starting from you alone

  
then a sequence of pairs of cubes

  
A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes

  
As does the next and the next
each adding nestled pairs

  
like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles

  
A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate

  
Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right

  
buffering you from antimatter

  
We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum starting with your +

  
For instance this would be +++

  
From your perspective 
no matter how far you look

  
this sum will be positive

  
Considering how we introduced pairs 
this makes sense—

  
each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus

  
If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube

  
its sum will eventually hit zero

  
The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner

  
Again our introduction of pairs 
reflects this;

  
nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes

  
We can now program the device

  
Start a running sum with +
representing you

  
and scan around the circle

  
For each matter cube add one

  
and for each antimatter cube 
subtract one

  
If all  cubes have been scanned

  
without the sum ever hitting 

  
that spot is safe

  
Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks

  
Hello everyone

  
My name is Orit yes

  
And I study insurance

  
Telling people that you study insurance
is not a good way to start a conversation

  
In fact if ever you need
to end the conversation

  
try it tell people you study insurance

  
People don't want to talk about insurance

  
They don't think it's all that exciting

  
But I disagree

  
I find insurance fascinating;
in fact I find it magical

  
And today I'd like to show you why

  
Now the famous author Franz Kafka

  
used to work for an insurance
company in Prague

  
And this is what Kafka
had to say about insurance

  
He said "Insurance is like a religion

  
Insurance is like a primitive religion

  
It's the religion of people
who believe that by having insurance

  
they can ward off evil"

  
So according to Kafka

  
what leads us to buy insurance
is not rational thinking

  
but magical thinking

  
It's the belief that if I have insurance

  
somehow magically those negative events
that I fear in the future

  
they're not going to happen

  
Of course this is totally irrational

  
It's like believing
that if you have an umbrella

  
it's not going to rain

  
If your car gets stolen yes

  
the insurance company
will cushion the blow

  
With the compensation money

  
you could probably afford a new car

  
But the fact that you have insurance

  
does not make your car
less likely to be stolen

  
The risk is the same
whether you are insured or not

  
So are people this naive

  
Do they really believe
that if they have insurance

  
they are less at risk

  
Yes

  
Perhaps not consciously but they do

  
Let me show you

  
In one of my studies

  
I asked people to predict
what is the likelihood

  
that in the future they will suffer
all kinds of medical misfortunes

  
yhat they will need an operation
physiotherapy or nursing care

  
Another group was asked
to make the same predictions

  
but we first asked them

  
"Do you have health insurance"

  
And of course they do

  
Israel has universal coverage

  
Reminding people
that they have health insurance

  
had a fascinating effect

  
It made them feel less at risk

  
Surprisingly the effect
was not limited to medical problems

  
It also made them believe
that they are less likely to lose money

  
and my personal favorite

  
asking people in Tel Aviv
if they have health insurance

  
made the prospect of a war
in Europe seem less likely

  
(Laughter)

  
And that's magic

  
Kafka was right

  
There is an interesting paradox here

  
We buy insurance against those events
that we fear the most

  
But once we are armed
with this protection measure

  
we feel that we are no longer
at risk somehow magically

  
And this protection effect
is not unique to insurance policies

  
We see it with other
protection measures as well

  
Let me show you

  
In  the citizens of Israel

  
were very worried about a possible
military attack by Iran

  
And the government was distributing
gas masks to all the citizens

  
At the time we called people
and asked them to predict

  
what are the chances
that Iran would attack Israel

  
with weapons of mass destruction

  
The ratings were quite high

  
People were worried

  
But if we first asked them
"Do you have a gas mask"

  
then the ratings dropped dramatically

  
And that's magic

  
Apart from the fact
that gas masks are largely useless

  
against weapons of mass destruction

  
the fact that you have a gas mask
is unlikely to affect the strategic

  
or the tactical decision
of a foreign power

  
We have to remember

  
insurance is an antidote
it's not a vaccine

  
It doesn’t ward off evil;

  
it doesn't eliminate
the risks that we face

  
However when it comes to insurance

  
the distinction between
an antidote and a vaccine

  
somehow gets blurred in our minds

  
Why does it happen

  
It happens because people
are not that good

  
at assessing risks rationally

  
Let me give you an example

  
When I arranged my flight to come here

  
I had to decide if I wanted
to buy travel insurance

  
Rationally I should have based
this decision on several considerations

  
the price of the policy of course

  
the value of my luggage

  
the aggravation
that I'm likely to experience

  
if my luggage gets lost

  
And of course the likelihood
of such an event right

  
But most of the time we're just too busy
to make such rational calculations

  
And anyway

  
I doubt that Lufthansa are very keen
to share their damage statistics with me

  
So what do we do instead

  
We rely on our intuition

  
So how do we evaluate risks intuitively

  
We start by imagining
the outcomes that we fear

  
So here I am

  
it's late at night
I'm sitting at this airport

  
all the other passengers
already collected their luggage and left

  
I realize that my own suitcase
is now probably heading to the North Pole

  
Thinking about this scenario
creates anxiety

  
and then we use the level
of anxiety that we feel

  
in order to assess the probability

  
So if I'm feeling terrified

  
I will infer that the risk
of such an event is quite high

  
But you see this is
an intuitive risk estimate

  
It is entirely psychological
and emotionbased

  
which is why it is also highly susceptible
to the magic of insurance

  
Insurance reduces our anxiety

  
First because the outcomes
that we imagine are suddenly less grim

  
Yes I'm sitting at the airport
yes it's late at night

  
all the other passengers had left

  
but there will be this guy there
they would give me a voucher

  
eventually I will get
compensated it's OK

  
Also because we are conditioned
to associate insurance with safety

  
security tranquility and peace of mind

  
And if I'm feeling less anxious

  
I would infer that the risk
is not that high

  
So there you have it

  
I have insurance and the risk is gone

  
But why do we associate insurance
with peace of mind

  
Well first in many languages

  
this is exactly what the word
"insurance" means

  
It comes from the word "sure"
which means lack of doubts

  
no unknowns that would sneak up
and bite you in the future right

  
But also because traditionally

  
this is how insurance was promoted

  
Let me show you an example

  
This is a lovely advertising toy

  
that was distributed to visitors
at the British exhibition in 

  
So you see this guy
and he looks terrified

  
He is barraged by the bricks of doom

  
fire accident falling on his head

  
And the tag on the bottom

  
it reads "anxiety" which perfectly
describes the guy's expression

  
But if you pull on that tag

  
something slides inside
and the guy transforms

  
First he now has the protection
of the Prudential insurance helmet

  
and his expression
is changed into a smile

  
You know why

  
Because Prudential insurance
dispels anxiety

  
Modern images of insurance
convey the same message

  
Insurance logos often incorporate
supporting hand below

  
and umbrellas above ultimate protection

  
And then travel insurance ads

  
They could easily be mistaken
for vacation brochures right

  
Romantic couples
exotic islands palm trees

  
And if for some reason
you need images of smiling

  
happy people wearing white

  
do an image Google search
with the words "pension plans"

  
or "health insurance"

  
Insurance ads rarely show you
sick people smashed cars torn suitcase

  
The message is loud and clear

  
You have insurance

  
all is well in the world

  
However to get us to buy insurance

  
the promoters must also work our fears

  
Which is why right after
you paid a lot of money

  
for a top of the line refrigerator

  
the same seller who just moments ago

  
were explaining
how reliable this product is

  
is now telling you that it may
break down at any moment

  
which is why you should buy
the extended warranty

  
And with some credit cards
you could get free travel insurance

  
All you need to do is to call the agent

  
But when you make this call

  
you are told yeah but the free deal
is only for the basic plan

  
Basic plan doesn't sound
good already right

  
And then you get to hear a list of things
that you are not covered against

  
like fires and heart transplant
and floods etc

  
But if you pay one more
dollar a day right

  
And your active imagination does the rest

  
with each item on the list
your anxiety is mounting

  
and you don't ask yourself
"Hey I'm going to Paris

  
why would I care about a tsunami"

  
You pay the dollar and all is well
in the world again

  
In fact

  
just realizing that we are not
covered against something

  
is enough to distort
our perception of risk

  
I once asked people to imagine
in one of my studies

  
that they're going to go on a trip

  
and they plan to buy
travel insurance at the airport

  
But by the time they reach the counter

  
boarding had already started

  
and they have to board that airplane
painfully aware that they are not covered

  
And then I asked them to assess
all kinds of travelrelated risks

  
And these were dramatically inflated

  
compared to the ratings of people
who did have insurance

  
For example lost luggage

  
the risk of lost luggage
almost  percent

  
What are the chances
that you will need hospitalization

  
Almost  percent well  percent

  
And how about
you will need to be rescued

  
Thirtyone percent

  
I remember the first time
I saw this data I was speechless

  
I was thinking

  
"Guys if this is what you believe
why would you ever leave home"

  
you know

  
(Laughter)

  
Yeah

  
Boarding an airplane
with no insurance is tempting fate

  
It's like realizing that your insurance
policy had just expired

  
and not renewing it

  
Grave danger indeed

  
Your appliances they know you know

  
So we buy insurance
and restore our peace of mind

  
And now you're probably asking yourself

  
"But peace of mind is good

  
What's wrong with peace of mind" right

  
"What's the problem"

  
The problem is that we are highly
likely to be overinsured

  
What does it mean

  
Well first

  
we may be protecting ourselves
against really unlikely events

  
like a tsunami in Paris

  
Or we may be paying a lot
to prevent a trivial loss

  
Does it really make sense to extend
the warranty on an old washing machine

  
And if you will examine
your own policies back at home

  
many of you will find
that you have redundant coverage

  
You are paying several policies
on the same event

  
Many of you do that

  
Me included and I should know better

  
So 

  
This kind of behavior
can get people in debt

  
and even if they don't

  
this is money that we could spend
in far more pleasurable ways right

  
At least I can

  
But selling peace of mind is a problem
for the insurance companies as well

  
Why

  
The insurance companies are well aware
of the problem called “moral hazard”

  
You see when people are insured

  
they become negligent

  
They start leaving
their valuables out in the open

  
They don't check their fire alarms
they drive faster

  
In short they act in ways
which put them at greater risk

  
Now the insurance companies

  
they believe that we behave like that

  
because we know that if something happens

  
someone else will pay

  
Which is why many policies
include deductibles

  
That's the money that comes
out of your pocket right

  
So the deductibles are there to make sure

  
that some of the risk
will stay with the client

  
But based on the research
that I just shared with you

  
it is entirely possible

  
that the reason that we are careless

  
is not just that we think
that someone else will pay

  
but it's also the magical belief
that if I have insurance

  
it's not going to rain

  
The damage is not going to happen

  
and magical thinking
is not susceptible to deductibles

  
What are the lessons to be learned

  
For us for you

  
Next time you consider buying insurance

  
remember Kafka

  
Ask yourself

  
Am I buying insurance
for the right reasons

  
Am I making a sound economic decision

  
or merely trying to please my psyche

  
As for the insurance companies

  
I hope they will consider
changing their message

  
Don't sell magical happiness

  
Encourage us to buy insurance
when it is economically rational

  
and the responsible thing to do

  
And finally

  
guys I hope that next time
someone says "I study insurance"

  
you would say "Wonderful

  
Please tell me more"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Now when you think of the industries
most responsible for climate change

  
you probably summon up
an image of an oil rig right

  
Maybe even a coal mine

  
or a megafarm

  
perhaps heavy engineering

  
But there’s one industry
that’s never mentioned in that list

  
even though every other industry
depends upon it

  
I’m talking about
an economic sector that makes 

  
nothing

  
It has no stock

  
no warehouses

  
no factories

  
It’s entirely powered by brains

  
by spreadsheets

  
and by PowerPoint

  
Who is this mystery industry

  
The professional services
of advertising and PR firms

  
the big management consultancies

  
the corporate lawyers and lobbyists

  
Together this sector is worth
over two trillion dollars a year

  
Let’s call it the “X industry”

  
where X is for influence

  
Now when it comes to climate change

  
each individual firm in this sector
has the carbon footprint

  
probably no bigger
than your average kindergarten

  
But the brainprint of the X industry
is felt everywhere

  
And that’s because these problemsolvers
and storytellers act

  
as the grease in the wheel
of all other businesses on Earth

  
And that gives the X industry
an outsize influence

  
on the likelihood that we reach netzero

  
or they will be one of the primary
architects of climate destruction

  
Now how

  
Remember that oil rig
we imagined a moment ago

  
Think about how it’s actually built

  
I’ve seen this firsthand

  
It takes a village of X industry
advisers to raise a rig

  
First 

  
often

  
the oil exploration proposals
are financially modeled

  
by one of the big constultancies

  
Then the lobbying firms
push through regulatory approval

  
often years if not decades ahead
of a single drop of oil being pumped

  
Then the PR agencies

  
they come in and they work
to get local communities onside

  
And the legal firms
squash any legal objection

  
Finally the creative agencies
craft influence campaigns

  
to help sell the image of the oil industry

  
and to sell the product itself

  
Oil companies know how to drill for oil

  
but they’ve outsourced
almost everything else

  
to this army of publicists
and consultants

  
to lawyers and to lobbyists

  
We all remember the Deepwater
Horizon disaster of 

  
when BP polluted the Gulf of Mexico

  
with over four million barrels of oil

  
What you might not know

  
is that BP admitted

  
to spending three times as much
on promotional advertising

  
in the year after the disaster
than in the year before

  
And arguably

  
the X industry has done
a better job of cleaning up BP’s image

  
than BP has yet done cleaning up
the Gulf of Mexico

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Oh come on come on

  
Is it really fair for me to hold
the X industry responsible

  
for the environmental impact
of their clients

  
There is no official way
to do so just yet

  
We recognize only three scopes
of carbon emission

  
Scopes one and two

  
all the direct emissions
from your fleets and your factories

  
and the power that you purchase

  
In the UK

  
the advertising association has estimated

  
that the entire carbon footprint
of the UK ad industry

  
worth over  billion dollars a year

  
is just  million tonnes

  
 million tonnes

  
Now scope three

  
the third scope

  
this is a bit harder

  
This is all the indirect emissions
from how people use your products

  
or from your supply chain

  
And that’s a necessary headache
for a lot of companies

  
to start taking control over

  
But technically the X industry
barely moves the dial here either

  
That’s why I believe that the X industry
needs a new scope X

  
a way to account
for the emissions of influence

  
Now the 

  
(Applause)

  
The experts at the Purpose
Disruptors network have made a start

  
at doing just that

  
They looked at a single
advertising campaign made for Audi

  
Now this campaign won one of the big
effectiveness awards in advertising

  
And the car company
and their advertising agency claimed

  
that this single campaign
generated  billion dollars

  
of incremental revenue for Audi

  
The ad campaign sold a lot of cars

  
And if their claim is correct

  
it also generated  million tonnes
of additional carbon for Audi

  
So this is a onetofive ratio

  
between the impact
of an entire industry 

  
the entire ad industry 

  
versus one single advertising campaign

  
It is time for those of us like me

  
who work in this industry

  
to take our responsibility seriously

  
And that starts with being honest
about who pays our bills

  
The X industry is famously
murky about that

  
And so my firm in  produced
the first client disclosure report

  
It’s very simple

  
We just disclosed our revenue
by the client industries which we serve

  
I’m so pleased to say
that  other ad agencies

  
consultancies and PR companies

  
have now promised to do the same

  
(Applause)

  
But our industry is dominated
by a handful of really big consultancies

  
and advertising agencies

  
and not one of them
have yet promised to join us

  
And this really matters

  
because the X industry is hiring up
many of the most inventive

  
creative

  
knowledgeable

  
and influential minds that humanity has

  
And those are the exact
same skills that we need

  
to change the course of climate change

  
Now we need all of that X industry talent
to stop serving destruction

  
and start serving solutions

  
And if you work in the X industry

  
you’re probably beginning to feel
a little bit uncomfortable right now

  
Good

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I want you to ask yourself

  
Are you selling your talent
to the right people

  
Are you serving the causes
of climate change or the solutions to it

  
And are you using all that vaunted ability
to influence your clients

  
or just to influence their critics

  
This must be the solutions decade

  
and we’re nearly two years into our window

  
to change our systems
towards climate justice

  
towards clean energy

  
circular systems

  
sustainable and equitable lifestyles

  
This solutions decade desperately requires
really goodquality financial modeling

  
It requires a really strong
legal framework

  
great research

  
It really needs public support

  
It needs the right regulatory rules

  
And it needs creative storytelling

  
and that’s what my X industry
could deliver

  
This year I changed my job title
to “Chief Solutionist”

  
I changed it to constantly remind myself
of the job that needs doing

  
Because as an X industry leader myself

  
I can either serve
the solutions every day

  
or by default

  
I’m serving destruction

  
There is no middle ground here

  
There must be no
carefully worded rationales

  
And the X industry can no longer pretend
it can remain neutral

  
Now if we do that

  
perhaps we could become
a league of solutionists

  
and shift all of this creativity

  
inventiveness

  
knowledge and influence

  
towards fixing climate change

  
And then this invisible

  
and intangible

  
and incredibly influential X industry

  
can finally stop being part of the problem

  
and become part of the solution

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
In the mids two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog

  
Stretching  meters into the sky

  
these ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge

  
But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania

  
they first had to be dismantled
packaged and shipped piece by piece

  
over  kilometers away

  
Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent

  
was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss

  
the project's lead engineers

  
Even before construction began 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition

  
The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor

  
an even more vulnerable target

  
Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business

  
and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery

  
Worse still many engineers thought
the project was impossible

  
The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to kilometerperhour winds

  
swirling tides an endless blanket of fog

  
and the earthquakeprone 
San Andreas fault

  
But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built;

  
and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters

  
more reliable passage to the city

  
He was however a bit out of his depth

  
Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge

  
This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end

  
and extended horizontally
like a diving board

  
Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight

  
Strauss’s design used two cantilevers
linked by a structure in the middle

  
But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss

  
to pursue a different approach
the suspension bridge

  
Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end

  
a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap

  
The result is a more flexible structure

  
that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads

  
This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges

  
And in the s 
advanced steel manufacturing

  
could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope

  
for largescale construction

  
At the time the Golden Gate Bridge

  
was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted

  
and its design was only possible
due to these innovations

  
But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks

  
on the country’s east coast

  
While the recently completed Panama Canal

  
made it possible to ship these components
to California

  
reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly

  
It was relatively easy to find a stable
shallow foundation for the north tower

  
But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting

  
a tenstory building underwater

  
Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations

  
bombs were dropped on the ocean floor
creating openings for pouring concrete

  
A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents

  
and workers operated in minute shifts
between tides

  
The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans

  
to prevent getting lost

  
And at one point an earthquake rocked
the south tower

  
nearly  meters in each direction

  
Strauss took worker safety very seriously
requiring hard hats at all times

  
and stretching a safety net 
below the towers

  
But not even these precautions 
could prevent

  
an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 

  
carrying ten workers to their deaths

  
Once the towers were complete 
workers spun the cables in place

  
hung suspenders at foot intervals
and laid down the concrete roadway

  
The bridge was finished
but there was still one more task ahead

  
painting it

  
After production the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer

  
it maintained throughout construction

  
But the Navy had been pushing hard

  
to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow

  
Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself

  
paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone

  
Citing numerous letters from locals

  
Morrow’s page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange”

  
beat out the Navy’s plans

  
And today this iconic color 
still complements

  
the strait’s blue water green hills 
and rolling fog

  
When we look at poor
smallholder farmers across the world

  
and particularly in my country India

  
we often think that what they need
is access to better tools

  
education government support
markets and so on

  
Yes they need all that

  
But what they really need
is a reliable and regular income

  
to live with dignity

  
A dependable income

  
even if it is as small
as  dollars a month

  
is essential for them
to stay out of poverty

  
Today their incomes
are in and out of poverty

  
which is extremely painful

  
Growing up in South India

  
I could not overlook
what poverty did to our farmers

  
I was about  years old when one day

  
I saw a farmer in my village
sitting next to a farm stream

  
and eating something from the ground

  
Something did not seem right

  
I walked up to him
to see what was going on

  
I was shocked to see him eat mud

  
Mud

  
Brown soft mud from the stream

  
I was afraid he might die

  
I yelled at him

  
"What is this stupid mudeating business"

  
He looked at me helplessly and said

  
"I'm a farmer my crops failed;

  
my stomach doesn't know
that my pocket is empty"

  
I walked away quite helplessly

  
That night I shared this
with my grandfather

  
He was a remarkable man very clever

  
He was a part of the Indian
freedom struggle

  
under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi

  
Unlike me he wasn't surprised at all

  
He knew of people
who added rice starch to mud

  
to calm their hunger

  
And he told me something profound

  
If you see a person walking
on the road without footwear

  
it is important to understand
the root cause

  
that the person doesn't have enough money
to probably buy the footwear

  
I finished my college

  
started working with a big company

  
but that incident kept coming back to me

  
Why are smallholder farmers
in such abject poverty

  
What causes them to be so desperate

  
and why is it that
even in stcentury India

  
one farmer dies by suicide
every  minutes

  
My cofounders and I spent about six months
traveling across India

  
meeting hundreds of farmers
to listen to them

  
It became clear that climate risk
is the root cause

  
that causes farming to be
unpredictable and unviable

  
Farmers who make
reasonable money in one season

  
can fail miserably in the next

  
And farmers who could grow crops
earlier in summers

  
no longer get to grow crops in summers

  
Heat is so much more

  
The wells are drying up

  
every year there are new varieties
of pests and diseases

  
Farmers told us that this is all
because of because of God

  
I said "What"

  
"This is all because of God"

  
God is the one who caused it
God is the only one who can solve it

  
God in that context
I did not see as a sign of hope

  
I read it as a sign of helplessness

  
We heard from the farmers

  
They knew the problem

  
but they could not use
these two words "climate risk"

  
So we got together a team of engineers

  
scientists designers
from about six countries

  
to cocreate a solution with our farmers

  
which is quite unconventional

  
And the solution is “greenhouseinabox”

  
We call it "Kheyti Rakshak"

  
It’s a microgreenhouse

  
It's a beautiful greenhouse

  
which sits in a small portion
of the farmer's land

  
It's easy to build a small structure

  
covered with netting on all sides

  
which cuts off heat
prevents bugs and saves water

  
We can't cool the entire
planet in one day

  
but we definitely can create a climate
for a small portion of a farmer’s land

  
to be suitable for farming

  
From our first experiences
of growing vegetables 

  
staple vegetables like tomatoes
cabbage cucumbers 

  
we observed that greenhouses
can increase yields up to seven times

  
and use  percent less water

  
All this was too good to be true

  
All these things
are so difficult to happen

  
so farmers couldn't believe it
unless they actually saw it in action

  
So to make this happen

  
we had to have the courage
to reimagine agriculture 

  
reimagine agriculture
for smallholder farmers

  
After all this is not to grow tomatoes
in an industrial setting in Alaska

  
in winters

  
It is to grow tomatoes
for a smallholder farmer

  
by a smallholder farmer
in sizzling hot Indian summers

  
So this greenhouse had to be small enough
to fit in a portion of their land

  
easy enough for them to use

  
and cheap enough for them to buy

  
One of the biggest challenges
that we could overcome in the process

  
is financing

  
Thanks to our financing partners

  
today this greenhouse
is available with financing

  
which is fast enough and cheap enough

  
The greenhouse costs about  dollars

  
Farmers pay a down payment
of about  dollars

  
and the rest is financed through a loan

  
And this lifechanging asset

  
adds and extra  dollars of profit
on average to a household

  
month on month

  
This is a good double
of what they otherwise make

  
Marginal fiveten percent increases
in the incomes of smallholder farmers

  
cannot move the needle forward much

  
because the baseline is way too low

  
We need a significant
jump in their income

  
and that income has to be
reliable and dependable

  
To ensure that farmers succeed

  
we also provide quality seeds nutrition

  
training and advisory
leveraging mobile technology

  
We rolled out the solution
after quite a few tests with farmers

  
about three years ago

  
and we are marching towards
 farmers in this year

  
and looking at  farmers
over the next five years

  
Hopefully every smallholder
farmer in my lifetime

  
(Applause)

  
The best technologies in agriculture
can reach the smallest of the farmers

  
if we do two things well

  
listen to the farmer with curiosity
empathy and compassion

  
and keep smallholder farmers
particularly women farmers

  
at the center of the design

  
and build solutions

  
Then we can cocreate
mini solutions like Kheyti Rakshak

  
which bring dignity hope and stability
to the lives of the farmers

  
In this big fight against climate change

  
we all have to remember that we should
take our smallholder farmers along;

  
it is our collective responsibility

  
India is a home for about  million
smallholder farmers

  
I dream of a day

  
when "smallholder farmer" becomes
synonymous with a happy farmer

  
and being forced to eat mud
should never be a feature again anywhere

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Yuchi F’as@^

  
English Good afternoon

  
I come from the Yuchi
and Anishinaabe nations

  
My home is in Oklahoma

  
I have been a community organizer
for Indigenous rights

  
environmental justice and climate justice

  
for more than  years

  
I don't believe that I'm old enough
to do anything for that long

  
but here I am

  
(Applause)

  
I'm an Indigenous woman who lives
in the heart of oil and gas country

  
And what that means for me
is that I am in a constant state

  
of thinking about the environment
and climate change

  
And so I want to share
a few things that I know

  
and have learned
along the way in my work

  
One is

  
we cannot rely on those
who created the problem to fix it

  
(Applause)

  
Two we need to move with an urgency
that is not happening now

  
And three

  
we need leaders
who are experiencing the harm

  
to be the ones coming up
with the solutions

  
So it is clear that world leaders
are looking for solutions

  
to this climate crisis

  
but they are looking for them
through a lens of the economy

  
And so that means they are moving
with a casualness

  
that doesn't make it seem
like there's a real emergency

  
And they’re also being sold then
solutions that are basically bandaids

  
and not actual cures to the problem

  
They're being sold techno fixes
and market schemes

  
that really maintain business as usual

  
And instead

  
we need to be thinking
about what could be different

  
So I was recently at the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change COP

  
that just happened in Glasgow Scotland
just this past month

  
And it was apparent to me

  
that those who created the agenda
are also part of the problem

  
First of all

  
they created an admittance policy
that was really a policy of exclusion

  
for many grassroots communities
across the world

  
and especially those of the global south

  
That policy also ensured

  
that the largest badge delegation at COP
were fossil fuel lobbyists

  
Can you believe that

  
Actually I can

  
because this has been sort of the norm
at COP since its beginning

  
Which is why we need a shift

  
in who are the leaders
that they're listening to

  
And the shift in leadership
are coming up with the solutions

  
We need the knowledge and expertise
of those at the frontline

  
And by frontline

  
I mean those communities and peoples
who are experiencing climate change today

  
and some who have been experiencing
the harmful effects of climate change

  
for decades now

  
Those are the frontline leaders

  
that we need to be looking to
for their expertise

  
So I want you to imagine with me

  
if at that negotiating table at COP

  
if those who were dealing
with the actual harms today

  
were in that room
and negotiating the solutions

  
What if the people who have been
living sustainable lifestyles

  
and in relationship with the land

  
had been some of those folks
in the room making those decisions

  
What would it have been like

  
if grassroots leaders had been given
significant participation

  
in those negotiations

  
What would be different

  
Well first off

  
this global climate conference
would not have led with netzero

  
as the solution to this
climate crisis we're in

  
Netzero  not actually eliminating
greenhouse gas emissions 

  
but netzero being a sort of greenwashing
of business as usual

  
It basically means that you can
wash your hands of pollution

  
in one community

  
if you can afford to participate
in a few offset programs

  
So for example

  
you can invest in the continued existence
of a forest in South America

  
of Indigenous peoples in their lands
that should capture carbon

  
What it means then you are in theory

  
obligated from the harm
that you've caused a pollution

  
at a facility in another
lowincome community 

  
and very likely community of color 
in another part of the world

  
That's just wrong

  
And it just doesn't work

  
I mean I know people real people

  
I know their names and their families
on both ends of the spectrum

  
of the netzero spectrum

  
I know people who live at the fence line
of harmful oil refineries

  
who are polluting their communities

  
and I know the Indigenous people
who are farming the forests in Brazil

  
And neither of those communities
are benefiting from these programs

  
in ways that are building empowerment
for their communities

  
and building sustainability
for their communities

  
and they're often pressured
into these programs

  
with little or no choice

  
So I want to try to explain
netzero a little bit differently

  
in a way that might be
a little more tangible

  
If you think about it as kind of
like the net part of your paycheck

  
You get a job you negotiate a pay

  
and you feel really excited about that

  
But on that first day that first payday

  
you feel the crunch of it's a lot less
than you thought it was going to be

  
And it's the same with the netzero
emission targets right

  
It sounds good on the front end

  
but when it all comes out in the wash

  
it's much less than what
we need to have happen

  
to impact real significant
change right now

  
So what we need is a shift in leadership

  
We need leaders who are moving
with the urgency

  
that people are feeling harm
and hurt today

  
And we need leaders who are moving
with the values about community

  
and about the land
and the relationship with land

  
Those are the kind of leaders that we need
to have leading with the solutions

  
and the negotiations of addressing
this problem on a worldwide level

  
So that kind of leadership

  
if we just shifted those two things
about urgency and values

  
that would help all of us worldwide

  
Because what we need
is a set of leadership

  
that is going to do the work
that we need to have done

  
which is to move away from dirty
extractive harmful energy

  
to solutions that are local
communitybased communityheld

  
regenerative energy models

  
And they exist

  
They exist in communities
where people are saying

  
"Hey if the government
is not going to help us

  
we’re going to do
what we need to do right now”

  
And they are doing these projects
in their communities

  
So instead of investing
in a carbon capture project

  
that aims to put carbon
pollution into the ground

  
a technology that's not been
proven to really work

  
and still puts communities at harm

  
because it relies on the continued
existence and construction

  
of harmful pipelines that are dangerous

  
prone to leaks and even
explosions sometimes

  
And so 

  
But these community projects
are happening and they're having success

  
and I want to share a few with you

  
So in Richmond California 

  
between two cities

  
and next to a major Chevron oil refinery

  
that is spewing out greenhouse gases

  
and other toxic chemicals
into the neighborhood 

  
community leaders worked
with community organizations

  
like Asian Pacific Environmental Network

  
Rich City Rides Urban Tilth

  
and Communities for a Better Environment

  
And they took on Chevron
to hold them accountable and won

  
And won resources to build
a solar farm in their community

  
They also built a bike coop

  
to encourage young people
and others to bike in the city

  
and built community gardens

  
to grow healthy organic food
for themselves and schools

  
(Applause)

  
In rural Kentucky a community

  
a rural community who has long relied
on coal to fuel their community

  
they've been organizing with Kentuckians
for the Commonwealth

  
and also created a solar project

  
that is helping lowincome families
reduce their utility costs

  
and created thousands of jobs

  
In the Four Corners area of Arizona
Native Renewables

  
a womanled Navajo Hopi organization

  
is providing electricity
from solar to offgrid homes

  
A community that has long been harmed

  
by the devastating effects
of fossil fuel extraction

  
is now able to rely on an energy source
that is clean and Indigenousled

  
(Applause)

  
After hurricane Maria devastated
the islands of Puerto Rico

  
Organización Boricuá worked
with local farmers

  
to provide direct and immediate
support to those communities

  
by providing water shelter

  
health food

  
the weekly agro ecological
brigades and solidarity brigades

  
and they rebuilt homes
and rebuilt farming infrastructure

  
to make sure that they maintained
food sovereignty

  
In Brooklyn New York

  
in a highly industrial
neighborhood of Sunset Park

  
the community organization UPROSE

  
helped lead an effort
to create a solar farm

  
a first community solar coop
in the state of New York

  
It is an  square foot
rooftop solar garden

  
that again is providing
affordable energy to the neighborhood

  
and to small businesses as well

  
The fight against the Line  pipeline
in Minnesota and other states

  
has highlighted the amount of water
that those types of projects have used

  
And it's caused a threat
to the natural wild rice

  
that grows in the lakes there

  
And so community people
have worked to hold state

  
and federal agencies accountable
for water standards

  
in order to protect
their cultural preservation

  
and the wild rice

  
And in New Jersey
Ironbound Community Corporation

  
along with the New Jersey
Environmental Justice Alliance

  
has helped push legislation

  
that has enabled the state
to deny permits

  
any new permits to already
overburdened overpolluted neighborhoods

  
And it's set a standard
for other states to use

  
which has become a historic environmental
justice legislation for the country

  
These are the kinds of solutions
that we need to see happen

  
These are the kind of leadership
that we need to see happen

  
and we need these solutions happening
by the thousands nationwide

  
and even globally

  
Because these solutions
are not only attacking

  
the emissions at their source

  
but they're doing it by providing jobs

  
and wages and policies

  
that are addressing racism
and colonialism and economic inequity

  
This is the kind of leadership we need

  
We need this dramatic
shift to help us all

  
This dramatic shift in leadership

  
Just these two things

  
The urgency in which we move

  
and the values on which we move with

  
My grandmothers taught me
that we need to have care

  
responsibility and action
when it comes to our community

  
And those are the kind of leaders
that we need leading this fight

  
And if we are going to be serious
about addressing this climate crisis

  
here are the steps
that I need people to do

  
I need you to bring frontline leaders
into those negotiating spaces

  
Bring them in

  
Ask them what's happening
and the harms that are happening

  
Ask them what needs to be done

  
And listen hear them

  
And then invest and implement
in exactly what they said

  
in the exact ways they said to do it

  
because those changes are the changes

  
that are going to stop the problems
that we're having

  
and then stop the acceleration
of the climate crisis

  
And it's going to help slow down
the violence of the storms

  
and the sicknesses
that people are dealing with

  
with conditions like asthma and others

  
And it's going to stop you know

  
the continued drought and wildfires

  
Those are the solutions
that we need to have happen

  
And I need you all to help carry

  
not only the ask to shift that
for our communities

  
but also those values

  
So I ask you I invite you
to join me in this

  
and I challenge you to go out

  
and challenge our elected
leaders and others

  
And if they're not doing the right job

  
then tell them who the leaders are
that need to be there

  
We need frontline leaders
to be in the spaces

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Have you ever trodden
on a Lego brick in your bare feet

  
You’re tiptoeing through
your lounge late at night

  
and suddenly that stabbing pain

  
the expletives

  
and the inevitable question

  
“Why do we have so much of this stuff
all over the place”

  
Well that’s really quite simple

  
Your kids love playing with it

  
so you buy more

  
And a confession 

  
I love to watch my kids play with Lego

  
Especially good is when
I see them inventing their own rules

  
and their own worlds

  
So here are my daughters

  
last Saturday

  
making something out of different kits

  
and pieces of string

  
and pieces of wood and dolls
and other objects

  
And I asked them “What is it”

  
And they said to me “Dad of course
it’s a princess flying on a dragon

  
to visit farm animals in New York”

  
Of course what else could it be

  
Kids at play inspire me

  
They’re not afraid to ask “What if”

  
and “Why not”

  
But what kids implicitly know
that adults tend to forget

  
is that play isn’t just about fun

  
Now as a biologist I know that play
is spontaneous and pleasurable 

  
as you can see by the smiles
in this photograph 

  
but also it accelerates
and derisks learning

  
It helps kids to try out new behaviors

  
to refine those behaviors

  
and to imagine what is not

  
but what could be or what will be

  
As a business strategist
dealing with adults

  
I still recommend play

  
In fact play in business
is not just possible

  
I’d argue that it’s essential

  
and even urgent

  
And here’s why

  
Competitive advantage fades away
faster than any time in recent memory

  
In the s

  
if you had a performance edge
over your competitors

  
you could reasonably expect to continue
being a leader for around  years

  
on average

  
But now the halflife of that advantage
has shrunk to just one year

  
That means that shortlived success
is actually still very common

  
but sustained success  becomes very hard

  
and very rare

  
That means that actually reimagination
is the new execution

  
In order to stay on top

  
or even just to tread water
and stay still

  
you need to constantly
reimagine your business

  
But that’s not so simple

  
if you already have
a highly successful business model

  
We become prisoners of the mental models
that underpin our past success

  
In fact I found
in dealing with businesses

  
that you can’t really
stretch your strategy

  
unless you stretch your mind

  
Now play is of course a great way
of stretching your mind

  
Now 

  
I mean there’d be no mistake

  
I’m not suggesting literally

  
that executives huddle around
a conference table

  
with a big pile of Lego bricks 

  
although I’ve done that
and that works too

  
But instead I’ve created a series
of imagination games

  
to help executives
to stretch their thinking

  
Would you like to play with me

  
(Audience nods)

  
Good I'm glad you said that

  
OK so let’s supposing
that you’re stuck in the rut

  
of seeing the world through the lens
of your past and current success

  
I would recommend the “AntiCompany Game”

  
and here’s how it works

  
You get a piece of paper

  
you create a list of everything
which is essential to your strategy 

  
everything which underpinned
your past success

  
everything which is core and sacred 

  
and then you flip it

  
You create the exact
mirrorimage list of assumptions

  
and then you make the best
business case for this antiself

  
You’ll be surprised
at the ideas that it triggers

  
Supposing for example
that you’re the CEO of a hotel chain

  
and playing the game
and flipping the assumptions

  
Let’s assume that inconveniently

  
you don’t actually own any hotels

  
or any rooms

  
or even operate any hotels
or any rooms anywhere

  
Ridiculous 

  
quite possibly 

  
but actually how would you know
the difference between ridiculous

  
and the merely unfamiliar
untried and uncomfortable

  
And who’s to say

  
that something that seems impractical
can’t actually become and evolve

  
into a more powerful idea

  
Actually had the executives of hotels
played the “AntiCompany Game”

  
before 

  
they might have been able to foresee
the appearance of Airbnb

  
the hotelless hospitality company

  
and they might have been able
to stave off disruption

  
by preemptively disrupting themselves

  
Let’s play another game

  
“The Maverick Game”

  
On the edge of your industries 

  
on the edge of every industry 

  
are a population of maverick companies

  
that are taking a bet against
the incumbents’ business model

  
and their view of the future

  
Actually they have no choice

  
because to be a miniature version
of the incumbent would not be viable

  
Now it’s easy not to notice them 

  
many of them are small companies

  
It's easy to deliberately overlook
them with some justification

  
Many startups disappear fairly quickly
after being founded

  
And it’s very very tempting

  
given all of your experience
in the business

  
to judge them

  
Do they know what they’re doing

  
Does their business model make sense

  
Will they ever make any money

  
But instead of judging them
from the comfort

  
and the confidence of your position

  
try assuming that it’s they that have
the right bet on the future

  
Think about the consequences
of that for your business model

  
Try making the best case for their idea

  
Supposing for example

  
that you are the CEO of a company

  
that makes equipment
that makes semiconductors

  
Naturally you’d probably spend
most of your time and attention

  
on your main customer industry

  
the electronics industry

  
And if it so happened

  
that a couple of maverick
bioscience companies

  
were tinkering with your patents
and your technologies

  
you might overlook that
as a distraction

  
an irrelevance

  
But actually Brooks Automation

  
a leader in the field

  
decided to take a closeup look
at such a group of mavericks

  
to see whether it could learn anything

  
And what it realized

  
by looking at the world
through the eyes of these mavericks

  
was that actually the same techniques

  
and technologies which can be used
to handle delicate semiconductors

  
can also be applied to other fragile
and easily contaminated materials

  
like biological samples

  
And puzzling on the significance of this

  
they reimagined how to handle
and store and transport

  
and label and identify biological samples

  
In fact they became a successful pioneer

  
in the new industry
of automated biobanking

  
So successful in fact
that just a couple of days ago

  
they announced that this was now
their core business moving forwards

  
It’s only by focusing
on these anomalous mavericks

  
that they could see their own path
to renewed success and growth

  
Now not everything in business
goes according to plan

  
In fact sometimes the plans
go horribly awry

  
But you know what

  
That can be a source of inspiration too

  
To find out how

  
let’s play the “PreMortem Game”

  
So your role in this game is to write 

  
the obituary for your company

  
which is going to fail
with  percent certainty

  
in five years’ time

  
What is the cause of death

  
What will have been the point of failure

  
Why will it have failed

  
How will it have failed

  
The challenge here is that it’s easy
to be seduced into the baseline fallacy

  
The baseline fallacy is the idea

  
that it’s the current business model
which is the lowrisk bet

  
And of course that tends to be true

  
until it isn’t true

  
at which point it’s probably too late
to do anything about it

  
Now your employees
are an earlywarning indicator

  
They will have intuitions
if the model begins to slip

  
but it’s very hard for them to speak up

  
And it’s even taboo for them to speak up

  
when the business model is under pressure

  
But when executives create playgrounds 

  
spaces for the safe exploration
of alternatives

  
and alternative scenarios 

  
then you get to tap into your employees’
considerable experience

  
about the vulnerabilities

  
and the weak spots

  
and the blind spots of your company

  
Does anyone remember visiting recently
one of these gorgeous marble palaces

  
No

  
It’s probably been a while since
we visited the local banking branch

  
Had bricksandmortar banks
played the “PreMortem Game”

  
perhaps they would have heard
their employees expressing some concerns

  
about the gradually dwindling
flow of customers to local branches

  
And perhaps they would have been
slightly less taken by surprise

  
when companies like NewBank

  
a digital native

  
seized very rapidly indeed
on that opportunity

  
to convince to date
more than  million Latin Americans

  
that inperson transactions
in real buildings

  
were a quaint but obsolete
relic of the past

  
It’s only when you bring
your vulnerabilities into full view

  
in this way

  
that you may be motivated
to reimagine your business

  
and to do so in a robust manner

  
It’s why the Roman Catholic Church
invented the role

  
the position of the Devil’s advocate
in the th century

  
to test the future consequences
of its decisions to appoint new saints

  
They did that by imagining

  
what would Satan say

  
or propose

  
or counterpropose

  
in addition to the normal procedure
of thinking about the big man upstairs

  
Now any human being
any employee any team

  
and therefore any company
can harness human imagination

  
It’s a defining trait of our species

  
Failures to imagine in business
are really failures of leadership

  
Business is a serious matter
but it should not exclude play

  
When leaders embrace play
and imagination games

  
they can unlock the imagination
of their employees

  
uncover disruptive new strategies

  
and renew their lease on the future

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Imagine a world in which China
was an environmental leader

  
That would be a more
hopeful world wouldn't it

  
When we hear about China

  
we usually hear about human rights
trade disputes toxic pollution

  
And I'm not here to dispute the news

  
Instead what I want to do

  
is share with you evidence
based on personal experience

  
of where China is leading

  
ClientEarth the environmental law
organization that I set up

  
has a person office in Beijing

  
We work as trusted partners
with the Ministry of Environment

  
We train judges and we train prosecutors
in environmental prosecutions

  
Let me share with you how this all began

  
In 

  
I was invited to Brussels to meet
a group of Chinese officials

  
They said they wanted to meet CEOs
of Western environmental groups

  
because they were looking to encourage
more environmental groups in China

  
Shortly after that
I was invited to Beijing

  
by the Supreme People's Court
the highest court in the land

  
The judges were working
on regulations for a new law

  
that would allow
Chinese environmental NGOs

  
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
They were interested in my advice

  
because of my extensive
environmental litigation experience

  
in Europe and in America

  
They wanted to know they said

  
what it would take to really make
such a system work

  
I found myself
in a conference room in Beijing

  
with three justices of the Supreme Court

  
and senior officials
of the Ministry of Environment

  
and the People's Congress
which is the Chinese parliament

  
"Before we get into details" I said
"I want to compliment you

  
It is amazing that you are writing a law

  
to allow Chinese environmental groups
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
This is revolutionary"

  
(Laughter)

  
The senior judge said "Mr Thornton
'revolutionary' is a big word for us"

  
(Laughter)

  
So we laughed

  
And in that human moment
I realized I could work with these people

  
He said "Consider it a sea change"

  
So for the next three months or so

  
my team and I worked
very closely with the judges

  
designing recommendations
for how to make the system really deliver

  
for citizens enforcing the law

  
One of the key provisions
we worked on involved costs

  
Now it costs money to bring
environmental litigation

  
and what really kills you is

  
if when you lose you have to pay
the other side's costs

  
as you do in the UK

  
We said this was only going to work
for the Chinese environmental groups

  
if when they won a case

  
they had all of their costs
paid by the polluters

  
but when they lost they would not
have to pay any of the polluters’ costs

  
Because win or lose

  
they were asserting the interests
of the public at large

  
Three months after that I found myself
back in a meeting in Beijing;

  
this time in the Supreme Court building
just off Tiananmen Square

  
I was there with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
We were sitting at a white marble table
that seemed to be  feet long

  
Across from us were three
Supreme Court judges

  
A senior judge began the meeting

  
by saying that they had accepted
almost all of our recommendations

  
including the key recommendation on costs

  
So at one stroke

  
the Chinese system became friendlier
to citizen environmental groups

  
trying to enforce the law

  
than many countries

  
The senior judge then said
"What do you want to do next for China"

  
Now on my prior trip

  
I had learned that the Chinese
had just appointed

  
 environment court judges

  
Now environment judges specialists
are rare around the world

  
In Europe for example
there's just a handful in Scandinavia

  
Their idea was that by appointing
all of these specialist judges

  
they would hear a vast volume of cases

  
and raise the quality of the rule of law
for the environment in China quickly

  
"So" I said "you might want
to train those judges"

  
They then asked us to train the judges

  
But I had never trained
a judge in my life

  
So I said “Where shall we start”

  
"With us" he said

  
"With the Supreme Court"

  
"Yes"

  
"But what do you want to learn"

  
"Well" he said "we want you to come back

  
and give us a seminar
on climate litigation

  
because you're an expert in that"

  
I said "Gladly but what's the thought
behind your request"

  
And he said

  
“We want to know the best
climate change cases in the world

  
because we want to decide
some of the best climate change cases

  
here in China"

  
Now I can assure you that I had never
had such a conversation

  
with the Supreme Court in Washington 

  
(Laughter)

  
or even London or Paris

  
Certainly nowhere other than Beijing

  
So we teamed up with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
to create a ClientEarth office in Beijing

  
He then organized this training seminar
for the Supreme Court

  
where we discussed trends
in climate litigation around the world

  
He then organized training sessions

  
for all of those specialist
environment court judges

  
Now more such judges have been
appointed in the meantime

  
and as of today

  
we've trained more than 
of these judges

  
(Applause)

  
About a year after we started
training the judges

  
a prosecutor came to our office and said

  
"In that law that you helped write

  
we the prosecutors got the right to sue
the Chinese government

  
on behalf of the people
for environmental matters

  
and we've never had the right
to sue the government before"

  
ClientEarth on the other hand
sues governments all the time

  
(Laughter)

  
So they were asking us
to share with them

  
our experience of suing governments

  
This was the Chinese federal prosecutors
asking us to train them

  
to sue the Chinese government

  
(Laughter)

  
It is the most amazing request
I've ever had

  
(Laughter)

  
So of course we started
working with them

  
We've now trained over  prosecutors
in how to bring environmental cases

  
(Applause)

  
A few months ago (Laughs)

  
we got a letter handdelivered

  
from the prosecutors
to our Beijing office

  
Now what I'm told
by my friends in Beijing

  
ordinarily the last thing
in life you want to get

  
is a letter from the prosecutors

  
This however was a thankyou note

  
and what it said was "Thank you
for your cooperation with us

  
As a result of cooperating with you

  
we have brought in  alone

  
over  environmental cases"

  
Audience Whoa

  
(Applause)

  
 cases and the majority
of those cases

  
were brought against
government departments

  
Now the prosecutors have set up bureaus
all over the country

  
to keep pushing out this level of cases

  
to raise compliance standards
throughout the country

  
Now if this isn't a revolution
it's certainly a sea change

  
(Laughter)

  
Now whenever I talk about China
I'm always asked about coal

  
China burns more coal
than any other country

  
We're working on that

  
Following the money
we've been working for some years

  
with the largest banks
and financial institutions in China

  
The argument we've been making

  
is that coal is simply a bad
investment for them to make

  
Recently we had
a twoday seminar in Beijing

  
for these institutions

  
and it was very heartening to see

  
that that argument
that coal is a bad investment

  
has now been internalized
by these institutions

  
and taken into their own thinking

  
When it comes to enforcement

  
the prosecutors have a new
fantastic opportunity

  
Recently a government audit

  
found that many of the new
coalfired power stations

  
authorized in recent times in China

  
were authorized illegally
by provincial officials

  
who wanted to boost their balance sheet

  
Because these were illegally authorized

  
they are a perfect enforcement target

  
Now another major problem
is all of the coalfired power stations

  
that Chinese companies
have been planning to build

  
outside China in Belt and Road
development countries

  
So we've been working
alongside many others

  
with the Ministry of Environment

  
to try and figure out how you stop
all of those coalfired power stations

  
in the pipeline

  
And what is wonderful news
is that in September 

  
President Xi Jinping
at the UN General Assembly

  
announced that China
would not fund or build

  
any more coalfired
power stations outside China

  
(Applause)

  
We also have reason to believe 
and good reason I think 

  
that China’s own emissions
will hit their peaking plateau soon

  
and then will seriously
decline before 

  
Now does more need to be done in China

  
Certainly  a lot more and faster

  
just like in every other country

  
But what I've found heartening

  
are all of these changes to the system
that they've been making in recent years

  
All of these environment court judges

  
the tens of thousands of cases

  
many of them against
government departments;

  
the Ministry of Environment
getting enhanced powers;

  
the largest banks
and financial institutions

  
realizing that coal is a bad investment;

  
the president promising
no more coal outside China

  
We work in many countries
around the world

  
but I have never seen
the intense focus on systemic change

  
moving a country towards
environmental improvements

  
as I've seen in China

  
I'd like to think that I have
given you reasons for hope

  
China has certainly given me hope

  
Thank you

  
(Cheers and applause)

  
I’d like to dedicate this talk
to my three children

  
Phi Mack

  
and Ella Roberta

  
(Inhales)

  
If I stop breathing for two minutes

  
I would die

  
It is the simplest thing
that all of us do unconsciously

  
about  times a day

  
So normal

  
that we forget that breathing
is the essence of life

  
My daughter Ella Roberta

  
stopped breathing frequently

  
and was resuscitated
numerous times by me at home

  
and in hospital by her doctors

  
until suddenly on the th of February

  
three weeks after her ninth birthday

  
she took her final breath

  
Ella was a healthy clever
sporty and funny girl

  
She had a lot of musical ability

  
At the time of her passing

  
she already played a dozen instruments

  
She was exceptionally good at football

  
cycling skating swimming and dancing

  
Ella was a great writer

  
and she was also pretty good at art

  
At the time of her passing

  
she had a reading age of  years

  
When she was six

  
the simple act of breathing
became the biggest challenge of her life

  
I rushed Ella to hospital
 times in  months

  
when she suddenly began suffering
severe respiratory issues

  
She was diagnosed
with lifethreatening asthma

  
at the age of seven

  
She was admitted
into intensive care five times

  
and put in an induced coma
to save her life

  
when her lungs gave up on her

  
It wasn't until after
the first coroner's inquest

  
in September 

  
that I learned that her possible trigger
of her sudden illness

  
was to do with "something in the air"

  
But at that time
we did not know what it was

  
Ella had one of the worst
cases ever of asthma

  
recorded in the United Kingdom

  
according to the pathologist
who carried out her postmortem

  
We as a family we live  meters
from the South Circular

  
in southeast London

  
It is one of the busiest roads in the UK

  
I later learned that air
pollution around our home

  
was persistently far above the levels
deemed acceptable by the WHO

  
On every walk to school every bike ride

  
every time Ella went outside

  
her body was absorbing
invisible toxic air

  
spewed out by petrol and diesel vehicles

  
A second inquest into Ella’s death
just in December 

  
the coroner Philip Barlow

  
he concluded that it was the excessive
illegal levels of air pollution

  
not only inducted her asthma

  
but it was the highest ever
on the night she died

  
As a result of this

  
Ella is the first person in the world

  
to have air pollution
listed as a cause of death

  
on her death certificate

  
Ella's story is unique I admit

  
but her experience is shockingly ordinary

  
In too many countries around the world

  
air pollution exceeds

  
what the WHO tells us
is acceptable to breathe

  
Fossil fuels everyone
they're killing us

  
Almost one in five premature deaths

  
are linked to air pollution

  
from combustion engines
coal power plants

  
wood burning ammonia cooking stoves

  
and other fossil fuels

  
That is  million people a year
dying from heart attacks cancer strokes

  
dementia suicide depression
stillbirths and miscarriages

  
And that's just the start

  
Children are the worst affected
due to their lungs still developing

  
Air pollution stunts the development
of lungs and brains

  
Scientists believe it
are finding soot in mothers placentas

  
meaning unborn babies
are directly exposed to the black carbon

  
produced by motor traffic
and fuel burning

  
Like Ella  percent of children
around the world

  
are breathing unsafe air

  
The real tragedy of this is we know
how to solve this public health crisis

  
We need to shift from toxic fossil fuels

  
to clean electrified public
and active transport

  
The second inquest into Ella’s death
made it abundantly clear

  
Ella would still be here alive today

  
if air pollution around our home

  
had been within the WHO acceptable limits

  
Air pollution is an invisible
global pandemic

  
It's a silent killer

  
You know what
unless you clean up the air

  
you will never resolve climate change

  
Do you know why

  
It's linked to global warming

  
acid rain

  
effects on wildlife

  
depletion of the ozone layer

  
But for me this is personal

  
Eight years after Ella's death

  
I still visit respiratory doctors
with Ella’s siblings

  
who continue to be impacted
by excessive air pollution

  
As my children and I share a genetic link

  
we are equally susceptible
to air pollution

  
The WHO recently
strengthened its guidelines

  
and the evidence shows us
there is no such thing as safe levels

  
Every country in the world

  
must enshrine these new
WHO guidelines into law now

  
I'm putting them on notice

  
(Applause)

  
What do I want

  
I'll tell you what I want

  
I want every government
to guarantee their children

  
the chance to live full and healthy lives

  
To be able to fully and safely breathe

  
Breathing clean air
is every child's human right

  
Governments have a duty of care
to protect their citizens

  
Remember  million people
in the world have asthma

  
including me

  
(Breathing through inhaler)

  
The fight to breathe clean air is real

  
When I say "Breathe life"

  
what do you say

  
You say "Clean air is our right!"

  
Breathe life!

  
Audience Clean air is our right!

  
RAKD Thank you for listening

  
Thank you very much

  
(Applause and cheers)

Bruno Giussani We are at the end
of day six of the war in Ukraine

  
or more correctly
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
launched on February 
by President Vladimir Putin

  
We are all shocked
and saddened by the events

  
and by the human suffering
they are causing

  
And as we speak really

  
a Russian military convoy
is headed towards Kyiv

  
other Ukrainian cities
are being bombarded

  
half a million Ukrainians have already
fled to neighboring countries

  
and much more

  
It's still early days

  
and it's difficult to predict
how the situation will evolve

  
even just in the next few hours

  
But this is a war that should concern
everyone everywhere

  
And so today in this TED
Membership conversation

  
we want to try to give it
a broader context with our guest

  
historian and author Yuval Noah Harari

  
Yuval welcome

  
Yuval Noah Harari Hello

  
Thank you for inviting me

  
BG I want to start from Ukraine itself
and its  million people

  
and its particular place
between the East and the West

  
What do we need to know about Ukraine

  
to understand this war
and what's at stake

  
YNH The most crucial thing to know
is that Ukrainians are not Russians

  
and that Ukraine is an ancient
independent nation

  
Ukraine has a history
of more than a thousand years

  
Kyiv was a major metropolis
and cultural center

  
when Moscow was not even a village

  
For most of these thousand years
Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow

  
They were not part
of the same political entity

  
For centuries Kyiv was looking westwards

  
and was a part of a union
with Lithuania and Poland

  
until it was eventually conquered
and absorbed by the Russian Empire

  
by the czarist empire

  
But even after that

  
Ukrainians remained
a separate people to a large extent

  
and it's important to know that

  
because this is really
what is at stake in this war

  
The key issue of the war

  
at least for President Putin

  
is whether Ukraine
is an independent nation

  
whether it is a nation at all

  
He has this fantasy
that Ukraine isn't a nation

  
that Ukraine is just a part of Russia

  
that Ukrainians are Russians

  
In his fantasy

  
Ukrainians are Russians that want
to be back in the fold of Mother Russia

  
and that the only ones preventing it
is a very small gang at the top

  
which he portrays as Nazis

  
even if the president is Jewish;
but OK a Nazi Jew

  
And his belief was at least

  
that he just needs to invade

  
Zelenskyy will flee

  
the government will collapse

  
the army would lay down its arms

  
and the Ukrainian people
would welcome the Russian liberators

  
throwing flowers on them

  
And this fantasy
has been shattered already

  
Zelenskyy hasn’t fled

  
the Ukrainian army is fighting

  
And the Ukrainian people is not throwing
flowers on the Russian tanks

  
it's throwing Molotov cocktails

  
BG So let's unpack that

  
and maybe take the different
pieces one way one

  
So Ukraine has a long history
of being dominated and occupied

  
You mentioned the czar
but also the Soviet Union

  
Hitler's armies

  
It also has a long history of mistrust
of authority and of resistance

  
which goes some way to explain
the current strong resistance

  
that the Russians are encountering

  
Anne Applebaum the journalist
even suggests that this mistrust

  
this resistance to authority

  
is the very essence
of Ukraineness do you agree

  
YNH We did see in the last  years
Ukrainians twice rising in revolt

  
when there was a danger

  
of an authoritarian regime
being established 

  
once in  once in 

  
And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago

  
what really struck me
was this very strong feeling

  
of the desire for independence
and for democracy

  
And I remember walking around this museum

  
of the Revolution of 

  
and seeing these images
like these two elderly women

  
who were bringing sandwiches
to the demonstrators

  
to the fighters

  
They couldn’t throw stones
and they couldn’t do anything else

  
so they prepared sandwiches

  
and brought this huge tray
full of sandwiches

  
to the demonstrators

  
And this yes this is the kind of spirit

  
that inspires not just the Ukrainians

  
but everybody who is now watching
what is happening there

  
BG Help me understand
the actual nature of the threat here

  
in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine

  
So in your last book
when you write about Russia

  
you describe the Russian model as
“not a coherent political ideology

  
but rather a sort of practice
of monopolizing power and wealth

  
by a small group at the top"

  
But then in his actions against Ukraine

  
Putin in the last few weeks seems to move
very much by an ideology

  
an ideology of empire
of denial of Ukraine's right to exist

  
as you mention

  
What has changed in the four years
since you wrote that book

  
YNH The imperial dream was always there

  
but you know empires
are often the creation

  
of a very small gang of people at the top

  
I don’t think the Russian people
[are] interested in this war

  
I don't think that the Russian people
want to conquer Ukraine

  
or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv

  
It's all coming from the top

  
So there is no change there

  
I mean when you look at the Soviet Union

  
you can say that there was
this mass ideology

  
which was shared by a large proportion
or some proportion of the population

  
You don't see this now

  
You know Russia is a very rich country

  
rich in resources

  
but most people are very poor

  
Their standard of living is very very low

  
because all the wealth and power
is kind of sucked

  
by the people at the top

  
and very little is left
for everybody else

  
So I don't think it's a society

  
where the masses are part
of this kind of ideological project

  
They're being ruled from the top

  
And you have this classic
imperial situation

  
when the emperor

  
which controls the largest
country in the world

  
feels that "Hey this is not enough

  
I need more"

  
And sends his army to capture

  
to extend the empire

  
BG I said at the beginning

  
that it's difficult of course
to make predictions

  
But yesterday you published
an article in "The Guardian"

  
titled “Why Putin
has already lost this war”

  
Please explain

  
YNH Well one thing should be very clear

  
I don't mean to say

  
that he's going to suffer
an immediate military defeat

  
He definitely has the military
power to conquer Kyiv

  
and perhaps the whole of Ukraine

  
Unfortunately we might see this

  
But his longterm goal

  
the whole rationale of the war

  
is to deny the existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
and to absorb it into Russia

  
And to do that it's not enough
to conquer Ukraine

  
You also need to hold it

  
And it's all based
on this fantasy on this gamble

  
that most of the population
in Ukraine would agree to this

  
would even welcome this

  
And we already know that it's not true

  
That the Ukrainians
are a very real nation;

  
they are fiercely independent;

  
they don’t want to be part of Russia;

  
they will fight like hell

  
And in the longrun again
you can conquer a country

  
But as the Russians learned
in Afghanistan

  
as the Americans learned
also in Afghanistan also in Iraq

  
it's much harder to hold a country

  
And again the big question mark
before the war was always this

  
Before the war started
many things were already known

  
Everybody knew that the Russian army
is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army

  
Everybody knew that NATO will not send
armed forces into Ukraine

  
troops into Ukraine

  
Everybody knew that the West
the Europeans would be hesitant

  
about imposing too strict
a sanction regime

  
for fear of being hurt by it themselves

  
And this was the basis
for Putin's war plan

  
But there was one big unknown

  
Nobody could say for sure
how the Ukrainian people would react

  
And there was always the option

  
that maybe Putin's fantasy
would come true

  
Maybe the Russians will march in

  
Zelenskyy would flee

  
maybe the Ukrainian army
will just capitulate

  
and the population would not do much

  
This was always an option

  
And now we know this was just fantasy

  
Now we know that the Ukrainians
are fighting they will fight

  
And this derails the whole
rationale of Putin’s war

  
Because you can conquer
the country maybe

  
but you won't be able to absorb
Ukraine back into Russia

  
The only thing he's accomplishing

  
he is planting seeds of hatred

  
in the hearts of every Ukrainian

  
Every Ukrainian being killed

  
every day this war continues
is more seeds of hatred

  
that may last for generations

  
Ukrainians and Russians
didn't hate each other before Putin

  
They’re siblings

  
Now he's making them enemies

  
And if he continues
this will be his legacy

  
BG We're going to talk a bit
about that again later but you know

  
at the same time
Putin needs a victory right

  
The cost the human economic
political cost of this war

  
not even a week in
is already astronomical

  
So to justify it and also
to remain by the way

  
a viable leader at the head of Russia

  
Putin needs to win
and even win convincingly

  
So how do we square these things

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean the fact that you need to win
doesn't mean that you can win

  
Lots of political leaders need to win
and sometimes they lose

  
He could stop the war
declare that he won

  
and say that recognizing
Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians

  
is what he really wanted all along
and he achieved this

  
Maybe they cobble this agreement
or I don’t know

  
This is the job of politicians
I'm not a politician

  
But I can tell you that I hope
for the sake of everybody 

  
Ukrainians Russians
and the whole of humanity 

  
that this war stops immediately

  
Because if it doesn't

  
it's not only the Ukrainians
and the Russians

  
that will suffer terribly

  
Everybody will suffer terribly
if this war continues

  
BG Explain why

  
YNH Because of the shock waves
destabilizing the whole world

  
Let’s start with the bottom line

  
budgets

  
We have been living in an amazing era
of peace in the last few decades

  
And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy

  
You saw it in the bottom line

  
You saw it in the budgets

  
In Europe in the European Union

  
the average defense budget of EU members

  
was around three percent
of government budget

  
And that's a historical miracle almost

  
For most of history

  
the budget of kings and emperors
and sultans like  percent

  
 percent goes to war goes to the army

  
In Europe it’s just three percent

  
In the whole world the average
is about six percent I think

  
factcheck me on this
but this is the figure that I know

  
six percent

  
What we saw already within a few days

  
Germany doubles
its military budget in a day

  
And I'm not against it

  
Given what they are facing
it's reasonable

  
For the Germans for the Poles

  
for all of Europe to double their budgets

  
And you see other countries
around the world doing the same thing

  
But this is you know
a race to the bottom

  
When they double their budgets

  
other countries look and feel insecure
and double their budgets

  
so they have to double
them again and triple them

  
And the money that should go
to health care

  
that should go to education

  
that should go to fight climate change

  
this money will now go to tanks
to missiles to fighting wars

  
So there is less
health care for everybody

  
and there is maybe no solution
to climate change

  
because the money goes to tanks

  
And in this way
even if you live in Australia

  
even if you live in Brazil

  
you will feel the repercussions
of this war in less health care

  
in a deteriorating ecological crisis

  
in many other things

  
Again another very central
question is technology

  
We are on the verge
we are already in the middle actually

  
of new technological arms races
in fields like artificial intelligence

  
And we need global agreement
about how to regulate AI

  
and to prevent the worst scenarios

  
How can we get a global agreement on AI

  
when you have a new cold war
a new hot war

  
So in this field to all hopes

  
of stopping the AI arms race
will go up in smoke if this war continues

  
So again everybody around the world
will feel the consequences in many ways

  
This is much much bigger
than just another regional conflict

  
BG If one of Putin's goals here
is to divide Europe

  
to weaken the transatlantic alliance

  
and the global liberal order

  
he seems to kind of accidentally
have revitalized all of them in a way

  
USEU relations have never been
so close in many years

  
And so how do you read that

  
YNH Well again in this sense
he also lost the war

  
If his aim was to divide
Europe to divide NATO

  
he's achieved exactly the opposite

  
I mean I was amazed by how quick

  
how strong and how unanimous
the European reaction was

  
I think the Europeans
surprised themselves

  
You even see countries like Finland
and Sweden sending arms to Ukraine

  
and closing their airspace

  
They didn't even do it in the Cold War

  
It's really amazing to see it

  
I think another very important thing
is what has been dividing the West

  
over the several years now

  
it’s what people term the “culture war”

  
The culture war between left and right
between conservatives and liberals

  
And I think this war can be an opportunity

  
to end the culture war within the West

  
to make peace in the culture war

  
First of all because you suddenly realize
we are all in this together

  
There are much bigger things in the world

  
than these arguments
between left and right

  
within the Western democracies

  
And it's a reminder
that we need to stand united

  
to protect Western liberal democracies

  
But it's deeper than that

  
Much of the argument
between left and right

  
seemed to be in terms of a contradiction

  
between liberalism and nationalism

  
Like you need to choose

  
And the right goes with nationalism

  
and the left goes more liberalism

  
And Ukraine is a reminder that no
the two actually go together

  
Historically nationalism
and liberalism are not opposites

  
They are not enemies

  
They are friends they go together

  
They meet around the central value
of freedom of liberty

  
And to see a nation fighting
for its survival

  
fighting for its freedom

  
you see it on Fox News
or you see it in CNN

  
And yes they tell the story
a little differently

  
but they suddenly see the same reality

  
And they find common ground

  
And the common ground is to understand

  
that nationalism is not about hating
minorities or hating foreigners

  
it's about loving your compatriots

  
and reaching a peaceful agreement

  
about how we want
to run our country together

  
And I hope that seeing what is happening

  
would help to end
the culture war in the West

  
And if this happens we don't need
to worry about anything

  
You know when you look
at the real power balance

  
if the Europeans stick together

  
if the Americans and
the Europeans stick together

  
and stop this culture war
and stop tearing themselves apart

  
they have absolutely nothing to fear 
the Russians or anybody else

  
BG I'm going to ask you a question later
about the stories the West tells itself

  
but let me zoom out for a second
and get a larger perspective

  
You wrote another essay
last week in “The Economist”

  
and you argue that what's at stake
in Ukraine is and I quote you

  
"the direction of human history"

  
because it puts at risk what you call

  
the greatest political and moral
achievement of modern civilization

  
which is the decline of war

  
So now we are back in a war
and potentially afterwards

  
into a new form of cold war or hot war

  
but hopefully not

  
Elaborate about that essay you wrote

  
YNH Yeah I mean some people think

  
that all this talk
about the decline of war

  
was always just a fantasy

  
But 

  
Again you look at the statistics

  
Since 

  
there has not been a single clash
between superpowers

  
whereas previously in history

  
this was you know
the basic stuff of history

  
Since 

  
not a single internationally
recognized country

  
was wiped off the map
by external invasion

  
This was the common thing in history

  
Until then and then it stopped

  
This is an amazing achievement

  
which is the basis for everything we have

  
for our medical services

  
for education system

  
and this is all now in jeopardy

  
Because this era of peace

  
it wasn't the result of some miracle

  
It wasn't the result of a change
in the laws of nature

  
It was humans making better decisions
and building better institutions

  
which means also

  
that there is no guarantee for the future

  
If humans some humans
start making bad decisions

  
and start destroying
the institutions that kept the peace

  
then we will be back in the era of war

  
with budgets military budgets
going to    percent

  
It can happen

  
It's in our hands

  
And I'll just say one more thing

  
When not just me but other scholars
like Steven Pinker and others

  
talked about the era of peace

  
some people understood it
as kind of encouraging complacency

  
That oh we don't need
to worry about anything

  
No I mean the message
was really the opposite

  
It was a message of responsibility

  
If you think that there is no
era of peace in history

  
it's always war it's always the jungle

  
there is a constant level
of violence in nature

  
then this basically means

  
that there is no point
struggling for peace

  
and there is no responsibility
on leaders like Putin

  
because you can't blame Putin for the war

  
It's just a law of nature
that there are wars

  
When you realize no humans are able
to decrease the level of violence

  
then it should make us
much more responsible

  
And it should also make us understand

  
that the war in Ukraine now
it’s not a natural disaster

  
It’s a manmade disaster
and a single man

  
It's not the Russian people
who want this war

  
There's really just a single person

  
who by his decisions

  
created this tragedy

  
BG So one of the things
that has come back

  
in the last weeks and months
is the nuclear threat

  
It's moved back into the center
of political and strategic considerations

  
Putin has talked about it several times

  
the other day he ordered Russia's
nuclear forces on a higher alert status

  
President Zelenskyy himself
at the Munich Security Conference

  
essentially said that Ukraine
had made a mistake

  
abandoning the nuclear weapons
it had inherited from the Soviet Union

  
That's a statement that I suspect
many countries are pondering

  
What's your thinking about the return
of the nuclear threat

  
YNH It's extremely frightening

  
You know it's like it's almost Freudian

  
it's the return of the repressed

  
We thought that oh nuclear weapons yes

  
there was something
about that in the s

  
with the Cuban Missile Crisis
and Dr Strangelove

  
But no it's here

  
And you know it took just a few days

  
of difficulties on the battlefield

  
for suddenly 

  
I mean I'm watching
television like the news

  
and you have these experts
explaining to people

  
what different nuclear weapons will do
to this city or to this country

  
It rushed back in

  
So you know nuclear weapons are 

  
in a way they also until now
preserved the peace of the world

  
I belong to the school of thought
that if it was not for nuclear weapons

  
we would have had the Third World War

  
between the Soviet Union
and the United States and NATO

  
sometime in the s or 's

  
That nuclear weapons actually
until today served a good function

  
It's because of nuclear weapons

  
that we did not have any more
direct clashes between superpowers

  
because it was obvious
that this would be collective suicide

  
But the danger is still there
it's always there

  
If there is miscalculation

  
then the results could of course

  
be existential catastrophic

  
BG And at the same time you know
in the 's after Cuba and Berlin

  
and so in the 's but in the 's

  
we started building a sort of
international institutional architecture

  
that helped reduce the risk of military
confrontation of nuclear weapons

  
we used you know anything
from arms control agreements

  
to measures designed to build trust
or to communicate directly and so on

  
And then in the last decade or so

  
that has been progressively
kind of scrapped

  
so we are even in a more
dangerous situation

  
than we were let's say
at the end of the last century

  
YNH Completely I mean

  
we are now reaping
the bad fruits of neglect

  
that's been going on for several years

  
not just about nuclear
weapons but in general

  
about international institutions
and global cooperation

  
We’ve built in the late th century

  
a house for humanity

  
based on cooperation

  
based on collaboration

  
based on the understanding

  
that our future depends
on being able to cooperate

  
otherwise we will become
extinct as a species

  
And we all live in this house

  
But in the last few years we stopped 

  
we neglected it we stopped repairing it

  
We allow it to deteriorate more and more

  
And you know eventually it will 

  
It is collapsing now

  
So I hope that people will realize
before it's too late

  
that we need not just
to stop this terrible war

  
we need to rebuild the institutions

  
we need to repair the global house
in which we all live together

  
If it falls down we all die

  
BG So we have
among the audience listening

  
Rola from 

  
I don't know where she's from
she grew up in Lebanon 

  
and she said "I lived the war
I slept on the ground I breathed fear

  
All the reasons were explained to me
that the only remaining learning came

  
the war is absurd

  
We talk about strategy power budgets
opportunities technologies

  
What about human suffering
and psychological trauma"

  
Especially I assume what she's asking
is what about what's going to remain

  
in terms of the human suffering

  
and the psychological trauma
going forward

  
YNH Yeah I mean
these are the seeds of hatred

  
and fear and misery

  
that are being planted right now
in the minds and the bodies

  
of tens of millions
hundreds of millions of people really

  
Because it's not just
the people in Ukraine

  
it's also in the countries around
all over the world

  
And these seeds will give
a terrible harvest

  
terrible fruits in years
in decades to come

  
This is why it's so crucial
to stop the war immediately

  
Every day this continues
plants more and more of these seeds

  
And you know like this war now

  
its seeds were to a large extent

  
planted decades and even centuries ago

  
That part of the Russian fears
that are motivating Putin

  
and motivating people around him

  
is memories of past invasions of Russia

  
especially of course
in Second World War

  
And of course it's a terrible mistake

  
what they are doing with it

  
They are recreating again the same things
that they should learn to avoid

  
But yes these are still
the terrible fruits

  
of the seeds being planted in the s

  
BG It's what in same article you call

  
the fact that nations
are ultimately built on stories

  
So these seeds are the stories
we are starting to create now

  
The war in Ukraine
is starting to create the stories

  
that are going to have an impact
in the future that's what you're saying

  
YNH Some of the seeds of this war
were planted in the siege of Leningrad

  
And now it gives fruit
in the siege of Kyiv

  
which may give fruit
in  or  years in more terrible 

  
We need to cut this we need to stop this

  
You know as a historian

  
I feel sometimes ashamed
or responsible I don't know what

  
about what history the knowledge
of history is doing to people

  
In recent weeks I have been watching
all the world leaders talking with Putin

  
and very often he gave them
lectures on history

  
I think that Macron had a discussion
with him for five hours

  
and afterwards said “Most of the time
he was lecturing me about history”

  
And as a historian I feel ashamed

  
that this is what my profession
in some way is doing

  
I know it for my own country

  
In Israel we also suffer
from too much history

  
I think people should be
liberated from the past

  
not constantly repeating
it again and again

  
You know everybody should
kind of free themselves

  
from the memories of the Second World War

  
It's true of the Russians

  
it's also true of the Germans

  
You know I look at Germany now

  
and what I really want to say
if there are Germans watching us

  
what I really want to say to the Germans

  
guys we know you are not Nazis

  
You don't need to keep
proving it again and again

  
What we need from Germany now
is to stand up and be a leader

  
to be at the forefront
of the struggle for freedom

  
And sometimes Germans are afraid
that if they speak forcefully

  
or pick up a gun

  
everybody will say
"Hey you're Nazis again"

  
No we won't think that

  
BG That's happening right now

  
I mean lots of things that were
inconceivable just  days ago

  
have happened in the last few weeks

  
And one of the most striking
to me in any case

  
is Germany's reaction and transformation

  
I mean the new chancellor
Olaf Scholz the other day announced

  
that Germany will send arms to Ukraine

  
and will spend an extra  billion
dollars in building up its army

  
That reverses completely the principles

  
that have guided Germany's foreign policy

  
and security politics for decades

  
So that shift is happening exactly
at this moment and very very fast

  
YNH Yeah

  
And I think it's a good thing

  
We need the Germans to 

  
I mean they are now
the leaders of Europe

  
certainly after Britain left in Brexit

  
And we need them to in a way

  
let go of the past and be in the present

  
If there is really
one country in the world

  
that as a Jew as an Israeli
as a historian

  
that I trust it not to repeat
the horrors of Nazism

  
that's Germany

  
BG Yuval I want to touch
quickly on three things

  
that have to do with the fact
that this feels like

  
the first truly interconnected
war in many ways

  
The first of course is the basics

  
which is on one side
you have a very ancient war 

  
we have tanks and we have trenches
and we have bombed buildings 

  
and on the other we have
realtime visibility of everything

  
through cell phones and Twitter
and TikTok and so on

  
And you have written a lot
about this tension

  
between old ways and new tech

  
What's the impact here

  
YNH First of all we don't know
everything that is happening

  
I mean surprisingly with all this
TikTok and phones and everything

  
so much is not known

  
So the fog of war is still there and yes

  
there is much more information
but information isn’t truth

  
Lots of information is disinformation
and fake news and so forth

  
And yes it’s always like this;

  
the new and the old they come together

  
You know with all the talk
about interconnectedness

  
and living in cyberspace and all that

  
one of the most important technologies
not just of this war

  
but of the last decade or two
have been stone walls

  
It's Neolithic

  
Everybody is now building stone walls

  
in the era of Facebook
and Google and all that

  
So the old and the new they go together

  
And it's 

  
It is a new kind of war

  
People are sitting at home
in California or Australia

  
and they actively participate in the war

  
not just by writing tweets

  
but by attacking websites
or defending websites

  
You know in Spain in the Civil War

  
if you wanted to help fight fascism

  
then you had to go to Spain
and join the international brigade

  
Now the international brigade
is sitting at home in San Francisco

  
and is still in some way part of the war

  
So this is definitely new

  
BG So indeed just two days ago
Ukraine's deputy prime minister I think

  
Fedorov announced via Telegram

  
that he wanted to create
a sort of volunteer cyber army

  
He invited software developers and hackers

  
and other people with IT skills

  
to somehow help Ukraine
fight on the cyber front

  
And according to “Wired” magazine
in less than two days

  
 people signed up

  
So here is a defending nation
that can kind of recruit almost overnight

  
 volunteers
to go to battle on his behalf

  
It's a very different kind of war

  
YNH Yeah

  
You know every war brings it surprises

  
Sometimes it's how everything is new

  
but sometimes it's also
how everything is old

  
BG So a few people in the chat
and in the Q and A have mentioned China

  
which of course
is an important actor here

  
although for now is mostly an observer

  
But China has a stated policy
of opposing any act

  
that violates territorial integrity

  
So moving into Ukraine of course
violates territorial integrity

  
And it also has a huge interest
in a stable global economy

  
and global system

  
But then it needs to square this
with the recent closeness with Russia

  
Xi Jinping and Putin met in Beijing
before the Olympics for example

  
and kind of had this message of friendship
that went out to the world

  
How do you read China's position
in this conflict

  
YNH I don't know

  
I mean I'm not an expert on China

  
and I certainly can't just 

  
You know just reading the news
won't get you into the mindset

  
into the real opinions and positions
of the Chinese leadership

  
I hope that they take
a responsible position

  
And act 

  
because they are close to Russia

  
they are also close to Ukraine

  
but especially because
they are close to Russia

  
they have a lot of influence on Russia

  
I hope that they will be
the responsible adults

  
that will put down the flames of this war

  
They have a lot to lose

  
from a breakdown of the global order

  
And I think they have a lot to win
from the return of peace

  
including in terms of the gratitude
of the international community

  
Now whether they do it or not
this is with them

  
I can't predict but I hope so

  
BG You have mentioned before
the several European and Western leaders

  
that have gone to Moscow
in the weeks before the invasion

  
Varun in the chat asks

  
"Is the Ukraine war
a failure of diplomacy"

  
Could have 

  
Something different happened

  
YNH Oh you can understand it
in two questions

  
Did diplomacy fail to stop the war

  
Absolutely everybody knows that

  
But is it a failure in the sense
that a different diplomatic approach

  
some kind of other proposition
would have stopped the war

  
I don't know but it doesn't seem like it

  
I mean looking at the events
of the last few weeks

  
it doesn't seem that Putin
was really interested

  
in a diplomatic solution

  
It seemed that he was really
interested in the war

  
and I think again
it goes back to this basic fantasy

  
that if he really was concerned
about the security situation of Russia

  
then there was no need
to immediately invade Ukraine

  
There was no immediate threat to Russia

  
There was no discussion of right now
Ukraine joining NATO

  
There was no invasion army assembling
in the Baltic states or in Poland

  
Nothing

  
Putin chose the moment
to start this crisis

  
So this is why it doesn't seem

  
that it's really
about the security concerns

  
It seems more about this very deep fantasy

  
of reestablishing the Russian Empire

  
and of denying the very existence
of the Ukrainian nation

  
BG So you live in the Middle East

  
Someone else in the chat asks

  
"What makes the situation so unique

  
compared to many other wars
that are going on right now in the world"

  
I would say aside from the nuclear
threat from Russia but what else

  
YNH Several things

  
First of all

  
we have here again something
we haven't seen since 

  
which is a dominant power

  
trying to basically
obliterate from the map

  
an independent country

  
You know when the US invaded Afghanistan

  
or when the US invaded Iraq

  
you can say a lot of things about it

  
and criticize it in many ways

  
There was no question
of the US annexing Iraq

  
or turning Iraq into the st state
of the United States

  
This is what is happening in Ukraine

  
under this pretext or this disguise

  
this is what's at stake

  
The real aim is to annex Ukraine

  
If this succeeds

  
again it brings us back
to the era of war

  
I was struck by what
the Kenyan representative

  
to the UN Security Council said
when this erupted

  
The Kenyan representative spoke
in the name of Kenya

  
and other African countries

  
And he told the Russians

  
Look we also are the product
of a postimperial order

  
The same way the Soviet empire collapsed
into different independent nations

  
also African nations came out
of the collapse of European empires

  
And the basic principle
of African politics ever since then

  
was that no matter what your objections

  
to the borders you have inherited

  
keep the borders

  
The borders are sacred

  
because if we start invading
neighboring countries because

  
"Hey this is part of our countries

  
these people are part of our nation"

  
there will not be an end to it

  
And if this now happens in Ukraine

  
it will be a blueprint for copycats
all over the world

  
The other thing which is different
is that we are talking about superpowers

  
This is not a war
between Israel and Hezbollah

  
This is potentially a war
between Russia and NATO

  
And even leaving aside nuclear weapons

  
this completely destabilizes
the peace of the entire world

  
And again I go back again
and again to the budgets

  
That if Germany doubles
its defense budget

  
if Poland doubles its defense budget

  
this will spread to every
country in the world

  
and this is terrible news

  
BG So Yuval I'm jumping
from topic to topic

  
because I want to use the last few minutes

  
to ask a few questions from the audience

  
A few people are asking
about the link to the climate crisis

  
particularly when it relates
to the energy flows

  
Like Europe is very dependent

  
part of Europe is very dependent
on Russian oil and gas

  
which is as far as we know
still flowing until today

  
But could this crisis
in a sort of paradoxical way

  
a bit like the pandemic
accelerate climate action

  
accelerate renewables and and so on

  
YNH This is the hope

  
That Europe now realizes the danger

  
and starts a green Manhattan Project

  
that kind of accelerates
what already has been happening

  
but accelerates it

  
the development of better energy sources

  
better energy infrastructure

  
which would release it
from its dependence on oil and gas

  
And it will actually undercut
the dependence of the whole world

  
on oil and gas

  
And this would be the best way
to undermine the Putin regime

  
and the Putin war machine

  
because this is what Russia has

  
oil and gas

  
That's it

  
When was the last time you bought
anything made in Russia

  
They have oil and gas

  
and we know you know the curse of oil

  
That oil is a source of riches

  
but it’s also very often
a support for dictatorships

  
Because to enjoy the benefits of oil

  
you don't need to share it
with your citizens

  
You don't need an open society

  
you don't need education
you just need to drill

  
So we see in many places

  
that oil and gas are actually
the basis for dictatorships

  
If oil and gas if the price drops

  
if they become irrelevant

  
it will not only undercut the finance

  
the power of the Russian military machine

  
it will also force Russia

  
force Putin or the Russians
to change their regime

  
BG OK let me bring up a character

  
that everybody here in the chat
seems to find quite heroic

  
and that's the Ukrainian president

  
So Ukraine kind of finds itself

  
with a comedian who turned
almost accidental president

  
who turned now war president

  
But he has shown an impressive conduct
in the last few weeks

  
especially in the last few days

  
which can be summarized
in that response he gave to the US

  
when they offered
to kind of exfiltrate him

  
so he could lead a government in exile

  
he said "I need ammunition
I don't need a ride"

  
How would you look at President Zelenskyy

  
YNH His conduct
has indeed been admirable

  
and he gives courage and inspiration
not just to the Ukrainian people

  
but I think to everybody around the world

  
I think to a large extent

  
the swift and united reaction of Europe

  
with the sanctions
and sending arms and so forth

  
to a large extent this is also
to the credit of Zelenskyy

  
That you know

  
when politicians are also human beings

  
And his direct appeal to them

  
and you know they met him
many times in person

  
and to see where he is now

  
and the threat that not only him
but his family is also in

  
And you know they talk with him

  
and he says and they know
that this may be the last time they speak

  
He may be dead murdered or bombed
in an hour or in a day

  
It really changes something

  
So in this sense I think he made
a huge personal contribution

  
to not just the reaction in Ukraine
but around the world

  
BG So Sam who’s listening
asked this question

  
"Can you provide some historical context

  
for the force and the meaning
of economic and trade sanctions

  
at the level where they are
currently imposed

  
How have previous wouldbe empires
wouldbe aggressors or aggressors

  
been constrained by such
isolations and such sanctions"

  
YNH You know what we need
again to realize about Putin's Russia

  
is that it's not the Soviet Union

  
It's a much smaller and weaker country

  
It's not like in the s

  
that in addition to the Soviet Union

  
you had the entire Soviet bloc around it

  
So it's easier in this sense
to isolate it

  
It's much more vulnerable

  
Again does it mean that sanctions
would work like a miracle

  
and stop the tanks No

  
It takes time

  
But I think that the West is in a position

  
to impact Russia

  
with these kinds of sanctions
and isolation much more

  
than let's say with the Soviet Union

  
And also the Russian people are different

  
The Russian people
don't really want this war

  
even the people in the immediate
circle around Putin

  
You know again

  
I don't know them personally
from what it seems

  
it's that these people they like life

  
They have their yachts
and they have their private airplanes

  
and they have their house in London

  
and they have their chateau in France

  
And they like the good life

  
and they want to keep enjoying it

  
So I think that the sanctions
can be really effective

  
What's the timetable

  
That's ultimately in the hands of Putin

  
BG So Gabriella asks “I remember
the war in former Yugoslavia

  
and the atrocities there

  
Is there any possibility that this war
would escalate into such a situation"

  
I think an extension to that is

  
Is this war kind of stirring
dormant conflicts

  
like in the Balkans for example

  
or in the former Central Asian republic

  
YNH Unfortunately it can get
to that level and even worse

  
If you want an analogy go to Syria

  
You look at what happened in Homs

  
At what happened in Aleppo

  
And this was done by Putin
and his airplanes

  
and his minions in Syria

  
It's the same person behind it

  
And to think that "No no no
this happened in the Middle East

  
It can't happen in Europe"

  
No

  
We could see Kyiv
in the same situation as Homs

  
as the same situation as Aleppo

  
which would be catastrophic

  
and again would plant
terrible seeds of hatred

  
for years and decades

  
So far we've seen
hundreds of people being killed

  
Ukrainian citizens being killed

  
It could reach tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands

  
So in this sense it's extremely
painful to contemplate

  
And this is why we need again and again

  
to urge the leaders to stop this war

  
and especially again and again

  
tell Putin

  
"You will not be able
to absorb Ukraine into Russia

  
They don't want it they don't want you

  
If you continue

  
the only thing you will achieve
is to create terrible hatred

  
between Ukrainians and Russians
for generations

  
It doesn't have to be like that"

  
BG Yuval let me finish
with one question about your county

  
You are in Israel

  
Israel has close ties
with both Russia and Ukraine

  
It's actually home of many Russianborn
and many Ukrainianborn Jews

  
How is the country reacting
to this conflict

  
I'm talking about the government
but also about the population

  
YNH Actually I'm not
the best person to ask

  
I've been so kind of following
what's happening around the world

  
I didn't pay so much attention
to what is happening right here

  
And even though I live here

  
I'm not an expert on Israeli society
or Israeli politics

  
Definitely the sentiment in the street
in the social media is with Ukraine

  
You see Ukrainian flags

  
you see on social media
people putting Ukrainian flags

  
on their accounts

  
And another thing
so many people in Israel

  
they came from the former Soviet Union

  
And until now

  
everybody was simply known as Russians

  
You know even if you came from Azerbaijan
or you came from Bukhara

  
you were a Russian

  
And suddenly "No no no no no

  
I'm not Russian

  
I'm Ukrainian"

  
And again these seeds of hatred
that Putin is planting

  
it's reaching also here

  
That suddenly people are saying
no Russian Ukrainian

  
until a very short time ago
it's the same thing

  
No it's not the same thing

  
So the shock waves are spreading

  
BG Yuval thank you for taking the time
and being with us today

  
and sharing your knowledge
and your views on the situation

  
Thank you very much

  
YNH Thank you
and I hope for peace quickly

  
BG We all do Thank you

Bruno Giussani It's difficult
to think clearly

  
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine

  
because wars while they unfold

  
they're kind of shrouded in a sort of fog

  
Information is abundant

  
the millions of refugees

  
the shocking suffering
and the destruction the politics

  
But sense is lacking

  
And that's going to be the focus
of this Membership conversation

  
as we enter the third week of the war

  
We won’t talk about the events of the day

  
but try to project a longer arc
a broader context

  
Our guest is geopolitical
analyst Ian Bremmer

  
He's the founder
and president of Eurasia Group

  
and we asked him to lay the scene

  
by talking first
about the geopolitical shifts

  
that have already been brought
by the war in Ukraine

  
And after we're going to have
a conversation

  
including questions from TED Members
who are participating in this call

  
Ian welcome

  
Ian Bremmer Thank you very much

  
I'll start by saying that in my lifetime

  
the most important geopolitical artifact
is the fall of the Berlin Wall

  
I mean you see it

  
if you go into the new
NATO headquarters in Brussels

  
just built a few years ago

  
And anyone that has a piece
something they're very proud of

  
they know it affected their entire lives

  
I think that in  years' time

  
and I fear that in  years' time

  
if we look back

  
a second most important
geopolitical artifact

  
will be a piece of the rubble
of the Maidan in Kyiv

  
I believe that the war
that we are seeing right now

  
is no more and no less

  
than the end of the peace dividend

  
that we all thought we had

  
when the wall came down in 

  
The idea that the world could focus
more on globalization

  
and goods and services
and people and ideas

  
going faster and faster across borders

  
leading to unprecedented growth
in human development

  
and a global middle class

  
I think that this is a tipping point

  
Won't end globalization

  
but it does end the peace dividend

  
It does mean that the Europeans overnight

  
will and must prioritize
spending on defense policy

  
on national security
coordination on NATO

  
And the speech that was given
by Olaf Scholz

  
the new chancellor two weeks ago

  
in my view the most significant speech
given by a European leader

  
in the postCold War environment

  
precisely because it's now
the postpostCold War environment

  
sending weapons to the Ukrainians

  
committing to over two percent
of GDP spend on defense

  
investing in a new fund
for defense infrastructure

  
But also recognizing that the way

  
that the Germans
and the Europeans as a whole

  
looked at the world
and looked at themselves was

  
unfortunately for all of us outdated

  
A few other points I'd like to raise
just to kick off this conversation

  
One

  
One of the reasons
I'm pretty negative about this

  
and I'm not usually very negative
I'm usually an existential optimist

  
I’m someone that’s just happy
there’s water in the glass

  
But when I look at this conflict
I’m much more concerned

  
And that is because I do not
see a scenario

  
a plausible scenario
in the foreseeable future

  
where Putin emerges from this war

  
in anything less than a radically
weakened position

  
compared to where he was
before he announced the invasion

  
And I believe that both in terms
of his domestic political orientation

  
how stable he is in his own country

  
also of course
Russia's economic position

  
and finally Russia's position
in terms of global security

  
and European security

  
ostensibly the very reason that Putin
began the war to begin with

  
Second big point is that the decoupling
that we are seeing from Europe

  
and the United States with Russia
is in my view permanent

  
And that would be true even if there were
a negotiated settlement

  
and all the Russian troops
were to pull out of Ukraine

  
and we had peace

  
I still think that a lot
of those companies would not come back

  
with Putin in power

  
I'm convinced that the decisions
by the Europeans

  
to ramp up their national security
capabilities will be permanent

  
Permanent deployments coming
in the Baltic states for example

  
forward deployments in Poland
and Bulgaria and Romania

  
And also an unwind of Europe’s
massive energy dependence

  
coal oil and most importantly gas

  
on Russia

  
That does not make Russia a global pariah

  
because you can't be a global pariah

  
if the soontobe most important
economy in the world China

  
is actually your bestie
on the global stage

  
and that indeed continues to be true

  
despite China's efforts
to portray themselves

  
towards Europe at least

  
as more neutral

  
We are going to see the Russians
as a supplicant economically

  
in terms of energy flows

  
financially in terms of transactions

  
and technologically
perhaps most important

  
aligned with China

  
That has big geopolitical
implications longterm

  
Also a lot of other developing
economies like the Indians

  
like the Gulf states like Brazil

  
are also not going to work
with Russia as a pariah

  
They'll continue to engage

  
Are there any silver linings

  
And I think there are a few

  
Of course there is a much greater
renewed purpose and mission of NATO

  
I mean this is an organization
that just a couple of years ago

  
France President Emmanuel Macron
referred to as “braindead”

  
It was increasingly drifting
in terms of its importance

  
The Americans were focusing
much more on Asia the pivot

  
Not today

  
Today NATO is purposeful

  
it's aligned it's consolidated

  
it's going to get more
resources not less

  
That's also true of the European
Union as a whole

  
even when we talk about countries
like Hungary and Poland

  
that have been much less aligned
in terms of rule of law

  
in terms of an independent judiciary

  
much more aligned in terms
of the importance

  
of common values of Europe

  
compared to that of what
we're seeing in Moscow

  
I mentioned the German security
and policy shift

  
The UKEU relationship is much
smoother and more functional

  
than at any point since Brexit
process actually started

  
And even the United States

  
I mean if you watched
the State of the Union

  
for a brief moment in time
five or  minutes

  
when all of the Democrats and Republicans
were standing and applauding together

  
you could be forgiven for believing
that the United States

  
had a functional representative democracy

  
Now I'm not sure how long
this is going to last

  
but at least as of now

  
leaders of the Democratic
and Republican Party

  
see Putin as much more
of a threat an enemy

  
than they do their opponents
across the aisle in domestic politics

  
And two weeks ago that was not true

  
That's significant

  
Final silver lining
and I wish it was more of one

  
but the Chinese

  
as much as they are strategically
aligned with Russia

  
and with the person of President Putin

  
they do not want a second Cold War

  
And they would rather
a negotiated settlement

  
They're not willing to push
very hard for it

  
But they certainly do not see
a radical decoupling of the Russian

  
and potentially the Chinese economy

  
from the rest of the world from Europe

  
from the US from the advanced
industrial democracies

  
as in any way in their interest

  
And ultimately that does create
at least some buffer

  
some guardrail on how much this is likely
to escalate as a conflict going forward

  
BG I want to make a step back
and unpack some of that

  
maybe starting with a question
that relates to your last point

  
and is probably on the mind of many

  
And it is

  
Is there still some real
space for negotiation

  
Is there still a potential relationship
between Russia and Ukraine

  
IB The foreign ministers of Russia
and Ukraine just met recently in Turkey

  
It was as much of a nonevent

  
as the three preceding negotiations
of more junior representatives

  
of their teams on the Belarus border

  
The one thing that has been
accomplished to a small degree

  
has been humanitarian corridors

  
extending out of a number
of Ukrainian cities

  
that are being pounded
by Russian military

  
That's because the Ukrainians are
interested in protecting their civilians

  
and the Russians are interested
in taking a lot of territory

  
without necessarily having to kill
so many Ukrainians

  
that could cause problems
for them internationally

  
as well as domestically inside Russia

  
But that is nowhere close
to a negotiated settlement

  
Now I mean everyone I know

  
that's involved
in the negotiations right now

  
responds that the President Putin himself
is hellbent on taking Kyiv

  
and on removing Zelenskyy from power

  
Now I think and by the way
they're getting quite close

  
to being able to accomplish that
militarily on the ground

  
I think within the next couple of weeks
certainly it looks very likely

  
A couple of points here

  
One there is no reason to put
any stock in anything

  
that the Russians are saying publicly
in terms of their diplomacy

  
They lied to the face
of every world leader

  
about the invasion that they said
they were not going to do into Ukraine

  
And then just today

  
Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov publicly said

  
well the Russians didn't attack Ukraine

  
I mean this is Orwellian stuff right

  
So first of all do not report
on Russian public statements

  
as if they bear any semblance
to reality on the ground

  
Secondarily this looks like a huge
loss for Putin right now

  
He understands it and I think
he would have a hard time

  
even with his control of information
spinning this to his public

  
without removing Zelenskyy

  
without the “deNazification”
as he calls it 

  
which is an obscenity in an environment

  
where the Ukrainian president
is actually Jewish 

  
the disarmament of Ukraine

  
and of course the ability of the Russians

  
to change how they feel about Ukraine
as a threat to the Russian homeland

  
BG What level of support
can we give Ukraine militarily

  
intel economic

  
before Putin considers
taking a strike on a NATO country

  
IB Well it’s interesting the way
you framed that Bruno

  
Because I mean

  
I think that Putin is already considering
strikes on NATO countries

  
I mean there were massive attacks

  
cyberattacks and disinformation attacks

  
by Russia against NATO countries
with reckless abandon

  
over the course of the past years

  
And in fact when President Biden
met with Putin in Geneva back in June

  
it seems like years
and years ago at this point

  
Biden set the agenda

  
Ukraine was largely not discussed

  
but what was discussed was cyberattacks
on critical infrastructure

  
Because you may remember Bruno

  
that meeting came right after
the cyber attacks

  
against the Colonial Pipeline

  
And the Russians after that
indeed pulled back

  
on supporting those attacks
by their criminal cyber syndicates

  
I expect those attacks to restart
in very short order

  
against NATO countries

  
I also believe that the fact that the West
is sending weapons to Ukraine

  
and is providing realtime
intelligence reports

  
on the disposition of Russian troops
on the ground in Ukraine

  
to better allow the Ukrainians
to defend themselves

  
and blow the Russians up

  
that is considered by the Russians
to be an act of war

  
and they will retaliate

  
And how they retaliate is the question

  
I don't think they're going to send
troops into Poland

  
But you know

  
when the Americans under Reagan
were providing that kind of support

  
to the mujahideen

  
to help them defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan

  
the Soviets saw that as an act of war

  
and they engaged in acts of terrorism
against the mujahideen in Pakistan

  
And I absolutely think
that that is on the table

  
in terms of front line
NATO countries especially

  
like Poland like the Baltic states
like Bulgaria Romania

  
Would that be considered
an Article V attack

  
Would that force NATO countries
to strike the Russians back

  
I'm not sure it would

  
Not directly not militarily

  
So I mean I do think that the fact
that the NATO countries see

  
there is some sort of a big red line
between sending troops in for example

  
and doing a nofly zone
because that could cause World War III

  
but everything short of that
is just a proxy war

  
The Russians don't see it that way

  
And that gives the Russians
some advantage tactically

  
in terms of their willingness to escalate

  
BG You're describing a spiral
of escalation here

  
that will touch the globe
and not only Ukraine

  
not only the eastern flank of Europe

  
which means that not only this war
has ripple effects everywhere

  
but this is also starting
a sort of realignment

  
of the global geopolitical
situation and context

  
To me it has been very striking
how Europe and the US

  
have kind of moved very fast
in a cohesive way

  
And it has chosen after years
of prioritizing the economics

  
in their international
and global dealings

  
it's chosen to put politics over markets

  
It has adopted sanctions
that will hurt Russia

  
but will also hurt Western businesses

  
It’s the discussion about decoupling
that you put forward before

  
an active kind of fencing out
of the Russian economy

  
Talk to us about how do you see
this decoupling playing out

  
IB Yeah I mean I do think
that for the Europeans

  
this is a permanent move

  
I mean I've spoken to top leaders
in the German government

  
who tell me that Nord Stream
was a strategic mistake

  
and they understand it

  
Who say that you know

  
Scholz making this speech
from the Social Democratic Party

  
on the center left

  
is the equivalent of Nixon going to China

  
No one else could have made that move

  
But having made it everyone is on board

  
The popularity in Germany

  
even given the massive
economic consequences

  
is extraordinary and is across the board

  
And what they need to do now

  
is ensure that the diversification
of fossil fuels in the near term

  
away from Russia

  
towards Qatar and Azerbaijan
and even you know

  
sort of the United States for LNG

  
can be done as fast as humanly possible

  
And that further even though
it’s going to cost a lot

  
some of it will be uneconomic

  
the move towards renewables
actually picks up and is faster

  
The Italians Mario Draghi

  
I think his shift in strategic
orientation that they will do

  
this is his "whatever it takes" moment

  
He had that in response
to the  financial crisis

  
as the head of the European Central Bank

  
and that made him “Super Mario”

  
This is making him Super Mario
as the Italian prime minister

  
This is the "whatever it takes"
moment for the Italians

  
who never make public statements
that undermine their economic

  
their commercial interests
like this in such a strategic way

  
The French of course
have less to be concerned about

  
in the sense that most of their energy
comes from nuclear power and is domestic

  
So they are not as affected directly
by a cutoff from Russia

  
And also because Macron fancies himself

  
especially as the leader
of the European Commission this year

  
the rotating leadership
occupying the presidency

  
but also with his elections coming up

  
and just given his personal belief
that he can drive diplomacy

  
I believe that even after Kyiv falls

  
and after Zelenskyy
is either killed or forced out

  
that the Americans will not want
to engage in direct diplomacy

  
the Germans probably won't

  
The French will

  
And by the way the Chinese will too

  
And I do believe
that there is a potential

  
and this is a danger
for the cohesiveness of the West

  
that the Chinese and Macron end up being
the postKyiv Normandy format

  
of diplomacy

  
That's something that the Americans
and the Germans right now

  
are starting to worry about quite a bit

  
Now that's the European shift

  
And I think as I said
I think it's permanent

  
I believe the UK is in that camp as well

  
I'm not so sure the United States
is going to be as committed

  
for as long a term

  
It doesn't affect the Americans
as much economically

  
it doesn't affect the Americans as much
in terms of a direct security issue

  
None of those refugees are coming
to the United States

  
But also American inequality

  
American political polarization
and dysfunction is so much greater

  
than what you experience
on the continent in Europe

  
So the potential that in six months' time
or in two years' time

  
as we're thinking about the  election

  
that the Americans have largely forgotten
about this Russia issue instead

  
are focusing once again
on domestic political opponents

  
as principal adversaries

  
which deeply undermines NATO

  
much more than anything
that would come from the Europeans

  
I think that is a real
open question going forward

  
that is perhaps as significant
as the question of where the Chinese go

  
BG Let me pick up on the point
you made about energy

  
because somehow Putin's calculus
can really change

  
if Russian oil and gas
stops flowing to Europe

  
if it becomes part
of the sanctions right

  
And this war indeed can kind of be read

  
as a war about energy

  
Selling energy funds it for Russia

  
being dependent on Russian energy makes
the European response more constrained

  
Rising energy insecurity
rising energy cost

  
may or probably will destabilize
European politics and economy

  
in the coming months

  
How would you look at this
from the perspective of energy

  
and is there any likelihood

  
that Russian oil and gas
is going to stop flowing

  
either because Putin cuts it
or the Europeans sanction it

  
IB Yeah or because it's blown up
in some of the transit in Ukraine

  
I mean keep in mind

  
so much of the gas transit
is going through large pipeline networks

  
which have some redundancy
across all of Ukraine

  
But there's a big war
that's going on right there

  
and lots of people that could have
incentive to create problems

  
The Americans of course the Canadians

  
have said that they're cutting off
oil import from Russia

  
but those are nominal numbers

  
so they don't matter very
much to the markets

  
The Europeans as I said

  
want to decouple themselves
as quickly as possible

  
but they believe that doing that this year
would be economic suicide

  
So there isn't despite everything
we see from Russia

  
they're using thermobaric weapons now
against the Ukrainian people

  
the Americans are warning

  
that they could use chemical
biological weapons against Ukraine

  
I mean you know
you even have some people saying

  
what if they use
a tactical nuclear weapon

  
I mean 

  
God willing none of these
things come to pass

  
But it is very hard to see
a military scenario in Ukraine

  
that leads the Europeans

  
to completely cut off their inbound gas
from Russia this year

  
It's very hard to see

  
And also I would say it's very hard
to see any level of economic sanction

  
that would change the mind of the Russians

  
in terms of their military decision making

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now I think there are a lot of things
that the West is doing

  
in terms of providing weapons
for the Ukrainians

  
that are having an impact on the ground

  
A lot more Russians are getting killed

  
It won’t prevent them
from taking to Kyiv again in my mind

  
I feel quite confident about that

  
But it's quite possible
perhaps even likely

  
that the west of Ukraine
will remain in Ukrainian hands

  
which means that you know
after this fighting is "over"

  
that a rump Ukrainian state in exile
exists in the West run by Zelenskyy

  
or someone that's aligned with him

  
and that they continue to get
enormous economic and military support

  
from all of the NATO countries

  
So even though I don't think

  
that the energy situation
will become so parlous

  
that it would affect
Putin's decision making

  
I do think that the West's response
does matter on the ground

  
BG The war is kind of having radiating
economic shock waves around the world now

  
ripple effects on food markets
for example and food security

  
We talk a lot about energy security

  
what about food security

  
IB Well you have the largest
grain producer in the world

  
invading the fifth largest
grain producer in the world

  
on the back of a twoyear pandemic
that's still ongoing

  
We don't talk about it much anymore
but it's still there

  
And of course this hit the poorest
countries in the world the hardest

  
The level of indebtedness

  
and the unsustainability
of paying that debt off

  
was already becoming a massive problem

  
for so many of the developing
countries in the world

  
And the IMF provided a lot of relief
in special drawing rights and direct aid

  
over the course of the past  months

  
but that money is now running to an end

  
And what happens
when commodity prices spike up

  
and we have severe supply chain challenges
with energy and food

  
and those things
are obviously very related

  
What happens is that a lot of people die

  
What happens is we see
a lot more starvation

  
The World Food Organization says about 
million people a year die of starvation

  
That number in the next  months
is going to be a lot higher

  
than it otherwise would have been

  
The number of people
who are food stressed in the world

  
is going to go way up
in subSaharan Africa in Yemen

  
in Afghanistan in Bangladesh

  
It's going to go way up

  
And you know
it's horrible to think about

  
but the massive impact
of this Russia crisis

  
is going to be much more
global inequality

  
And this is of course

  
a direct consequence of the end
of the peace dividend more structurally

  
That over the last  years
of globalization

  
what did you have

  
A lot of people were left behind

  
but the biggest thing you had

  
was the explosion of a single
global middle class

  
On the back of the pandemic

  
and now this RussiaUkraine war

  
and the decoupling of the Russian
economy from the West

  
which doesn't matter so much in terms
of the size of the Russian economy

  
but it matters immensely in terms
of commodities globally and supply chain

  
those two things are going
to seriously unwind

  
the growth of this global middle class

  
and they're going to stress developing
countries to a much greater degree

  
They will lead to financial crises
in countries like Turkey for example

  
that will no longer be able
to service their debt

  
You'll see more Lebanons out there

  
You'll see some in Latin America
you'll see some in subSaharan Africa

  
Those are the knockon effects and so

  
so many people that have been saying
over the last few weeks

  
"Why are we paying so much
attention to Ukraine

  
It's because they're white people
because they're European

  
We wouldn't pay that much attention
if they were Afghans

  
or if they were you know Afghanis
or if they were Yemenis

  
We wouldn't"

  
I mean first of all you've got millions
and millions of Ukrainian refugees

  
and we're not paying
as much attention to them

  
as we did to the Syrian refugees
precisely because of race

  
precisely because the Europeans
are more willing to integrate

  
millions and millions
of "fellow Europeans" into Europe

  
But we are paying much more attention
to the Ukraine crisis and we should

  
because the impact on the poorest
people around the world

  
is vastly greater

  
from this conflict
than anything that we've seen

  
in any of those smaller economies
with less impact

  
despite all of the human depredation
that’s happened over the past  years

  
BG Ian I want to talk
for a second about climate

  
because another crisis that has kind of
disappeared from the headlines

  
is the climate crisis right

  
Ten days ago the IPCC released a report

  
that the secretary general
of the UN described

  
as an "atlas of human suffering"

  
if I remember correctly

  
And it has been basically ignored

  
Over the last several years

  
much of the world had started to embark
with more or less enthusiasm

  
on a process of transitioning
away from oil and gas

  
and into kind of a clean energy future

  
And now the war comes in

  
and we look at what you just described
the unraveling of global supply chains

  
the dependency on energy and so on

  
And there are kind of two
schools of thought here

  
One says this war is going to accelerate
the adoption of clean energy

  
because we need to diminish dependence
from Russia and these fossil fuels

  
And the other says
the other school of thought says

  
it's going to derail
the transition to clean energy

  
because suddenly the priority
is no longer decarbonization

  
suddenly the priority
is energy security energy supply

  
IB The Europeans
are largely in the first camp

  
and they will move towards faster
decoupling and investment accordingly

  
The Americans are largely
in the second camp

  
and they will move towards

  
"Let's focus more on fossil fuels
and partisan divide on this issue"

  
accordingly

  
The Chinese

  
who are the largest carbon emitter
in the world by a long margin

  
though not per capita
and not historically

  
but still in terms of every year totals

  
they will continue on the same
path they've been on

  
which is a netzero target

  
but without yet a very strong plan
on how to get there

  
and not feeling a lot of pressure
to provide that plan

  
because they think the Americans
are completely incoherent

  
and incapable of effectuating
a strategic longterm plan

  
on climate themselves

  
So I mean what we have is a lot
of progress on climate and of course

  
technology around renewable energies
and around electric batteries

  
and supply chain

  
continue to get cheaper and cheaper

  
as more money is being invested in it

  
And that does make me longterm
more optimistic that by 

  
a majority of the world's energy
will probably be coming from renewables

  
And five years ago
I wouldn't have said that

  
But still I mean when the news today

  
is that the Americans are sending
a highlevel delegation to Caracas

  
to figure out if we can reopen
relations with Venezuela

  
to get them to produce more oil again

  
With the Iranians

  
let's do any deal possible to get back
into the JCPOA the nuclear deal

  
so that we can get that oil on the market

  
Calling the Saudis calling the Emiratis

  
and they’re not willing to take
Biden’s phone call on this issue

  
while they're talking to Putin

  
Those are warning signals
that in the near term

  
we've got some big challenges

  
and a lot of those challenges are going
to be filled with fossil fuels

  
and fossil fuel development

  
And so I do think that the fact

  
that both of the answers to your question
are true in different places

  
on netnet is more negative
for how quickly we can transition

  
BG Let's talk a bit about China

  
Brigid I think
who’s listening in asks

  
"What do you believe
Xi Jinping is learning

  
from the world's response
to the crisis to the Ukrainian war"

  
IB Well certainly learning that this
was a red line for the West

  
And I think that this
would have surprised

  
it obviously surprised Putin

  
I think it would have surprised
Xi Jinping as well

  
Xi Jinping saw Afghanistan

  
He saw that Merkel was out

  
He saw that Macron is focused
on strategic autonomy

  
He sees Biden as much more focused
on China and Asia

  
I think that this
is a surprise to Xi Jinping

  
But Xi Jinping also sees

  
that a lot of the world
is not with NATO on this issue

  
 countries if I remember correctly

  
voted to censor the Russians
for their invasion of Ukraine

  
at the United Nations General Assembly

  
But very large numbers of that 

  
are not on board with all
of these sanctions against Russia

  
They're happy with the diplomatic censure

  
but they need to continue
to work with the Russians

  
The Chinese see that too

  
The Chinese see just how much more
fragmented the global order is

  
I thought the most significant thing
that we've seen from the Chinese so far

  
two issues

  
The first is of course
when Putin went to Beijing

  
and Xi Jinping made
the public announcement

  
that “this is our best friend
on the global stage

  
and we will work much more strategically
with them economically

  
diplomatically and militarily
going forward"

  
And Xi Jinping knew very well
where Ukraine was heading at that point

  
and also knew that the likelihood
of an invasion was coming

  
Didn't stop him from making
that announcement in the slightest

  
And then after the invasion
and it's going badly

  
I mean if you watch Chinese social media

  
the fact is that the censorship
is all about Ukraine

  
I mean the Chinese media space

  
is pursuing a relentlessly
proPutin policy

  
They have media embedded
with Russian troops

  
on the ground in Ukraine

  
Now publicly the Chinese
government wants to be seen

  
as “We’re neutral we like the Russians

  
we like the Ukrainians

  
we still want to work with everybody"

  
But the fact is that China
feels no problem

  
being publicly completely
aligned with Putin

  
despite the fact that they are invading
a democratic government

  
with  million people
in the middle of Europe

  
That's a pretty astonishing
statement from the Chinese

  
And there's no question
that they have learned

  
that they're in a vastly better
economic position than they used to be

  
and that gives them influence

  
They are a government
who projects its power

  
primarily through economic
and technological means

  
as opposed to Russia that projects it
primarily through military means

  
And the Chinese believe

  
that there is a level of decoupling
that is already going on

  
as the Americans focus
on more industrial policy

  
as they focus on America first
for American workers

  
A US foreign policy for the American
middle class as Biden put it

  
is one that really pushes a lot of capital
to leave a country like China

  
which had served
as the factory for the world

  
but at the expense of a lot of labor

  
coming out of advanced
industrial economies

  
And now yes there are
definitely some dangers

  
that come from the Chinese being perceived
as too close to Russia

  
and they won't want that

  
and they'll want to make sure
that they're engaging diplomatically

  
with the Europeans
to try to minimize that damage

  
But I thought it was very interesting

  
and I'm not sure this is public yet

  
that the Chinese ambassador to Russia
recently in the last few days

  
organized a meeting of a lot
of the top investors

  
Chinese investors in Russia saying

  
"This is a unique opportunity
the West is leaving

  
we should be going in and doing more

  
Because they're going to be completely
reliant on us going forward"

  
That is not a message
that the Chinese ambassador delivers

  
unless he is told
directly to from Beijing

  
BG Ian I'm going to jump
from topic to topic

  
because there are several
questions in the chat

  
Nancy is asking about whether Putin
can be removed from power

  
There's been a lot of discussion lately
about regime change in Russia

  
either endogenous like a palace coup

  
or provoked by sanctions
and other policies

  
And so she asks

  
"How likely is that Putin will face
a challenge from inside Russia

  
whether a popular uprising
a coup or other"

  
IB It's very very unlikely
until it happens

  
(Chuckles)

  
I mean in the sense
that there is absolutely no purpose

  
in trying to say oh I mean you know

  
there are rumors that Defense Minister
Shoigu is unhappy and you know

  
he might be making a move

  
And I’ve seen these
from relatively credible analysts

  
I'm like no no
if there are such rumors

  
then we know it's not happening

  
because that's the end
of Shoigu and his family

  
But it's very clear that there is more
pressure on Putin now

  
than at any point
since he's been president

  
Domestic pressure on Putin

  
About  Russians
have been arrested so far detained

  
most of them have been released

  
for nonviolent antiwar protests

  
The Russians have shut down
all the Western media

  
They've shut down all the Russian
opposition and independent media

  
So Putin has control of the space

  
though if you look at Russian
conversations on Telegram

  
you'll still see a bunch of people
that are seriously seriously antiwar

  
But you know once the economy
starts truly imploding

  
and you can't find goods on shelves
in Russia in major cities

  
and this is coming you know very soon
this is a matter of days

  
in many of these cities

  
those demonstrations
will likely become greater

  
some of them can become violent

  
You know that'll increase the pressure

  
Then you have the issue of how
the Russians are fighting on the ground

  
I mean what happens
if you get a lot of desertions

  
We haven't seen that so far

  
What happens if you get
orders to bomb Kyiv

  
and a whole bunch of Russian
fighter pilots bomber pilots

  
decide not to and they defect
to Poland to Germany

  
That would have a big impact on morale

  
That has not happened so far

  
I mean do be aware of the fact

  
that the Ukrainians are winning
the war on information

  
and that means that the information
that you are getting in the West

  
about the war

  
is much more proUkrainian 

  
morale enthusiasm

  
how well the military is doing 

  
than what's actually
happening on the ground

  
And also be aware of the fact

  
that the Russians completely control
the war on information inside Russia

  
BG Exactly

  
IB They're not getting a balanced view

  
They're getting a completely
proPutin view

  
And most of them actually believe it

  
in the same way that most people
that voted for Trump in the US

  
believe that the election was stolen
and Trump is still president

  
I mean it's much worse
in Russia in that regard

  
than it is in the United States

  
and I think that that's
underappreciated in the West

  
So even though I think there's pressure

  
I really don't think
that it's super likely

  
that Putin is out anytime imminently

  
BG Ed is asking whether you see
any offramp for Putin

  
IB I think that the most likely offramp
for Putin is after Kyiv is taken

  
and Zelenskyy is removed
one way or the other

  
at that point

  
the possibility of the Russians
accepting a frozen conflict

  
or a cease fire that could lead
to ongoing negotiations

  
is a lot higher

  
because Putin can sell that as a win
back home much more easily

  
But also because further
Russian attacks at that point

  
serve much less purpose for the Russians

  
are much harder to bring about

  
and potentially have much more
negative consequences

  
So for me that would be
the nearterm potential break

  
where we could at least freeze issues
largely where they are

  
Now whether that could then eventually
lead to a climbdown or not

  
I mean the Russians have been very happy
with frozen conflicts on their borders

  
for years and years and years

  
I'm thinking about NagornoKarabakh
between Armenia and Azerbaijan

  
which basically stayed in place
until the Azeris

  
over the course of a decade
got enough military capacity

  
that they could forcibly change
the situation on the ground

  
Which by the way the Ukrainians might
also be eventually thinking about

  
because the West will be supplying them
with advanced weapons all the way through

  
I'm thinking South Ossetia in Georgia

  
I'm also of course thinking
about the two pieces of Ukraine

  
they took back in 

  
So be aware of the fact that a negotiation
that creates a cease fire

  
does not mean you're anywhere
close to a resolution

  
or an end of the fighting
that we're seeing

  
BG Someone else in the chat
who didn't sign by his or her name

  
is asking about the nuclear fear
that hangs over the conflict

  
How should we think of that

  
IB Yeah we don't like it
when Putin uses the Nword

  
and there's no question

  
I mean he and his direct reports
have rattled nuclear sabers

  
on at least five times
that I've seen in the past few weeks

  
I think that 

  
In  I wasn't alive
we had the Cuban Missile Crisis

  
There was a real possibility
of nuclear confrontation

  
between the world's two superpowers

  
At least for the last  years
there’s been no chance of that

  
Functionally no chance of that

  
I think we're now back in a world

  
where a Cuban Missile Crisis
is again a reality

  
Now that doesn't mean that I think
nuclear war is likely or imminent

  
I don't

  
And in fact

  
there is active deconfliction
going on even today

  
the Americans and Russians
with a new hotline

  
the secretary general of the UN

  
with the Russian defense minister

  
engaging in deconfliction
measures with UN

  
offices being invited to Moscow

  
So as bad as it is right now

  
people that have been
doing this for a long time

  
are trying to avoid nuclear war

  
But that's the point

  
Is we're now in a situation

  
where the conflict
that we're going to experience

  
needs to be actively managed

  
because of the danger
of nuclear confrontation

  
So it now becomes a risk on the horizon
that we must be continually aware of

  
even if only at a low level

  
as we take and consider further actions

  
as we consider diplomacy

  
as we consider escalation

  
It is now on the table in a way
that frankly is so debilitating

  
I mean as human beings all on this call

  
one of the most painful
things to think about

  
is the fact that we still have
these  nuclear warheads in Russia

  
and  the United States
that are still pointed at each other

  
and they still have the potential
to destroy the planet

  
And we haven't had any real
lessons that we've been able to learn

  
institutionally from 

  
BG  being a generic figure
not the exact figure

  
but we are kind of
in that order of magnitude

  
Then of course there is the question
of civilian nuclear

  
so the two power plants
nuclear power plants

  
that have been seized by the Russians

  
One has been slightly damaged by a bomb

  
the other has been turned off

  
But those are also potentially gigantic
nuclear problems just waiting to happen

  
IB Chemical weapons biological weapons

  
I mean look we have had two million
refugees from Ukraine in two weeks

  
As this continues you're looking
at five to  million refugees

  
I mean it is hard 

  
Just take a step for a moment
just as a human being

  
Imagine what it would take for a quarter
of your country's population

  
to say “I am not living here anymore

  
I am leaving everything
because of the condition of the country

  
because of this unjust war

  
that has been imposed upon you
by your neighbor"

  
That's what we're looking at

  
And again it's important
for us to you know

  
not lose the humanity of this crisis

  
and the extraordinary hardship

  
that is being visited
upon  million Ukrainians

  
that have done nothing wrong
they have committed no sin

  
other than their desire to have
an independent country

  
BG One other country

  
that has not yet taken
a very clear position is India

  
IB Well they're a member of the Quad

  
and their relationship with China
is pretty bad and that’s mutual

  
But in terms of Russia

  
there's been a longstanding relationship

  
trade relationship defense relationship

  
between India and Russia

  
that the Russians
are not going to jettison

  
and they see no reason to jettison it

  
And as long as you've got a whole bunch
of other countries out there

  
that are substantial
that are willing to say

  
we're going to keep playing ball
with the Russians

  
then the Indians will too

  
And that's why you've got the abstention
in the United Nations vote

  
And that's why you've had
very careful comments

  
as opposed to overt
and strong condemnation

  
coming from the Indian leadership

  
BG Phil in the chat is asking

  
"Will this cause a fragmentation
of the financial system

  
with kind of a Western system
and an Eastern system”

  
So two different SWIFTlike systems
two different credit card systems

  
crypto what's the role
of crypto in all this

  
IB I hope not

  
I mean I will tell you
that before the invasion started

  
if you talk to most Western CEOs

  
and I'm talking across
the entire sweep of sectors

  
so it's finance and it's manufacturing
and its services and it's tech

  
most of them would have told you
that they did not in any way plan

  
on reducing their footprint in China

  
and a lot of them said

  
that China was their most important
growth market in the world

  
Not a surprise

  
China is going to be the largest
economy in the world in 

  
So you know a world
that you're decoupling

  
is not a good world

  
when China is going to be
number one economically

  
I mean that obviously
is going to hurt the West in a big way

  
So there are strong
incentives against that

  
and there remain very strong
and powerful entrenched interests

  
in the United States and Europe
that will resist direct decoupling

  
Despite the fact that there are
these more incremental moves

  
towards friendsourcing and insourcing

  
because you know
Chinese labor is more expensive

  
you don’t need as much labor
to get capital moving

  
given robotics

  
and big data deep learning
all of those things

  
But I do think that the Russia conflict

  
risks a level of secondorder decoupling

  
Because if the Russians end up
financially integrated with China

  
in their own

  
notaseffective SWIFT system

  
and all of their energy
ends up going to China

  
and the Chinese build that infrastructure
and they get a discount on it

  
and Russia's technology and their military
industrial complex gets serviced

  
by Chinese semiconductors
and Chinese componentry

  
well I do think that there will be
knockon decoupling

  
that will be longer term
and more strategic

  
from the United States from the Europeans

  
and even from Japan and South Korea

  
So that is a worry

  
and I think the Chinese
are highly aware of that

  
And over the coming months
they will do everything they can

  
both with the Europeans in particular

  
but also I expect at least
with some of the Asian economies

  
to try to limit the impact of that

  
Now keep in mind

  
we haven't talked at all
about Asia yet outside of China

  
The new Japanese Prime Minister Kishida
is at least as hawkish

  
in his orientation towards
China and Russia as Abe was

  
He is providing support
for the Ukrainians

  
including some military capacity 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
He's allowing Ukrainian refugees 

  
unheard of for the Japanese

  
And yesterday the South Koreans
had a very very tight election

  
and Yoon is now in charge

  
He is on the right and he is the guy
that is strongly antiChina

  
was talking about South Korea
having nuclear capabilities

  
wants a new THAAD missile
defense system for the South Koreans

  
and wants to rebuild
the relationship with Tokyo

  
That matters

  
And that's a big strategic change
in the geopolitical map

  
that will look more problematic
on the decoupling front

  
from Beijing's perspective

  
BG Three final quick questions
that all come from the chat Ian

  
One is because you mentioned
the rest of Asia outside of China

  
"What about the rest of the world

  
What about Africa and Latin America

  
How do they factor into this
conversation or don't they"

  
IB They factor in

  
I mean those that have
significant commodities do well

  
because the prices
are going to be so high

  
Those that don't are going to be
under massive pressure

  
for reasons we already talked about

  
but they are not going to be forced
to pick a side on this one

  
I just don't see it

  
In the same way that if you were Colombia
in the last couple of years

  
you know you found

  
even though you're working very closely
with an American ally

  
you're still dealing with Huawei and G

  
This is knockon effects of all of this

  
These are countries
that are not going to take on

  
significant economic burden

  
given how much they're suffering
right now geopolitically

  
BG Another one is about sanctions

  
How do we even know when and how

  
at what point we start
rolling back sanctions

  
IB I think that as long
as Ukraine is occupied

  
by the Russian government

  
for the foreseeable future
and Putin is there

  
I can't see these sanctions
getting unwound

  
Now if a rump Ukrainian government
that is democratically elected

  
were prepared to sue for peace
and retakes most of Ukraine

  
but they give away Crimea
and they give away the Donbass

  
could you see in that environment
some of these sanctions unwound

  
Sure

  
But I mean I am suggesting

  
that I think that many of these sanctions
are functionally permanent

  
They reflect a new way of doing business

  
And when people ask me
what’s going to happen when this is over

  
my response is what do you mean over

  
What's over is the peace dividend

  
We are now in a new environment

  
BG And one of the figures
of this new environment

  
and I want to close with that
is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine

  
who was not taken very seriously
when he was elected

  
he has come out as a significant
figure in this war

  
What do you make of President Zelenskyy

  
How do you read this character

  
IB He's very courageous

  
I'm obviously inspired by his ability
to communicate and rally his people

  
and take personal risk in Kyiv
while this invasion is going on

  
But I'm very conflicted

  
because I think many of the steps
that Zelenskyy took

  
in the runup to this conflict

  
actually made the likelihood
of conflict worse

  
He was unwilling to take the advice
of the Americans and Europeans seriously

  
in the months leading up to the conflict

  
He was unwilling to mobilize his people

  
to ready them for
the potential of conflict

  
He was certainly unwilling to give an inch

  
in terms of Ukraine's desire
to be a member of NATO

  
even though he knew completely

  
that no one in NATO was prepared
to offer a membership action plan

  
let alone actually
bring them in as members

  
And part of that is a lack of experience

  
and lack of any business
being in that position

  
in the runup to this crisis

  
So I’m very deeply conflicted
in my personal views on Zelenskyy

  
given the way he behaved
before the invasion

  
compared to the extraordinary leadership
that he has displayed to all of us

  
over the last two weeks

  
BG Ian thank you for taking the time

  
for sharing your knowledge
and your analysis with us

  
We deeply appreciate it
Thank you very much

  
IB Good to see all of you

“Turn the tides

  
We must give back”

  
chant my ancestors

  
The thunder strikes 

  
(Hands clap)

  
as the sea demoness 
swept through the lands

  
with a fiery likeness of Letao’s fire

  
Tearing apart livelihood

  
the mounting waves and erosions
leave my island gaping

  
like the mouth of a dead fish

  
Tense muscles of uncles and aunties

  
that hauled cement for the seawall

  
cooked meals for the hungry bellies

  
Release in relief

  
The tides have gone out

  
I look to my grandparents’ graves

  
intimate with limp seaweeds

  
The disrespect

  
(Marshallese) Iakwe nan aolep

  
My name is Selina Leem

  
At  at the COP 

  
alongside late ambassador
for climate change Tony de Brum

  
I introduced myself
as a small island girl with big dreams

  
Five years later I reintroduced myself

  
as a climate warrior from Aelon Kein Ad

  
the Marshall Islands

  
Situated between Hawaii and Australia

  
our chain of islands decorate
the Pacific Ocean like seashells

  
and they are home to about  people

  
Our islands average about
two meters above sea level

  
and it is not uncommon to see
both the ocean and lagoon side

  
from wherever you stand

  
We say our highest point

  
is the bridge which curves
about seven meters above the sea

  
The massive body of water
is our reality and our livelihood

  
With a history of seafaring

  
the ocean connected our islands together

  
as well as providing
many resources to fish

  
to feed

  
and to adorn our handicrafts
with seashells that we make a living from

  
But the climate crisis has brought
calamities to my people

  
threatening our very livelihoods

  
In the Pacific king tide season
is from November to April

  
This is when the tides
are at their highest

  
and each year the sea level rises

  
In these months especially houses
by the seashore end up flooded

  
or damaged completely

  
Schools and churches have had to open
their doors for community members

  
to come sleep at

  
when announcements come in the radio
advising to find shelter

  
because of incoming tides

  
And we huddled together
with our blankets and pillows

  
no matter that we are strangers
as we sleep next to one another

  
Seawalls are rebuilt
as soon as it’s low tide

  
only to be broken down again

  
by the waves that grow higher each year

  
And these waves

  
their path continues on into the islands

  
bringing with it garbage
we’ve thrown into it

  
You see the graves of your loved ones
submerged in water

  
littered

  
Then the vegetation starts to brown;

  
it is dying

  
The soil becomes salinated

  
You pray the bigger trees hold on

  
for their roots are needed
to prevent further erosion

  
In the most effected parts of the lands

  
the land has regressed

  
coming closer and closer
to the road each year

  
Our driest part of the year happens
within this time period too

  
We are unable to use groundwater well
because it becomes saltier as well

  
In the capital Majuro once per week

  
water is dispensed

  
and my neighbors and I fill up our tanks

  
our water catchments

  
our bottles and our buckets

  
Our government has had to declare
a state of national emergency

  
calling for help from our friends

  
Sealevel rising

  
flooding

  
droughts

  
erosion have been the reality
of my people for many many many years

  
We’ve been told to move

  
To become climate change refugees

  
I’m not even sure
who would even take us in

  
But to those who think
that we can just accept our fate

  
I want to say

  
Adaptation and Indigenous knowledge 
are the solutions

  
These islands are our ancestors

  
our predecessors

  
our homes

  
We are at the risk of losing all of that

  
for something we contributed
very very little to

  
Raising and expanding the islands
is something my country is thinking of

  
However we don’t have the resources
nor the infrastructure

  
Regardless

  
we remain adamant

  
We continue to fight for our livelihoods

  
and not abandon our home

  
Thank you

It’s the morning of June th 

  
and a pigeon named Paddy is making
an epic  kilometer journey

  
He manages to dodge Nazi falcons
then beats on through stormy weather

  
flying an average of  kilometers
per hour for almost five hours straight

  
Paddy’s carrying the first news 
of the DDay invasion back to England

  
He wins a medal for gallantry
for this accomplishment

  
Paddy was one of around  pigeons

  
used by the British during World War II
to speedily transport secret messages

  
In fact pigeon delivery systems
are ancient human practices

  
Seeing their meat as a protein source

  
and their nitrogenrich poop 
as the perfect fertilizer

  
humans brought pigeons into captivity
as far back as  years ago

  
We then tapped into other traits

  
Pigeons are naturally speedy 
and possess a powerful homing instinct

  
that drives them to navigate
long distances

  
back to the location they consider “home”

  
So we began developing pigeon posts
and breeding and training them for racing

  
In a hobby called 
“pigeon fancying”

  
people selected for traits 
like head plumage

  
and fabulously feathered feet

  
As we carried pigeons around the world
they escaped or were released

  
forming the wild urban flocks
we're familiar with today

  
Pigeons are now one of the most abundant
widespread species on the planet

  
managing to thrive in chaotic cities

  
They owe their success to an ideal
combination of traits

  
including some that were
accentuated by humans

  
Unlike birds that nest 
on the ground or in trees

  
pigeons were originally cliffdwellers

  
City buildings mimic 
their natural habitat

  
And pigeons set a notoriously 
low bar when it comes to homemaking

  
Add some sticks to any window ledge
or highway overpass

  
and it's a great spot to raise babies

  
This unfussiness allows them to live 
in environments

  
where more specialized species can’t

  
As generalists pigeons take advantage 
of urban food waste

  
With an organ in their throats 
called a crop

  
they can gorge themselves when food is
available and store some for later

  
They provide “crop milk” to their young
instead of having to fetch them live food

  
Chicks grow quickly with this 
fat and proteinrich meal

  
If conditions are right
pigeons breed yearround

  
and produce new offspring every six weeks

  
They actually have higher breeding rates
in cities

  
because of the abundance 
of food and shelter

  
These booming populations 
attract predators

  
New York City is home 
to a million pigeons

  
which support large populations
of raptors

  
But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight

  
further exploited by being bred
for racing

  
means they’re made 
for high speed chases

  
Compared to barn owls
which are a similar size

  
pigeon wing bones are thicker 
and more curved

  
providing extra space for muscle mass

  
They can reach speeds 
of  kilometers per hour

  
And their large flocks ensure safety
in numbers and more eyes on the lookout

  
While pigeons play a starring role
in urban wildlife

  
we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors

  
In  New York’s parks commissioner
coined the term “rats with wings”

  
and it stuck

  
Indeed their poop

  
which we originally cherished 
as fertilizer presents a unique problem

  
Just one pigeon can leave behind 
 kilograms of acidic excrement per year

  
which in the United States 
scales to about $ billion

  
in structural damage annually

  
Though incidents of infection are rare

  
this poop can host fungi 
that are harmful to people if inhaled

  
They may be numerous noisy 
and a little too keen on your lunch

  
but the pigeons that swirl around us

  
are evidence of an ancient 
ongoing relationship

  
Their rise to world domination has been
a collaborative effort

  
For better or for worse 
we did this to ourselves

  
The world can be a toxic place

  
No one knows this more
than women and girls

  
cis and trans

  
as well as nonbinary people

  
I am a journalist

  
with  years’ experience

  
reporting on the injustices women
and others face around the world

  
I’m a cofounder of the Man Up Campaign

  
to energize youth activism
against sexual and genderbased violence

  
I’m a father to two daughters

  
I’m a life partner to a woman

  
and I’m a Black man in America

  
Holding these identities 

  
and many more 

  
I say this call to action to you

  
with the deepest sincerity

  
and utmost gravity

  
It is time for a gender reckoning

  
beginning with men authentically
confronting our internal selves

  
and each other

  
through the toxicity within us

  
Against the backdrop
of Black Lives Matter protest

  
cries for a racial reckoning
have echoed throughout the world

  
at times seeming premature

  
and largely misunderstood

  
I believe a true gender reckoning
must be the center

  
of any transformative movement
for social justice and equity

  
But what is a reckoning

  
Dictionaries say it means
to resolve a bill or a debt

  
In other words to settle an account

  
In the case of women and girls

  
what is the debt owed to them

  
Who’s to pay it

  
And how

  
The consequences of male toxicity
continue building

  
the debt to which I refer

  
including among others

  
a gender wealth gap most affecting women
who care for their families

  
as well as act as the primary
income generators

  
for their households

  
Today in the United States and abroad

  
threats to reproductive justice endanger
the lives and hardfought rights of women

  
in regards to their bodily
sexual and gender autonomy

  
impacting the most disenfranchised
community in society

  
And violence against women

  
in all of its forms

  
still represents
an existential challenge

  
as we’ve seen domestic violence
rise in the pandemic

  
as people were confined to their homes

  
we’ve seen online and public
harassment flourish

  
unabated

  
The sexual trafficking

  
prostitution

  
exploitation of women and girls
thrives as ever before

  
From where does this toxicity come

  
and why

  
Men are not endangered

  
we’re not under assault

  
we’re not being unfairly maligned

  
In fact it’s men or certain types of
masculinity that are the issue

  
To be clear

  
being a man does not make me

  
or anyone else who identifies as a man

  
inherently toxic

  
But masculinity

  
in certain forms

  
can harm women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
and men

  
through violence

  
dominating power

  
and control

  
So how do we address this

  
How can we men step up

  
and better support our daughters

  
our sisters

  
our female partners

  
our colleagues neighbors and friends

  
Through what means can men both instigate
and lead a gender reckoning

  
First we must tell the truth

  
We must tell the truth

  
Men grow into this world
becoming who we’re expected to be

  
or who we think we’re expected to be

  
based on cultural expectations

  
and inaccurate historical narratives

  
As a short chubby Black kid
wearing glasses growing up

  
I was repeatedly told I cried too much

  
I’m too emotional

  
too soft

  
It was ingrained in me
that to prove my masculinity

  
I had to display physical prowess 

  
intimidation

  
Because of that indoctrination

  
as an adult

  
I refused to seek help
facing escalating health challenges

  
including high blood pressure

  
and mental trauma

  
The archetype of manhood nearly killed me

  
I say that as a survivor
of two heart attacks

  
four years on dialysis

  
and a kidney transplant 

  
aside from the physical risk
I put myself into

  
covering wars around the world

  
The injury we do to ourselves

  
and the women around us

  
comes from fear of losing control

  
of lack of external affirmation

  
and simply out of shame

  
Manhood is a spectrum of identities

  
There is no one way to be a man

  
And sometimes discovering one’s true
manhood is a lifelong journey

  
Secondly

  
we must be consistent

  
Men

  
especially men of color

  
cannot expect women to stand up for us

  
with us in the face
of systemic oppressions

  
when too often we do not
do the same for them

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
(Applause)

  
The Black Lives Matter
movement for example

  
founded named and led
by queer women of color

  
still centers Black men’s wellbeing

  
in the face of unfair policing

  
and criminal justice systems

  
And where’s the reciprocal
support from those men

  
including myself

  
in addressing intercommunity violence
against women of color

  
maternal health inequity

  
economic disparity

  
How and where do men show up for women

  
I wonder 

  
how many men stood with women
on the steps of the US Supreme Court

  
as they fought for reproductive rights

  
How many men should have been there

  
Finally there can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
There can be no reckoning
without accountability

  
Men who commit acts of violence against
women must be held accountable

  
by formal systems of justice

  
as well as other men

  
Silence in the face of misogynistic
behavior and language is complicity

  
We men need to break free from the pack

  
take concrete actions to stop violence

  
create safety

  
and build equity

  
And most importantly

  
say something

  
To be sure

  
bold men around us are actively working
to disrupt the narrative of male toxicity

  
After the  earthquake in Haiti

  
a local organization

  
KOFAVIV

  
invited men to be defenders of women
and girls in displacement camps

  
women and girls who were
at risk of sexual assault

  
Scores of men answered the call

  
and can continue to do so today

  
In New York City

  
CONNECT NYC

  
led by a Black man

  
actively engages community partners
across civil society

  
to address family violence

  
And in a profession not known generally
for its advocacy against gender violence

  
a professional player
for the Washington Football Team

  
has become an unabashed advocate

  
for men to learn

  
and actively change behaviors
regarding sexual and physical violence

  
There is hope;

  
there is light

  
Men around the world
are putting in the work

  
to catalyze a true gender reckoning

  
But far more are needed

  
What I want to say to you today is this

  
Too many of us 

  
too many men 

  
don’t understand

  
that equity

  
justice

  
inclusivity

  
safety for women girls
and nonbinary people

  
serves and saves us all

  
Broken masculinity harms societies

  
full stop

  
When we men reckon with that truth

  
we will finally find our shared humanity

  
Women

  
girls

  
nonbinary people

  
men

  
standing together on equal footing

  
with mutual respect

  
in safe environments

  
is the greatest
gender reckoning we can create

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Imagine a scientist

  
who wants to send a robot
to explore in a faraway place

  
a place whose geography
might be completely unknown

  
and perhaps inhospitable

  
Now imagine that instead
of first designing that robot

  
and sending it off in the hope
that it might be suitable

  
instead she sends
a robotproducing technology

  
that figures out what kind of robot
is needed once it arrives

  
builds it and then enables it
to continue to evolve

  
to adapt to its new surroundings

  
It’s exactly what my collaborators
and I are working on

  
a radical new technology
which enables robots to be created

  
reproduce and evolve
over long periods of time

  
a technology where robot design
and fabrication becomes a task

  
for machines rather than humans

  
Robots are already all around us
in factories in hospitals in our home

  
But from an engineer's perspective

  
designing a shelfstacking robot
or a Roomba to clean our home

  
is relatively straightforward

  
We know exactly what they need to do

  
and we can imagine the kind of situations
they might find themselves in

  
So we design with this in mind

  
But what if we want
to send that robot to operate

  
in a place that we have little
or even no knowledge about

  
For example cleaning up legacy waste
inside a nuclear reactor

  
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
mining for minerals deep in a trench
at the bottom of the ocean

  
or exploring a faraway asteroid

  
How frustrating would it be
if the humandesigned robot

  
that had taken years
to get to the asteroid

  
suddenly found it needed to drill a hole

  
to collect a sample or clamber up a cliff

  
but it didn't have the right tools

  
or the right means of locomotion to do so

  
If instead we had a technology

  
that enabled the robots to be designed
and optimized in situ

  
in the environment
in which they need to live and work

  
then we could potentially save
years of wasted effort

  
and produce robots
that are uniquely adapted

  
to the environments
that they find themselves in

  
So to realize this technology
we've been turning to nature for help

  
All around us

  
we see examples of biological species

  
that have evolved smart adaptations

  
that enable them to thrive
in a given environment

  
For example in the Cuban rainforest

  
we find vines that have evolved leaves

  
that are shaped like
humandesigned satellite dishes

  
These leaves direct bats to their flowers

  
by amplifying the signals
that the bats send out

  
therefore improving pollination

  
What if we could create
an artificial version of evolution

  
that would enable robots
to evolve in a similar manner

  
as biological organisms

  
I'm not talking about biomimicry

  
a technology which simply copies
what's observed in nature

  
What we're hoping to harness
is the creativity of evolution

  
to discover designs
that are not observed here on Earth

  
the human engineer
might not have thought of

  
or even be capable of conceiving

  
In theory

  
this evolutionary design technology
could operate completely autonomously

  
in a faraway place

  
But equally it could be guided by humans

  
Just as we breed plants for qualities
such as drought resistance or taste

  
the human robot breeder could guide
artificial evolution to producing robots

  
with specific qualities

  
For example

  
the ability to squeeze
through a narrow gap

  
or perhaps operate at low energy

  
This idea of artificial evolution
imitating biological evolution

  
using a computer program

  
to breed better and better solutions
to problems over time

  
isn't actually new

  
In fact artificial evolution

  
algorithms operating inside a computer

  
have been used to design everything
from tables to turbine blades

  
Back in 

  
NASA even sent a satellite into space
with a communication antenna

  
that had been designed
by artificial evolution

  
But evolving robots
is actually much harder

  
than evolving passive objects
such as tables

  
because robots need brains
as well as bodies

  
in order to make sense of the information
in the world around them

  
and translate that
into appropriate behaviors

  
So how do we do it

  
Surprisingly evolution only needs
three ingredients

  
a population of individuals which
exhibit some physical variations;

  
a method of reproduction

  
in which offspring inherit
some traits from their parents

  
and occasionally acquire
new ones via mutation;

  
and finally a means of natural selection

  
So we can replicate these three
ingredients to evolve robots

  
using a mixture of hardware and software

  
The first task is to design
a digital version of DNA

  
That is a digital blueprint that describes
the robot's brain its body

  
its sensory mechanisms
and its means of locomotion

  
Using a randomly generated
set of these blueprints

  
we can create an initial population
of  or more robots

  
to kickstart this evolutionary process

  
We've designed a technology
that can take the digital blueprint

  
and turn it into a physical robot
without any need for human assistance

  
For example it uses a D printer
to print the skeleton of the robot

  
and then an automated assembly arm
like you might find in a factory

  
to add any electronics and moving parts

  
including a small computer
that acts as a brain

  
And to enable this brain to adapt
to the new body of the robot

  
we send every robot produced
to an equivalent of a kindergarten

  
a place where the newborn robot
can refine its motor skills

  
almost like a small child would

  
To mimic natural selection

  
we score these robots
on the ability to conduct a task

  
And then we use these scores

  
to selectively decide
which robots get to reproduce

  
The reproduction mechanism

  
mixes the digital DNA
of the chosen parent robots

  
to create a new blueprint
for a child robot

  
that inherits some of the
characteristics from its parents

  
but occasionally also
exhibits some new ones

  
And by repeating the cycle of selection
and reproduction over and over again

  
we hope that we can breed
successive generations of robots

  
where just like is often observed
in biological evolution

  
each generation gets better than the last

  
with the robots gradually optimizing
their form and their behavior

  
to the task and the environment
that they find themselves in

  
Now although this can all take place

  
in a time frame that's much faster
than biological evolution

  
which sometimes takes thousands of years

  
it's still relatively slow in terms
of the time frames we might expect

  
in our modern world

  
to design and produce an artifact

  
It's mainly due
to the D printing process

  
which can take more
than four hours per robot

  
depending on the complexity
and the shape of the robot

  
But we can give our artificial
evolutionary process a helping hand

  
to reduce the number of physical robots
that we actually need to make

  
We create a digital copy
of every robot produced

  
inside a simulation in a computer

  
and we allow this virtual
population of robots to evolve

  
Now it's quite likely that the simulation
isn't a very accurate representation

  
of the real world

  
But it has an advantage that it enables
models of robots to be created

  
and tested in seconds rather than hours

  
So using the simulator technology

  
we can quickly explore the potential
of a wide range of robot types

  
of different shapes and sizes
of different sensory configurations

  
and quickly get a rough estimate
of how useful each robot may be

  
before we physically make it

  
And we predict that by allowing
a novel form of breeding

  
in which a physical robot can breed
with one of its virtual cousins

  
then the useful traits
that have been discovered in simulation

  
will quickly spread into
the physical robot population

  
where they can be further refined in situ

  
It might sound like science fiction

  
but actually there's a serious point

  
While we expect the technology
that I've just described

  
to be useful in designing robots

  
for example to work in situations
where it's unsafe to send humans

  
or to help us pursue our scientific quest
for exoplanetary exploration

  
there are some more pragmatic reasons

  
why we should consider
artificial evolution

  
As climate change gathers pace

  
it is clear that we need a radical rethink

  
to our approach to robotic
design here on Earth

  
in order to reduce
that ecological footprint

  
For example

  
creating new designs of robot
built from sustainable materials

  
that operate at low energy

  
that are repairable and recyclable

  
It's quite likely that this
new generation of robots

  
won't look anything like the robots
that we see around us today

  
but that's exactly why
artificial evolution might help

  
Discovering novel designs by processes
that are unfettered by the constraints

  
that our own understanding
of engineering science

  
imposes on the design process

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Around the globe

  
there are approximately  million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

  
to escape war violence and persecution

  
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons

  
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries

  
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries

  
They are commonly referred to as refugees

  
But what exactly does that term mean

  
The world has known refugees 
for millennia

  
but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's  Convention

  
relating to the status of refugees

  
in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War

  
It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality

  
and is unable to return 
to their home country

  
because of wellfounded fears
of being persecuted

  
That persecution may be due to their race
religion nationality

  
membership in a particular social group
or political opinion

  
and is often related to war and violence

  
Today roughly half the world's refugees
are children

  
some of them unaccompanied by an adult

  
a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor

  
or sexual exploitation

  
Each refugee's story is different

  
and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes

  
But before we get 
to what their journeys involve

  
let's clear one thing up

  
There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms

  
"migrant" and "refugee"

  
"Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country

  
for reasons not related to persecution

  
such as searching 
for better economic opportunities

  
or leaving droughtstricken areas
in search of better circumstances

  
There are many people around the world
who have been displaced

  
because of natural disasters

  
food insecurities

  
and other hardships

  
but international law rightly or wrongly

  
only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees

  
So what happens when someone
flees their country

  
Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous

  
with limited access to shelter
water or food

  
Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected

  
belongings might be left behind

  
and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents

  
like visas to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries

  
Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling

  
by standard routes

  
This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea

  
and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers

  
to help them cross borders

  
Whereas some people seek safety
with their families

  
others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind

  
with the hopes of being reunited later

  
This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long

  
While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities

  
sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp

  
usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments

  
Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures

  
offering shortterm shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home

  
be integrated to the host country

  
or resettle in another country

  
But resettlement and longterm 
integration options are often limited

  
So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years

  
and sometimes even decades

  
Once in a new country the first legal
step for a displaced person

  
is to apply for asylum

  
At this point they are an asylum seeker

  
and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted

  
While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee

  
every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum

  
and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee

  
Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially

  
Host countries have several duties

  
towards people they have 
recognized as refugees

  
like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and nondiscrimination

  
The most basic obligation towards refugees
is nonrefoulement

  
a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual

  
to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened

  
In reality however refugees are
frequently the victims

  
of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment

  
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia

  
and racism

  
And all too often they aren't permitted
to enter the work force

  
and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid

  
In addition far too many refugee children
are out of school

  
due to lack of funding 
for education programs

  
If you go back in your own family history

  
chances are you will discover that
at a certain point

  
your ancestors were forced 
from their homes

  
either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution

  
It would be good of us to remember
their stories

  
when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced

  
searching for a new home

  
We're going to have hotter
drier summers in our cities

  
We're going to have to deal
with more frequent and intense heat waves

  
It's going to have an impact
on our health and wellbeing

  
but not just us

  
What about the plants and animals
that call our cities home

  
So what could we do about that

  
We could green our cities
we could plant trees

  
The shade provided by trees
provides protection

  
from those impacts of the heat

  
But what do we need to make
those plants thrive and survive

  
We need water

  
Our green cities need water
but mosquitoes also like water

  
And so how can we balance the impacts
that come from both of those

  
if we perhaps are inadvertently
creating increasing pests

  
and public health risks for ourselves

  
in the ways in which we try to respond
to a changing climate

  
How can we green our cities
and not create a problem with mosquitoes

  
The mosquito is the deadliest
animal on the planet

  
About half a million people die every year
because of mosquito bite

  
Diseases such as malaria and dengue

  
infect hundreds of millions
of people every year across the planet

  
That burden of disease
weighs quite heavily

  
on both communities and local authorities

  
as they struggle to try to deal
with those impacts

  
Here in Australia
we're very fortunate to be free

  
of some of the more serious
mosquitoborne diseases

  
but there are still pathogens
spread by local mosquitoes

  
that can make us sick

  
So something like Ross River virus

  
If we get infected with this virus
we may not die

  
but we could get seriously ill

  
Fever rash joint pain fatigue 

  
We could be battling illness
for many months

  
But notwithstanding the burden of disease

  
what about the nuisance that mosquitoes
can have just to our daytoday lives

  
How many of you have been
bothered by mosquitoes

  
when you're outside enjoying the barbecue

  
or visiting the local wetlands
during summer

  
What about that mosquito
that buzzes around your bedroom at night

  
How can we manage these risks
and move forward

  
and try to live in a greener city

  
and not create opportunities
for mosquitoes

  
So I spend my summers
sloshing about in wetlands

  
wrangling mosquitoes

  
Despite the sunburn
and the mosquito bites and the mud

  
I actually do quite like my job

  
And I've also got a confession
to make to you all 

  
I actually quite like mosquitoes

  
(Laughter)

  
I'm quite fascinated by them

  
I think they're actually quite beautiful

  
if you get a chance to look at them
underneath the microscope

  
So before I started my research

  
and first looked through
a microscope at a mosquito

  
I don't think I'd really given them
much of a thought

  
I knew that they were involved
in outbreaks of disease overseas

  
and I was quite familiar with that smell
of a smoldering mosquito coil

  
It still reminds me of summer holidays

  
But the work I do now

  
together with that of scientists
around the country

  
is trying to work out how we can
stop people getting sick

  
because of mosquito bites

  
It requires us to understand

  
the role that mosquitoes have
in our local environment

  
and how we can change our cities

  
so that we're greening our cities

  
we're mitigating those impacts
of climate change

  
but at the same time not creating
opportunities for mosquitoes

  
Did you know there are over 
different types of mosquitoes

  
that are found in Western Sydney

  
So it's not just that one mosquito
that you slap on your arm and squash;

  
they're an incredibly diverse
and interesting range of animals

  
There's  different types
across Western Sydney

  
These mosquitoes might be big
they might be small

  
They might be black
with distinctively striped legs

  
They might be a pale brown color

  
Or they might be
a really vibrant orange color

  
But one of the things I love
about all of these mosquitoes

  
is that they're very unique

  
they've adapted to very different
types of environment

  
It’s one of the reasons that I like them
because they’re incredibly adaptive

  
But it’s also the thing
that worries me about them

  
because they could be adapting
to these sources of water

  
we're creating around our cities

  
So mosquitoes are found in an incredibly
wide range of environments

  
from coastal rock pools

  
to snowmelt streams in our Alpine regions

  
from polluted drains to pristine wetlands

  
and almost every puddle
of water in between

  
There are mosquitoes found
in all of these environments

  
And understanding how the mosquitoes
interact with these environments

  
and the climate

  
is really important to understand
how they might play a role

  
in outbreaks of disease

  
But all of these mosquitoes
essentially need two things

  
they need blood and they need water

  
So I'll get to the blood
in a little while

  
but let me talk to you about why water
is really important for mosquitoes

  
The humble mossie is a really frail
and fragile creature

  
Looks like it'll fall apart
in a strong breeze

  
It's hard to imagine these are the most
dangerous animals on the planet

  
But these animals kind of rely on water;

  
they've got an amazing life cycle
that starts in the water

  
They need water

  
So eggs are laid in and around
sources of water

  
and then when it rains
or tides come into the wetlands

  
these eggs hatch and out of these eggs
hatch these wormlike larvae

  
that swim around in the water

  
Maybe you’ve seen them in puddles
or your pot plant saucers

  
Or maybe as I did as a child

  
if you're a bit slow to clean
your backyard swimming pool

  
when warmer weather arrives

  
all of a sudden
you can see these mosquitoes

  
swimming around at the top of the water

  
But during summer
it might only take a week or so

  
for them to emerge from that water
and start flying around

  
They only live for a few weeks

  
but during that time
they can bite a lot of people

  
and they can lay
more than a thousand eggs

  
But to get those eggs they need blood

  
Mosquitoes need blood
that's why they bite

  
It's only the female mosquito that bites

  
and she needs that protein hit
in her blood to develop her eggs

  
They can live quite happily on plant
juices and sugars most of the time

  
but they really need
that blood to develop eggs

  
And the animals they can get
that blood from can be incredibly varied

  
from cows and kangaroos
to birds to frogs

  
But also us

  
And I know some of us in this room
you're probably thinking

  
"Boy mosquitoes sure like to bite me

  
more than they like to bite my friends"

  
And sometimes we can be
a bit unlucky like that

  
But it's also important to remember
that mosquitoes when they bite

  
can not only create
an itchy red lump on our skin

  
but they can also make us sick

  
They can transmit pathogens
that make us sick

  
But mosquitoes aren’t flying around

  
transferring droplets of infected blood
from person to person

  
These are not dirty syringes;

  
they’re much more complicated organisms

  
So the mosquitoes themselves
have to become infected with the pathogen

  
before they can pass that on to us

  
And when it comes
to pathogen transmission

  
not all mosquitoes are created equal

  
It's why it's really important
to understand mosquitoes

  
because even though we have dozens
of mosquitoes here in Sydney

  
that could transmit
something like Ross River virus

  
there are no mosquitoes
currently in Sydney

  
that can transmit the pathogens
that cause more serious diseases

  
things like dengue chikungunya or Zika

  
Let's hope it stays that way

  
So what does a green city
look like for a mosquito

  
So first of all there are trees
that provide shade

  
protection from wind and sun 

  
It provides these kind of protected
humid little areas

  
where mosquitoes can take refuge

  
The longer mosquitoes live

  
the more people they bite

  
the more eggs they lay

  
But it’s not so much the plants
but the water they need

  
which is really critical for mosquitoes

  
So in a green city we have water tanks

  
we build wetlands

  
We’ve got green walls and frog ponds

  
We’ve got bioretention basins

  
We’ve got rain gardens

  
All of these structures that might be
designed to store and recycle water

  
in and around our cities and suburbs

  
could be used by mosquitoes

  
Remember mosquitoes love this water
that's available to them

  
So how can we design our cities

  
so that mosquitoes aren't quick to adapt
to these types of environments

  
Wherever there's water
mosquitoes will lay eggs

  
and we have to be mindful about that
as we try to respond and green our cities

  
create the structures that will help us

  
It'll make a city greater

  
I want to live in a green city

  
I would love to live in a green city;

  
it's probably great for my physical
and mental health and wellbeing

  
I just don't want to share that
with too many mosquitoes

  
And mosquitoes are so adaptive

  
that I'm sure that they're going
to create opportunities

  
in these structures that we're building

  
and so I'm really worried

  
that we're going to see
more and more mosquitoes into the future

  
So how do you create a wetland
that's not home to mosquitoes

  
One of the really interesting pieces
of research we've found in recent years

  
is that problematic mosquito populations

  
often seem to be associated
with wetlands of poor health

  
wetlands that have more stagnant water

  
wetlands that don't have enough predators
to eat the mosquitoes

  
So it’s a tantalizing idea

  
that if you can create
a wetland that's healthier

  
it has more water flow

  
it has a greater level of biodiversity

  
you can actually keep
mosquito populations down

  
If you provide habitats
for the animals that eat mosquitoes 

  
the birds the bats
the fish the frogs the spiders

  
any number of aquatic insects
that love munching on mosquitoes 

  
rather than being a problem

  
mosquitoes are not going to disappear

  
we're not going to get rid
of mosquitoes completely

  
but if they're at a more balanced
place in the ecosystem

  
maybe we'll have fewer pest impacts

  
and more importantly

  
maybe we will see less
mosquitoborne disease

  
But what about stormwater drains

  
These are already a common sight
in our local wetlands

  
and there's a mosquito
that calls these habitats home

  
which you all already know

  
You may not notice it
when it flies past you

  
but you know its sound

  
You've probably learned to hate
the sound of this mosquito

  
more so than its bite

  
This is a mosquito called
the brown house mosquito

  
It loves breeding in polluted ponds
and pipes and waterways;

  
it's going to be quick to exploit

  
the ways in which we store
wastewater in our cities

  
The thing is about this mosquito

  
is that it loves coming indoors at night

  
It's the mosquito that's going to be
buzzing around your face at night

  
keep you awake disrupting your sleep

  
Now the reason you can hear that mosquito

  
is not because it makes a sound
that's different to any other mosquito

  
It's just that a mosquito
prefers to bite birds

  
and so it's flying
around your face and your body

  
responding to your heat
and the smell of your skin working out

  
"Is this a large featherless bird

  
I'm not sure whether
I want to bite it or not"

  
It's bad luck for those of you
who smell a bit like a bird

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's a reminder that sometimes

  
it's not just the bite of mosquitoes
that's the problem

  
it's the disturbance that can be caused
by large numbers of mosquitoes

  
And so we don't want these mosquitoes
coming inside our homes

  
where we're kind of creating opportunities
for these mosquitoes in our cities

  
So what about our backyards

  
We all want to keep our backyards healthy

  
we want to have a great opportunity
for our plants and our pets

  
and the local wildlife

  
One effective way to do that
is installing a rainwater tank

  
Problem is rainwater tanks
can be a great source

  
for very serious mosquitoes

  
You all in this room
have probably been bitten

  
by the Australian backyard mosquito

  
Its scientific name is Aedes notoscriptus

  
It is the most widespread
mosquito in Australia;

  
almost everybody has opportunities
for this mosquito in their backyard

  
Whether it's a birdbath
a pot plant saucer

  
even the smallest volumes of water
trapped in a waterholding container

  
will be a place this mosquito
can lay its eggs

  
It's a nuisance biting pest

  
but it's not a serious threat
to our health

  
But there's a problem here

  
because these same habitats
where this mosquito is found

  
could also be the home of a mosquito

  
that's associated with the transmission
of much more serious pathogens

  
pathogens that can cause
outbreaks of disease

  
such as dengue chikungunya and Zika

  
These mosquitoes
are the Asian tiger mosquito

  
or the yellow fever mosquito

  
These two mosquitoes are not found
in Sydney at the moment

  
but worldwide they contribute to major
outbreaks of mosquitoborne disease

  
They don't breed in wetlands

  
they love these waterholding
containers in our backyards

  
And as we do a better job
of creating these opportunities

  
like rainwater tanks in our backyards

  
maybe we're creating an opportunity
for these mosquitoes to move in

  
The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti

  
was actually once common in Sydney

  
but during the 's it disappeared

  
One of the reasons for its disappearance

  
could well have been the fact
that we moved away from rainwater tanks

  
And now rainwater tanks are coming back

  
They're going to become more common

  
And could that see the return
of these mosquitoes

  
I certainly hope not

  
So what can authorities do
about reducing the mosquitoes

  
associated with these greening cities
that we're dealing with

  
There's a role for our local authorities

  
to consider mosquitoes
when they're building wetlands

  
creating wastewater recycling schemes

  
regulating the installation
of rainwater tanks

  
Because these are dynamic systems

  
It's not just about
how you design them and build them

  
but it's how you maintain them

  
You can't just build them and walk away

  
because as we've learned

  
if these habitats degrade
they become more suitable for mosquitoes

  
These types of structures

  
these wetlands
in our cities they're great

  
They help reduce pollution
they help store water

  
but we don't want them to become
an opportunity for mosquitoes

  
But what about us

  
There's a role for local government
for our local authorities

  
but how an we help protect
our families and our friends

  
from the impact of mosquitoes
associated with a greening city

  
I'm going to leave you with three tips

  
that can help you stop
the bite of mosquitoes

  
and the buzz of mosquitoes this summer

  
First of all

  
don't create opportunities
for mosquitoes in your backyard

  
Anything that traps water after rainfall
will be a source of mosquitoes

  
so tip out cover up or remove
these waterholding containers

  
in your backyard

  
Screen your rainwater tanks

  
Clean your gutters and your drains

  
reduce that standing water
that mosquitoes love so much

  
around our homes

  
Secondly

  
insect repellents are a safe
and effective way

  
to avoid mosquito bites

  
When you're choosing a formulation

  
from the local pharmacy
or the supermarket

  
make sure you apply it
as a nice even coat

  
over all exposed areas of skin

  
Don't put it on like perfume

  
A dab here or there
is not going to provide protection

  
Unless you've got complete cover
those mosquitoes will find a way

  
to find that gap
in your repellent and bite

  
Lastly a way that you might be able
to stop the buzz of mosquitoes

  
Why not just switching on a fan

  
We know that operating a fan in a bedroom
can help reduce those mosquitoes

  
that come in and buzz around
our ears at night

  
It disperses the smells
and the temperatures

  
around that body that attracts them;

  
it might make it a bit harder
for that mossie

  
to fly around and find us as well

  
So finally I want to leave you
with a thought

  
We may hate mosquitoes and I understand

  
I don’t want to convert you
into loving these bloodsuckers

  
But we need to understand them

  
Because if we can’t understand
the diversity of mosquitoes

  
and their relationships
with the environments

  
we’re creating in our green cities

  
it's going to become
a much greater struggle

  
to kind of reduce the burden of disease
that might come with them

  
And unfortunately

  
mosquitoes are going to be
yet another challenge we face

  
as we move forward into our future cities

  
under the impact of a changing climate

  
As a new widow Sarah Rosas Garcia

  
was already struggling to support
her nine children

  
when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities

  
Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school

  
and being sexually promiscuous

  
so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents

  
committed her to a state hospital

  
After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score

  
the doctors made their verdict

  
They told Sara her yearold daughter
would be sterilized

  
to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency

  
This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime

  
But in fact it took place 
in Southern California in 

  
And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color

  
targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics

  
Since ancient Greece there have been
efforts to control human populations

  
via reproduction retaining some
traits and removing others

  
But in the th century the discovery
of evolution and genetics

  
inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor

  
In  British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton

  
named this idea eugenics

  
drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born”

  
This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists

  
and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society

  
by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down

  
However their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable

  
was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era

  
Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction

  
including immigrants people of color
and people with disabilities

  
Meanwhile their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members

  
white Europeans
of Nordic or AngloSaxon descent

  
As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early th century

  
many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions

  
These measures to improve socalled
“racial hygiene”

  
were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany

  
The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews

  
as well as individuals from other groups

  
including Roma gay men 
and people with disabilities

  
Outside their extreme brutality however

  
Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe

  
Throughout the midth century

  
many countries enacted eugenics policies

  
and governments in Sweden 
Canada and Japan

  
forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals

  
Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US

  
From  to 

  
US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over  people

  
with  states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization

  
for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective”

  
This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses

  
and the results of IQ tests

  
which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations

  
These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California

  
From  to  Latina women were 
% more likely to be sterilized

  
than other women

  
And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high—

  
this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations

  
Such was the case of Andrea Garcia

  
whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates

  
With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus

  
Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law

  
violated the US Constitution

  
depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law

  
However while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea

  
the other two did not

  
Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery

  
but many more victims 
of these policies did not

  
Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations

  
after the horrors of World War II

  
many of its practices including
sterilization continued for decades

  
By the late s research 
into human genetics was more nuanced

  
and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence

  
Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization

  
well into the s

  
Finally class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers

  
and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 

  
Unfortunately today

  
the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities

  
still continues around the globe

  
Anna Malaika Tubbs "The Three Mothers"

  
is about Alberta King
Berdis Baldwin and Louise Little

  
the mothers of MLK Jr
James Baldwin and Malcolm X

  
And I wrote this book

  
to not only celebrate
these three incredible life stories

  
that we should have known
for years and years before my book

  
but to also think about what their stories
could symbolize for Black women

  
Black mothers mothers more generally

  
and what it could mean
to save their stories

  
from being forgotten from being erased

  
and how it changes our understanding
of where we are as a nation today

  
how we have arrived here

  
what are changes
that we still need to make

  
Whitney Pennington Rogers That's great

  
I think in reading it

  
you can feel how really lovingly
you put all of this together

  
and did this research and the attention
that you put to this

  
this really comes through
in the finished product

  
Well we have we have
a question from Jeff

  
Jeff says that "As a father
this talk changed my life

  
I bought the book a few copies
and was in the audience in December live

  
and it generated this concern for me

  
How much history was impacted
with lack of mother's input

  
especially Black mothers”

  
And that's the question

  
AMT Oh it's a big question

  
First thank you Jeff
I really appreciate that

  
So much of our history
we are missing these stories

  
And the feeling that you felt
in being in that audience

  
and that I felt
in uncovering these stories

  
and every piece of the puzzle that I found

  
just really shocked me

  
that we didn't know these things
already and infuriated me

  
And it really caused me some deep sadness

  
because I realized
how many more stories are 

  
I mean we're missing so many

  
and of course not everybody
is going to be famous

  
and not everyone’s going to have
a book written about them

  
But it's very very unique this erasure
of Black women's contributions

  
It is very intentional

  
Like I said with "Hidden
Figures" as an example

  
why would we not know that Black women
were the mathematicians

  
called "the computers"
behind a space launch

  
That is critical information
for our history

  
And for me to think
as a young Black woman

  
when I was sitting in school

  
when I was a young Black girl

  
what that could have meant
to me to know that

  
That it was a part not only of 

  
I could not be the first Black
woman to do something

  
but that there was a history before me

  
of Black female mathematicians

  
and these brilliant brains

  
And even as much as you know

  
my parents educated me on my Black
history and my African history

  
because even I have a privilege
that many Black Americans do not have

  
I knew my connection
to my lineage in Ghana etc

  
So much of this history
has been robbed from us

  
And it's a very strategic robbing

  
It's not a mistake

  
So that just thinking
from that perspective

  
we want to continue to uncover
more and more stories

  
of those who have been
intentionally marginalized

  
intentionally oppressed

  
Because the more we can correct
our telling of that story

  
and that history

  
the better we'll do moving forward

  
So these attacks on telling history
right now it's very strategic

  
It’s not again a mistake

  
It's not something
that people are doing unconsciously

  
It’s very “We don’t want
to tell the truth”

  
And we all need to reckon with that

  
and we need to fight against that

  
WPR I think that it's really
interesting in the book

  
that you draw these parallels
between what was happening

  
in the lives of these three women

  
and what we're seeing happening you know

  
play out in the news today

  
or have seen happen at other
moments in history during their lives

  
And you know I'm curious
to hear how you think

  
writing this book changed your perspective

  
on the experiences of mothers currently

  
just how you think about motherhood today

  
AMT Yeah this is something
that I already knew was an issue

  
Going back to my mom
she would always say

  
in every place that we travel
to pay attention

  
to how women are being treated
in the society

  
how mothers very specifically
are being treated

  
That is an indicator on how successful
this community will be

  
And so I always carry that
in the back of my mind

  
I was always aware that
when I moved back to the US for instance

  
that we weren’t really giving mothers
the support that they deserved;

  
we certainly weren’t giving them
the celebration that they deserve

  
and therefore the support was lacking

  
And there was this lack of understanding

  
around the critical
importance of the role

  
But in putting this book out there
and even doing the TED Talk

  
and speaking to so many different
audiences around this

  
it is a dire situation for mothers

  
And whether that's on a personal level

  
where those who have come up
to me and said

  
“I am the mom who feels
unappreciated in my household right now”

  
“I am the mom who feels unseen”

  
To this national level of a crisis

  
where we are fighting for weeks
of parental leave

  
mere weeks

  
This is 

  
It’s upsetting

  
and we should be embarrassed by that

  
These are things that should
have been established by now

  
and I really do 
and I say this in the TED Talk 

  
I truly hope that within my lifetime

  
we can usher in a shift that starts with
first saying “Mothers are essential”

  
We need mothers to be supported

  
because they are holding
so much of our lives together

  
our society together

  
Stayathome moms are performing some
of the most important work in our country

  
and we are devaluing them

  
And not only that we are making them
feel bad about what they are doing

  
This really is an issue
that more of us need to take on

  
Going back to that very first question

  
why this is an issue
for everybody to care about

  
And it sounds obvious

  
but we shouldn't have to say
that if mothers are dying

  
in a maternal health crisis 

  
one that is exacerbated for Black women 

  
the Black maternal health
crisis is alarming

  
but generally the maternal
health crisis in the US is terrible

  
It shouldn't be this way

  
Mothers of all races are dying
more than they should be

  
We need to pay attention to that

  
That's not only bad
for mothers obviously

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to walk away
from their job during the pandemic

  
because there were no supports
in place to catch them

  
It's not only bad for mothers

  
if they have to choose
between being a mother

  
or making money for their family

  
That shouldn't be put on their shoulders

  
There should be supports in place

  
We should have affordable child care

  
We should have universal preschool

  
All of these things that impact mothers
have ripple effects for the rest of us

  
So yes it opened my eyes
to just how alarming

  
and how critical a situation
we're currently in

  
Even though again my mom raised me
to know all of these things

  
Through doing this work

  
I’ve just now been kind of
awoken to the need

  
for people to open their eyes right now

  
WPR M Watson has a question
that actually kind of piggybacks on this

  
more than just thinking about how
we can gain access to these stories

  
they want to know you know

  
what do you feel is the most
effective way we can as a people

  
change the narrative around Black women

  
You know if you have
any specific examples

  
which I know you share some in your talk

  
They ask

  
"How can I personally be involved
in this work of changing this narrative"

  
AMT Great question
and there are levels to this

  
I would say definitely
understanding the history

  
of how Black women
have been treated is very important

  
So again it's a shameless plug
but read the book

  
I talk about not only these three women

  
but again many of the goals that I had

  
one of them also was to explain tropes

  
like the mammy and the matriarch trope

  
and the Jezebel trope

  
and the "welfare queen"
and the strong Black woman trope

  
What all of these have meant
in American history

  
and what their intention was

  
And that is to say that anything
Black women were dealing with

  
was their own fault

  
That with the mammy trope
that we didn't deserve necessarily

  
to be compensated for work
that we were doing

  
that we deserved to stay
within domestic work

  
and that we shouldn't necessarily
be paid what that work was worth

  
because we liked it
and we were happy to be the mammy

  
The Aunt Jemima who was smiling
and wanted to do you know

  
wanted to serve her white family
more than her own

  
The matriarch trope that Black families
have been separated from each other

  
not because of systems
that have made it so that 

  
you know mass incarceration

  
or so many other things
that I can mention

  
but instead because Black women
were emasculating their men

  
Or the Jezebel trope that justified
sexual violence against Black women

  
because that's what Black women wanted

  
they were more promiscuous

  
Even the "welfare queen"

  
saying Black women are having children
just to make money

  
So you have to understand
this is a very long

  
ugly painful history

  
that we are dealing with as Black women
day in and day out

  
And when people don’t get

  
that those are the burdens we are holding

  
years and centuries of being told
that everything that's happening to you

  
the pain you're going through
is because of you

  
and not because of policies
we've voted for

  
or the ways in which we kept you
from being elected

  
or even being able to run for office

  
or even vote

  
That's where it really begins

  
Take the time as much as you can to know
how we've gotten to where it is right now

  
and then to really have a moment
where you fully appreciate

  
the incredible resistance of Black women

  
and the ways in which
we've continued to create life

  
despite the ways that people
have tried to rob it from us

  
And the vision behind what Black women
have been able to accomplish

  
what they have imagined for this world

  
because we can't accept
the situation as it is right now

  
because that dehumanize us

  
But we have pushed this nation forward
to our vision in incredible ways

  
It's not only Stacey Abrams in Georgia

  
it's a long long history
of Black women saying

  
"We don't agree
with the system as it is now

  
So here is how we're going to
help you see the world

  
and the possibilities
from our perspective"

  
And you look at American history
from that angle

  
and it is powerful

  
There is nothing like it

  
And therefore you better understand
why we should elect more Black women

  
why we should vote for them

  
to help usher our country
and continue to do it

  
But with even more support
and even more backing

  
because without that backing
without that support

  
when Black women have been erased
and misrecognized misrepresented

  
we have still created incredible change

  
So now we're asking that we be heard

  
we be listened to

  
and that our energy no longer be spent
on explaining how we got here

  
but instead on how we can do
whatever is next and whatever is possible

  
So it’s kind of a combination
of try to learn our history

  
support us as leaders

  
put those tools in our hands
as much as possible

  
Trust us hear us believe us

  
and also stop wasting our time
on the need to explain the extra

  
when that's work
that we can do on our own

  
That kind of brings me
full circle to my research

  
being around

  
I didn't reach out to the family
until I'd done my part

  
So yeah I mean even attending
a conversation like this

  
is part of doing your part
so kudos to you all

  
We're all real starting today

  
WPR And that's doing your part
to sort to educate yourself

  
on information that already
exists out there it sounds like

  
Beyond what we could do individually
to educate ourselves

  
and make change in this space

  
what can we expect from our government

  
to do more on the national scale

  
and even thinking globally

  
What are some things
that you would like to see

  
so that we change the way
that we as a culture

  
think about Black motherhood

  
AMT For this one

  
because I'll give it quicker answer
than I have in me

  
because you can tell I like to talk
and I can go for a long time

  
But in the book

  
the concluding chapter is entirely
about what we need to do as a world

  
and what are the lessons that Alberta

  
Berdis and Louise’s lives are teaching us
about our next steps forward

  
when it comes to policy
when it comes to 

  
actually even kind of
the threelevel layer

  
that I like to talk about

  
which is the interpersonal level
is an important one

  
The conversations
that we're having with each other

  
and the stories that we're telling

  
when I you know
in the TED Talk a little snippet

  
where we have mothers who feel
like they have to be selfless

  
and that we celebrate mothers
for being selfless

  
So even around Mother's Day
we say to moms

  
"Thank you for sacrificing
everything for me

  
and for putting yourself
behind everybody"

  
And yes a lot of mothers have done that

  
and certainly if they have
we should thank them for that

  
But what we can start to do is shift
that story and that thank you

  
and say "Thank you for doing
everything you could do for us

  
And also thank you for still seeing
yourself as a human being"

  
or "for representing yourself as a human
with a full range of emotions

  
and for teaching me
about my first life lessons

  
for being my first caretaker

  
for being my first leader
for being my first teacher"

  
Those are things that I think
more accurately represent mothering

  
in a way that is sustainable for mothers

  
Where mothers aren't going to burn out

  
where we're not putting all of it on moms

  
and then reiterating it by saying

  
"Thank you for putting yourself
behind everyone else"

  
So that's on like an interpersonal level

  
I do think those conversations
can make a huge difference

  
in terms of what mothers
are even thinking is the goal

  
of what we're trying to achieve

  
and what we want to be thanked for

  
The second level of that is
you know in relationships

  
even beyond our households 

  
And I mean like you said
in terms of Black motherhood

  
very specifically

  
this burden of putting
our needs behind everyone

  
I just did a piece
for “New York” magazine on this

  
that that is further
exacerbated for Black women

  
because we have been seen
as "the mothers" of a movement

  
We're always like mothers
of something much larger

  
and not just like mothers
of our own children

  
but this weight of what's placed upon us

  
And specifically in this article

  
I'm focusing on mothers
whose children have been killed

  
whether by police officers
or neighborhood vigilantes

  
and how in these moments

  
instead of giving these moms
the space to grieve

  
we're asking them to do something
for our entire country

  
You know we ask them to speak to crowds

  
they run for office which can be a part
of their personal healing as well

  
but we interpret that as look at what
this Black woman is doing for all of us

  
rather than us thinking about what is
she going to do for her own healing

  
for her own restoration

  
So that's kind of
the extra layer to that

  
And then thinking about it
on a national level

  
what we're voting for

  
I think about what could
have helped Alberta Berdis and Louise

  
and what we still need
to this day right now

  
So to give a little bit more
information on the women

  
Alberta King had to walk
away from her job

  
because the law stated at the time

  
that married women
were not allowed to teach

  
and she'd always had this dream
of being an educator

  
She had a bachelor's degree
she had a teaching certificate

  
but when she met her husband

  
she made the decision to start a family

  
because this was like
she had to make a decision

  
And even though that law
the marriage bar is not in place now

  
what are the many ways in which
we're pushing women and mothers

  
out of their jobs

  
There are many that still exist
and we need to start addressing those

  
These are just one example
from each woman

  
If we look at Berdis Baldwin

  
she was the victim of an abusive husband
for years years and years

  
And James Baldwin speaks about this often
how abusive his stepfather was

  
But she didn't have anyone
she could really turn to

  
because especially in Black communities

  
we are so afraid of what might happen
if we call a police officer

  
and we have multiple examples of this

  
where we really needed
help and intervention

  
and then somebody ends up
being shot when they're called

  
when police officers
are called to protect us

  
So Berdis Baldwin was aware of this

  
Her children had been harassed
by police officers

  
James Baldwin tells a story
of when he was pushed into an alley

  
and he was maybe  years old
and police officers searched him

  
they were looking for someone

  
and just left him there
on his own this little boy

  
So she's not going to call them
to help her in this situation

  
So she just endures this abuse
all on her own

  
So what are systems we can think about

  
in terms of should there be
other people we can call

  
who are not police officers

  
Should there be you know

  
more support even for social workers
that could come out

  
That's something to think about
and to reflect on

  
And then as an example for Louise Little

  
I mean all three of them have
these different painful traumas

  
that they experience

  
And for Louise one of the major ones

  
is that she is put in an institution
against her will for  years of her life

  
because she was this activist
radical activist

  
who spoke up against white supremacy

  
who stands and facesoff
with the KKK literally

  
And a white male physician was sent
to her house to evaluate her

  
after her husband had been murdered

  
And he concludes that she's
experiencing dementia

  
And in his doctor's note
he says that she is quote

  
"imagining being discriminated against"

  
"Imagining being discriminated against"

  
as a Black woman

  
Black immigrant woman
living in the Midwest

  
and that is enough to put her away
in an institution against her will

  
So in terms of us thinking
about the biases

  
that Black women are facing
when they don't ask for help even

  
and people just decide they're going
to come in and evaluate them

  
especially even when they do
that they're going to be misunderstood

  
that they're going to be told
they're imagining things

  
these are things we need to address

  
So we also have to do an evaluation
of our health care systems

  
and the biases that still exist

  
So it's kind of like this endless list

  
and I definitely don't want to end
on such a heavy and hard note

  
But in that concluding chapter

  
it's called "Our Lives
Will Not Be Erased"

  
that's where I go with it is policy

  
and what we can do

  
Kind of some tangible next steps

  
WPR Well I think that's
so important and so valuable

  
And to your point of not ending
in such a heavy place you know

  
I guess how do you feel though
about the progress we are making

  
M Watson asks do you feel

  
that the Black women
narrative is progressing

  
AMT I am an optimist

  
and I often say that my optimism
lies in this incredible activism

  
that Black women have held for so long

  
and we continue to envision
new realities for this world

  
And that makes me really hopeful

  
To study Alberta Berdis and Louise
who again it's not ancient history

  
Berdis passed away in 

  
Louise passed away in 

  
So this isn't like ancient
ancient history

  
but they did face a lot of things
that I no longer face

  
as a result of their work

  
and a result of what
they were able to accomplish

  
and how they taught their children
to accomplish these things

  
and change the world

  
So I'm not the kind of person
who thinks we are stuck

  
and there is no forward progress
that we've made

  
I feel like that would be really
disrespectful to them if I felt that way

  
because they gave as much
as they could to that progression

  
and it's my turn to carry
that forward as well

  
But what I do hope is that more
people join us in this

  
and that Black women are not continuing
to have to do this on our own

  
That more people will be aware of history

  
I sound like a broken record

  
but be aware of history
so that we can move forward

  
and fight anything that tries
to keep us from telling accurate

  
and full representations
of our country's history

  
Because I think if we're aware of it
then we won't want to repeat it

  
And we have more people who will want
to be allies in this fight

  
And in my contribution to this

  
I'm just hoping I'm giving more of us
tools to join the conversation

  
and think about how we can
carry it forward

So when I was  years old

  
I was a lonely geeky girl;

  
a firstgeneration Latina growing up
in a small Midwestern town

  
where hardly anyone else
had parents who spoke with thick accents

  
But then I came across
Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy

  
“The Lord of the Rings”

  
and I fell in love

  
(Applause)

  
What a cool world of elves

  
orcs

  
and small but heroic hobbits
fighting against impossible odds

  
to defeat a powerful enemy

  
Kind of like life

  
But one thing bothered me

  
There weren’t enough
female characters in this book

  
The adventurers accompanying
the protagonists were all male

  
It made me feel left out

  
like I did in school when 

  
you’re not going to believe this 

  
when my th grade teacher told me

  
“Why are you working so hard in math

  
You should be getting a boyfriend!”

  
(Audience boos)

  
But worse it offended
my sense of fairness

  
Surely girls could have adventures too

  
So what could I do

  
I sat down with my spiral notebook

  
and I rewrote the story

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I regendered a couple
of the main characters

  
and I added new scenes

  
like one where a female hobbit
devised a clever plan

  
to foil the Balrog

  
a monster who caused the death
of one of my favorite characters

  
By reimagining Tolkien’s fantasy world

  
I was creating a place

  
where someone like me could feel at home

  
Writing my story gave me comfort

  
But it also taught me a lot
about how to write

  
I never shared that spiral
notebook with anyone

  
But what I didn’t realize then

  
was I was writing something
called fanfiction 

  
(Laughter)

  
a story based on characters
or settings from another’s work 

  
and that I was not alone

  
It was an experience I never forgot

  
And many years later

  
after I became a data science professor
at the University of Washington

  
in 

  
I met another professor named Katie Davis

  
and we sat down over lunch

  
and discussed a recent news story

  
that claimed “kids today can’t write

  
all they produce
is misspelled short texts”

  
Katie and I didn’t believe it

  
We both knew kids whose writing abilities
defied these stereotypes

  
What’s more the talented young people
we happened to know

  
all had heavy involvement
in fanfiction reading and writing

  
So this apparent contradiction
sparked our exploration

  
into one of my most enduring
research projects

  
a deep data dive

  
into the vast world of fanfiction

  
to study the impact

  
that writing these stories
could have on the writers themselves

  
and whether writing fanfiction
could actually teach kids

  
to become stronger writers

  
And what we found surpassed
anything I could have imagined

  
So let me set the stage

  
For those of you who haven’t
heard the term before

  
fanfiction

  
sometimes known
as transformative literature

  
is said by some to go back centuries

  
After all in the s

  
John Milton wrote “Paradise Lost”
using characters from the Bible

  
(Laughter)

  
But today scholars generally feel

  
that modern fanfiction
traces its origins to typewritten zines

  
written by “Star Trek” fans
in the ‘s and’ s

  
And with the growth of the internet

  
barriers to sharing
have been lowered further

  
Millions of people are writing
and sharing fan fiction

  
on a variety of websites

  
around existing plots like “Harry Potter”

  
“Twilight”

  
“Naruto”

  
“My Little Pony” 

  
(Laughter)

  
and “Pokémon”

  
and many others

  
You probably have
a teenage relative or neighbor

  
who reads or writes fanfiction

  
These stories are wildly diverse

  
and may be creative
thoughtful or hilarious

  
You might find titles like

  
“When Harry Potter
Accidentally Started a Cult”

  
(Laughter)

  
Or “Five Times Hermione Snogged Harry 

  
(Laughter)

  
And One Time She Didn’t”

  
(Laughter)

  
The sheer quantity of fanfiction
that’s been produced is astonishing

  
In the past  years alone

  
over  billion words of fanfiction
have been written

  
and posted on a single online site

  
fanfictionnet

  
which is only one
of many fanfiction hubs

  
Now compare that with the amount
of fiction written in the English language

  
that’s been traditionally published

  
in all of human history 

  
 billion

  
So this is an incredible
outpouring of creativity

  
And on this site it's written
primarily by young people

  
This site’s  million members
write in  different languages

  
and their median age is  and a half

  
Most of the authors are between  and 

  
and most are teenage girls

  
 percent identify as female

  
and interestingly

  
more fanfiction authors identify
as gender nonconforming than male

  
Authors we interviewed
told us they wrote fan fiction

  
because they love
the characters and worlds

  
And over and over again

  
they told us how much
they learned about writing

  
from participating in these communities

  
Here’s an example

  
One author told us she started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
when she had this intense crush
on a fictional character

  
(Sighs)

  
It led her to write fanfiction
with phrases like

  
“gorgeous cerulean orbs” or

  
(Laughter)

  
“manly hunks of muscle”

  
(Laughter)

  
Kind of embarrassing

  
(Laughter)

  
And she told us

  
“But reviewers were kind enough

  
to be positive about
my amateurish fangirl postings

  
mostly because they also
like this character

  
But they also pointed out
my uses of clichés and overwriting

  
As a result I learned to be sensitive
to these types of bad writing

  
Today I publish original fiction

  
and no one has ever called me out
on a florid writing style”

  
She concluded with

  
“I think if a teacher had simply
redpencilied my childish scribbles

  
I might have been so discouraged
as to never write again”

  
Another author

  
who later became our student

  
told us that she learned about spelling
and grammar while writing fan fiction

  
But she also told us

  
“When I started writing
fanfiction at age 

  
I was a queer autistic middleschooler

  
who hadn’t yet realized
I was either of these things

  
I had difficulty with social situations

  
Fanfiction communities
were a vital social and learning outlet”

  
Today she’s done something
that few undergraduates ever have

  
She’s published a first author
academic paper in a toprated venue

  
(Applause)

  
After studying many individual
writers’ stories over time

  
we came to see that these personal stories
were consistent with the data

  
The young writers’ use of words
grew more diverse

  
as they received more reviews

  
So how did these kids learn

  
and from whom

  
To find out

  
we did a deeper dive into mentoring
in fanfiction communities

  
Now we expected to find traditional
mentormentee pairs

  
older or more experienced authors
mentoring younger

  
or less experienced ones

  
But what we found
was completely different

  
We found millions of authors
and readers communicating

  
via multiple channels

  
and reviewing each other’s work

  
regardless of experience level

  
People of all ages listening to
and reviewing each other’s stories

  
This was so cool we had to give it a name

  
so we call it “distributed mentoring”

  
You can also think of it
as nanomentoring

  
Each piece of mentoring
is tiny on its own

  
but the combination of all of it
is much greater than the sum of its parts

  
A key attribute of distributed
mentoring is its abundance

  
One author we interviewed

  
who wrote both traditionally
published fiction and fan fiction

  
told us that she received
more feedback in a single week

  
on her fanfiction

  
than she did in two years
on her published novel

  
It’s a difference not only of degree

  
but also of kind

  
By itself a single comment
on a story such as “loved it”

  
is relatively meaningless

  
but hundreds or thousands
provide valuable feedback

  
Like 

  
“I like the ambiguity of your ending 

  
it leaves me feeling hopeful”

  
and others like these

  
Reviewers build on
and reference each other’s comments

  
This enables authors to piece together

  
an overall view of their writing
that’s supportive as well as constructive

  
We found only one percent of comments
constituted bullying

  
And these are anonymous

  
This is a surprisingly low number

  
as anybody who has read comments
on an internet platform knows

  
What’s more

  
we found the supportive nature
of most of these comments was critical

  
in writing development

  
One author who was Black

  
made all the characters
from a popular TV show Black

  
She got comments filled
with readers’ sense of freedom

  
and delight from reading her story

  
It not only encouraged her
to keep writing

  
it gave her the conviction
that what she was doing was worthwhile

  
And so through this research

  
Katie and I found ourselves

  
not only believing
that yes kids can be good writers

  
but also that fanfiction

  
and distributed mentoring
could be used in formal education

  
A report from the National Assessment
of Educational Progress

  
found that a whopping
 percent of US students

  
in grades eight and 
lack proficiency in writing

  
Research has shown
that adolescence is a wonderful time

  
to improve your writing skills

  
and the popularity of fanfiction
in this age group shows

  
what an opportunity there is
to use it as a learning tool

  
So here's how I'm imagining it

  
Students with similar interests
from school districts across the country

  
could be connected with one another
to get and give anonymous feedback

  
on their writing

  
It must be anonymous

  
I know this from personal experience

  
Teachers could moderate the channels
to make sure feedback was constructive

  
as well as helping students learn from it

  
If this work grew burdensome for teachers

  
hierarchical moderation could help

  
which is a system where members
themselves can report negative

  
or abusive comments

  
and volunteer moderators
from among the students could decide

  
which ones to delete

  
with teachers weighing in
only when necessary

  
This technique is used
in many large online communities

  
and lots of adolescents
are familiar with it

  
Fanfiction is a private universe
that’s become a welcoming community

  
particularly for those
from marginalized groups

  
This vast and vibrant resource

  
for kids who have something to say

  
is especially meaningful to me

  
when I contrast it
with the isolation I encountered

  
growing up Latina in the US

  
And sometimes

  
I wonder what would have been
different in my own life

  
and maybe in many other people’s lives

  
if only we could have access
to this supportive community

  
of millions of young people

  
and their distributing mentoring

  
as kids

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
The last time I addressed
this august TED crowd was in 

  
from the main stage in Vancouver

  
where I was giving my first TED Talk
on the case for having children

  
And that's where I shared the news
I had just received earlier in the week

  
that my then twoyearold
daughter Nusayba

  
was diagnosed with stage IV cancer
and needed a full liver transplant

  
So how have your past three years been

  
As you can imagine

  
our last three years have been eventful

  
However they have given me some tough

  
learned lived experiences and lessons

  
about this ephemeral thing we call hope

  
And apparently there is a huge demand
for hope right now

  
In 

  
we're all dealing with multiple crises

  
A pandemic has killed  Americans

  
there's a partial lockdown
there's disinformation

  
there's income inequality

  
the rise of white supremacy
people telling people like me

  
“Go back to where you came from”

  
We have to learn new Greek letters
every few months

  
and oh yeah there's climate change

  
But other than that
things are pretty peachy

  
And with all of that you might be asking

  
“Well then why should we be hopeful
in such hopeless times Wajahat”

  
And that is a very valid question

  
And it's a perfectly fair question

  
But hope is what allowed me to believe
that my daughter would somehow survive

  
And she did

  
And so if I may allow me to share briefly

  
three pieces of advice or lessons

  
or things that we can do

  
that gave me hope in hopeless times

  
and that I hope can help you

  
Number one

  
Tie your camel first

  
There's a great saying in Islam

  
many Muslims know this

  
that have faith in God
but tie your camel first

  
As a dad

  
I felt utterly hopeless
with Nusayba's cancer

  
I'm the dad I'm supposed to fix things

  
But I couldn't fix cancer

  
Cancer plays for all the marbles

  
It's a relentless brutal
remorseless killing machine

  
It does not care
about your vacation plans

  
It does not care about your bucket list

  
It does not care about your Netflix queue

  
It comes for everything

  
Then coronavirus

  
Awesome

  
How do I defeat coronavirus

  
A yearold middleaged
slightly overweight male with flat foot

  
It's easy to feel helpless

  
out of control adrift

  
But at the end of the day

  
try letting go of what you can't control

  
and just focus on what you can control

  
The simple stuff

  
Wear a mask

  
Get vaccinated

  
Take care of your daily chores

  
Something that makes you feel
that you have some control

  
some agency in this world

  
When it came to Nusayba

  
that meant as a dad
just to be present you know

  
building her her Lego Friends set
when she asked me to build it

  
Watching "Frozen"  times

  
then followed by "Zootopia"  times

  
then followed by "Moana"  times

  
Getting her the tasty frozen yogurt
from the hospital vending machine

  
that she loved

  
Do what you can the best you can

  
Have hope but tie your camel first

  
And then be like Elsa from "Frozen"

  
and let the rest go

  
Number two

  
invest in joy

  
Make the intention to actively invest
in this thing called joy every day

  
Almost like a workout

  
You have to commit to it

  
It has to be a discipline

  
Build and flex that muscle

  
The world does not need
more masochists or martyrs

  
It does not need more overworked
overstressed burnouts

  
New rule for 

  
You deserve to have moments of joy
even if they are fleeting

  
every day that you are alive

  
And you have to take those moments

  
you have to grab them
you have to seize them

  
I love food

  
so I learned how to cook Pakistani food

  
took my mom's recipes during lockdown

  
My kids love Lego
so that means now I love Lego

  
I love drinking chai

  
I make a cup of chai every day
it makes me happy

  
No matter how much stress or pain
or misery I was going through

  
I made sure to invest time every day

  
to invest in things and people

  
and experiences that gave me joy

  
And finally number three

  
I would recommend humbly
invest in the narrative of hope

  
because the alternative
is apathy and cynicism

  
Investing in hope is painful

  
It means opening yourself up
to the possibility of pain

  
betrayal and disappointment

  
It's easier to court cynicism right

  
You expect nothing so you lose nothing

  
But it also means you have resigned
yourself to the cheap seats

  
You are a spectator who yells out "Boo"

  
instead of being a participant in the ring
where your nose could get bloody

  
but at least you're pushing
the ball forward

  
It means choosing apathy and nihilism
which is comforting and easy

  
but also lazy and destructive

  
During Nusayba's cancer

  
I used to sit up every night
after my family went to sleep

  
and I stayed up till like
three or four am I couldn't sleep

  
And instead I imagined

  
like Doctor Strange
in "Avengers Endgame"

  
with the time stone

  
every possible scenario and outcome
just to prepare myself as a father

  
I had to emotionally prepare
for every outcome

  
So I used to imagine Nusayba dying

  
I imagined burying her with my own hands

  
I imagined making the phone call
to her grandparents

  
explaining that she had died
listening to them cry

  
I imagined living the rest of my life
like a shell of a man

  
but pretending to put a smile on my face

  
because I had a son to raise
and now a daughter

  
My wife badass that she is

  
was also pregnant
during Nusayba's cancer

  
I had to be prepared

  
But I also chose to invest in a narrative
in which Nusayba lived

  
And I imagined seeing her alive

  
with a liver transplant smiling

  
regaining her hair full of joy and life

  
I preferred that story

  
That's the story I invested in

  
even as we were sitting on the edge
of what seemed like a falling cliff

  
I decided I would put out the lawn chair
and at least enjoy the scenery

  
Over  people mostly strangers

  
chose to sign up
to be donors for Nusayba

  
even people who told me
they hated me for my politics

  
They were moved by her story

  
Sometimes some people can change

  
Sometimes some people
can choose to do and be good

  
An anonymous donor Shawn Zahir

  
decided to give a piece of his liver
to a girl he never met

  
just so she could live

  
I'm not Pollyanna

  
I'm not a foolish
wideeyed naive optimist

  
I'm a pragmatist

  
fully aware of the many challenges
and horrors we are facing

  
But through my own personal experience
if it is at all helpful

  
I can assure you that walking
through this forest of horrors

  
going on this journey
wherever it may lead

  
if you choose to invest in hope

  
it at least makes the ride
a bit sweeter and easier

  
And as the wise ram tells Po
in “Kung Fu Panda ”

  
"Your story may not have
such a happy beginning

  
but that does not make you who you are

  
It is the rest of it

  
who you choose to be"

  
Right now

  
survival is victory in this story
that we are living

  
We are alive during a pandemic

  
We are winning

  
And just for that we should be grateful

  
And I hope the choices we make
in these challenging times will

  
Inshallah God willing

  
lead to a better story for all of us

  
And I believe that begins
with choosing to invest in hope

  
during hopeless times

  
Whitney Pennigton Rogers
Thanks so much for that

  
It was really wonderful to hear

  
and I think we may even hear
Nusayba in the background

  
which is I think exciting

  
WA I'm sorry that's her
it's virtual school

  
I'm doing the best I can

  
The wildlings are right there

  
What's keeping us from the wildlings
is a very thin wall so let's pray

  
WPR I think we talked
about this before we started

  
that we're all at home right now

  
That's the thing I think we all know

  
So that's what it is

  
I think before we dive into just
talking more about what you've suggested

  
around growing hope

  
I'd love to start by talking
a little bit about your book

  
"Go Back to Where You Came From"

  
because I think that it
will provide a nice foundation

  
for sort of understanding
your thinking around this

  
and sort of how you've come
to really embrace this

  
So I guess maybe you could start first
by talking about the title of the book

  
You know it's part memoir
part historical analysis

  
part howto guide on being inclusive
and creating a place of belonging

  
How did you come up with the title

  
Why did you choose this
for the title of your book

  
WA So the title is “Go Back
to Where You Came From

  
And Other Helpful Recommendations
on How to Become American”

  
Very deliberate tongue in cheek
both ugly and funny right

  
Because I believe that's the lived
experience of life

  
But that's the lived experience
of many Americans

  
who are still trying to love a country
that doesn't love us back

  
And so how do you respond to that pain

  
And some people cry
as you can tell I laugh

  
And so this book is also an elegy

  
for the rest of us

  
who are still striving
to be coprotagonists

  
of this American narrative

  
And the book tries to expand
and stretch this country

  
to accommodate all of us

  
to become the multiracial
democracy it has to become

  
Or else I believe it'll all fail

  
And it's done with a lot
of humor and hope

  
and throughout the journey
you read the book

  
you know I talk about Nusayba's cancer

  
but there's lots of interesting
things that happen to me

  
WPR To put it mildly

  
WA Yeah my life is like a telenovela

  
like a Mexican soap opera
for better and for worse

  
And so I hope that when you get
to the end part

  
where I talk about "invest in hope
but tie your camel first"

  
the hope that I give
the audience for the future

  
I don't want it to make it a hallmarky

  
fake saccharine Hollywood ending

  
I want you to really like
I want it to be earned

  
And you know the way to earn it
is to confront the horrors

  
confront the challenges name it own it

  
Talk about the pain
wear the mileage and the scars

  
But despite all of that
you still persist right

  
And because I agree I mean

  
what I said in the speech
the fiveminute talk that I just gave you

  
I believe in it

  
I've been on all the sides
in moments of deep despair

  
I've been there of darkness of pain

  
and I realize if you tap out it's over

  
If you tap out it's done

  
And what I've seen

  
and we'll probably talk about it
because you read the book

  
in those moments in my life
where you feel like it's over it's done

  
I'm at the edge of the cliff
and I'm about to fall

  
there's been a plot twist

  
Like the the page turns

  
and with it comes like a better story

  
And so in the book
I mention there was a time

  
where I was completely broke homeless

  
my parents were in jail
I was taking care of my grandparents

  
And I’m like there’s no way
I couldn’t even imagine my future

  
I couldn't imagine
living to the age of 

  
I thought I would be dead by 

  
I’m being honest
with anyone who’s listening

  
My timeline you know I imagine a lot
like I said like Doctor Strange

  
it ended at 
I just couldn't imagine it

  
And I just knew that I would die

  
It’d be over and I almost did die

  
But here I am sitting in my home

  
married to a woman
who's way better than me

  
I married way up

  
Like hotter than me smarter than me

  
like it’s ridiculous not even cool

  
And then I got three kids
and then Nusayba who was supposed to die

  
that’s what they told me
she wouldn’t make it

  
They said every complication
against this girl is happening

  
you could just hear her
chirping right now

  
I'm sure you guys can hear her
chirping that's Nusayba

  
So you never know you never know

  
WPR We have a question
that came in from Darcy

  
where Darcy asked "The idea
of investing in hope is a great one

  
But how can we make it tangible

  
You mentioned visualization
or avoiding complaining

  
but how else can we actually
bring this to life"

  
WA It's a very good question

  
and that's where I say
tie your camel first

  
You have to exhaust yourself
of every possibility within your control

  
You know and after that
you have to let go

  
I'll give you an example
I mention it in the book

  
There was a moment
my parents were in jail

  
I'm  years old I have to leave school

  
I'm taking care of my grandparents

  
my grandmothers who used to live with me

  
I'm an only child

  
I have to care of the family business

  
I have to pay the lawyer

  
It's post/ my community
turns vicious and cruel

  
Bad news travels fast
ladies and gentlemen

  
bad news travels fast

  
I'm surgical with my budget

  
I have an Excel sheet

  
I've got to pay all the bills

  
According to my Excel sheet

  
after I withdrew the  dollars
from Wells Fargo

  
on the corner of Warm Springs and Mission

  
I was supposed to have  dollars left

  
I go to the ATM of Wells Fargo

  
I take out the  bucks
I get the receipt

  
I look at the bottom
instead of  dollars

  
it was 

  
I had  dollars 

  
I had to pay the bills pay the lawyer

  
take care of my family

  
And I swear to you at that time 

  
I mean honestly I said
“I have done everything in my power

  
I am exhausted

  
What can I do with three cents”

  
I didn't even get angry
I didn't get upset

  
I remember this vividly
it was a beautiful Bay Area day

  
anyone who lives there knows
pm little bit of a windy breeze

  
The sun was still there
it was just idyllic

  
And I remember I started laughing
look at the receipt

  
and a couple of people behind me

  
were trying to figure out
what’s wrong with this guy

  
Because I didn’t know what to do
I just chuckled I had three cents left

  
So this is what I did

  
I took the  dollars went across
the street and decided to splurge

  
I went to Subway

  
and had a Subway supersized meal

  
footlong tuna sandwich
with all the workings and avocado

  
And then I decided to have
two chocolate chip cookies

  
Then I went next door and had 
what is a Venti

  
What's the largest one at Starbucks

  
WPR I think Venti I don't drink coffee

  
WA Venti caramel frappe
with extra caramel drizzle right

  
And I had now  dollars
became  dollars

  
I went home and I told my grandmother

  
I said "I've done
everything I possibly could

  
There's nothing else I can do

  
We have  bucks left I'm sorry"

  
I had some Dal Chawal that night
watched a Netflix movie

  
And I remember I said this
in the book I let go

  
There's nothing else I could do

  
I completely let go

  
I said Allah whatever happens
Inshallah I leave it up to you

  
I've done everything within my powers

  
like everything I could possibly
think of I've done

  
This is it like
you want to save me save me

  
you don't want to save me whatever
I enjoyed my Subway meal

  
And I remember
this is really interesting

  
I had the best night's sleep that night
that I have ever had in my life

  
I remember that sleep to this day

  
I have prayed for that sleep

  
I felt like I was a baby
in my mother's womb

  
I tried to wonder why

  
It's because I knew that I did
everything within my powers

  
I exhausted myself and I let it go

  
And then what happened

  
somehow I got a loan
and  bucks came

  
And the story continued

  
And so when you're saying
about doing something tangible

  
it's not just me saying that like

  
you have to have some feeling
of control and autonomy

  
in what is a world where you feel adrift

  
and the ground is shifting
beneath your feet

  
Those small chores
that you take for granted

  
they'll give you order some discipline

  
I’m making that chai I’m painting this

  
I’m feeding my children
I took out the trash

  
I did some work today

  
I can control this
I did this with my hands

  
I'm still alive right

  
And then you plot
and you do the best you can

  
and then you let go

  
And I think those daily chores
that daily routine that you establish

  
gives you a sense of rhythm

  
at the very least says

  
"The world can take everything
but it won't take this

  
It won't take my delicious cup of chai
that I made with my own hands

  
It won't take this little plant
I plotted outside

  
It won't take my love for my kids

  
It won't take that from me

  
Not today death not today"

  
So I hope for whoever asked that question
I hope that was hopeful

The moon goddess Ix Chel patiently
watched a spider at work

  
She could make use of it skills 
she thought

  
Through careful observation and imitation
she soon became a skilled weaver

  
The sun god Kinich Ahau 
was impressed with her work

  
and admired her from afar

  
But the goddess’ grandfather
was very possessive

  
and would not let the sun god 
anywhere near his beloved granddaughter

  
To get past the grandfather
the sun god disguised himself

  
as a hummingbird

  
As he took a drink 
of tobacco flower honey

  
the moon goddess spotted him 
and asked her grandfather

  
to capture the bird for her

  
The grandfather shot the disguised sun god
with a blow dart stunning him

  
Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird 
back to health

  
and soon he was able to spread his wings
and fly again

  
He transformed back into the sun god
and invited the moon goddess

  
to escape with him

  
The two rowed away in a canoe

  
but the grandfather called 
upon the powerful storm god

  
to help him stop them

  
Sensing danger the moon goddess jumped
from the canoe into the water below

  
and transformed into a crab

  
But the storm god had already
thrown a lightning bolt

  
which hit the crab and pierced her
through her heart killing her

  
Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies
gathered

  
buzzing songs and fluttering 
their transparent wings

  
They formed a thick magical cloud 
over the moon goddess’ body

  
For thirteen days the dragonflies cut 
cleaned and hollowed thirteen logs

  
On the thirteenth night 
the logs burst open

  
and the moon goddess emerged—
alive and more brilliant than ever

  
The sun god wasted no time
in proposing marriage

  
The moon goddess happily agreed

  
Sidebyside they were ready to light 
up the sky with their powerful rays

  
Unfortunately the story 
doesn’t end there

  
The sun god’s brother visited often

  
Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel 
the sun god grew jealous

  
and began to mistreat her

  
One day Ix Chel was sitting 
on the riverbank

  
furious at her husband

  
A huge bird came gliding down

  
and offered to take her
to the high mountain peaks

  
To get away from the cruel sun god
she agreed

  
There she met the king of the vultures

  
The vulture king was kind and funloving—

  
a much better partner
than the violent sun god

  
The moon goddess made a new home
with him in the mountains

  
When the sun god heard he was distraught

  
He hid inside a deer carcass
until a hungry vulture came swooping down

  
then hopped onto its back 
and rode to the mountain kingdom

  
where the moon goddess now lived
with the vulture king

  
He begged her to come home with him
apologizing for how he had treated her

  
The kind and forgiving goddess 
took pity on him and agreed to go back

  
But Kinich Ahau soon began 
to show his true nature again

  
He struck her scarring her face
and dimming her bright rays

  
Ix Chel flew off into the dark

  
From then on she vowed 
to appear only at night

  
She befriended the stars and combined
her pale blue rays with their light

  
to guide night travelers to safety

  
She used her healing gift

  
which she had once used 
on the wounded sun god

  
to cure people who were ill

  
Today Ix Chel is so widely known

  
that she’s become 
a symbol of Maya culture

  
But archeological evidence suggests
that for the ancient Maya

  
Ix Chel and the moon goddess 
were separate deities

  
In the retellings of Maya people 
and the records of anthropologists

  
the two have merged 
so that Ix Chel’s story extends

  
beyond the limits 
of the historical record

  
Her story like all myths 
isn’t just one story

  
the variations ancient and modern
speak to what people value

  
and how they see themselves 
in their mythological heroes

  
So I come from Bosnia

  
I mean I live in Sweden now

  
but you don't need to know
my whole life story

  
But the story that I do want to share
is from my home country

  
So close to  percent
of the land in Bosnia

  
is dedicated to agriculture and farming

  
So the government
decides to support farmers

  
to set up a budget

  
to set up the requirements
for the people to receive the budget

  
and then to disburse the funds

  
So they do that and towards
the end of the process

  
they decide to analyze
who really received these funds

  
And they did that

  
and the Ministry
of Agriculture was shocked

  
because only one group of citizens
received  percent of these funds

  
And those were men
men working in agriculture

  
So where were the women

  
Why didn't they have access to the funds

  
The Minister of Agriculture was surprised
because they didn't mean to discriminate

  
They knew there were women
working in agriculture right

  
So they went back
and analyzed the situation

  
And the problem was 
well there were three things

  
The first thing is they didn't even know
the gender of farmers

  
because they'd never done
gender analysis before

  
So actually they did know
the sex disaggregation of cows

  
but not of people

  
(Laughter)

  
I will let that sink a bit 

  
because gender is unimportant

  
The second issue is that the way
they were distributing the funds

  
could not possibly reach women

  
Why Because one of the conditions
to get this subsidy

  
was to give out
a land ownership certificate

  
and we know that traditionally
women do not own land

  
And the second problem
was that women didn't even know

  
Why Because the information was shared
at forums that they do not participate in

  
But the story has a happy end
because when the ministry realized this

  
they changed these provisions

  
And with the help
of gender experts from Bosnia

  
we now see more and more women
getting funds every year

  
So what is the point of this story

  
The point is not only that we should have
sexdisaggregated data on people

  
not only cows

  
(Laughter)

  
But it's also that we can budget
fair and equitably

  
but we can't just run numbers blindly

  
We need to know the faces of the people
that we are serving with public funds

  
So this is really the heart
of genderresponsive budgeting

  
or as I like to think of it
and maybe you too

  
commonsense budgeting

  
(Laughter)

  
So I'm an economist

  
I work with public finance
so public finance and budgets

  
but my specialty is helping governments
inject a gender perspective

  
in their financial decisions and budgets

  
OK so budgets are fairly simple
straightforward

  
as it was introduced

  
and now you are thinking

  
"Well that does not look
fairly straightforward"

  
And it's intentionally done like that

  
because this is how we often imagine
the budget to be so complex

  
so technocratic bureaucratic
we don't even want to engage

  
But the reality
is very different than that

  
In fact all our budgets

  
be it your own budgets
or public budgets or company budgets

  
go through the four logical steps

  
The first step is of course
we are calculating our revenues

  
In the sense of the state
it would be taxes and fees right

  
The second step is budget approval

  
After we figure out
what we will do with the funds

  
it goes to the approval of the parliament

  
And then the third step
my personal favorite

  
is spending or budget execution

  
Ideally according to priorities 
not my personal favorite

  
And then we go into control
and budget oversight

  
So whether we have actually spent
the money as we planned

  
and also whether we have
achieved the objectives

  
So in the sense of the state

  
it would be an increased
level of education

  
decreased level of poverty

  
In the sense of the companies
it would be profit or income

  
You see where I'm going

  
So what is really wrong with that

  
It sounds perfectly logical

  
Well what is wrong with that

  
is that traditionally in most countries
if not all around the world

  
we assume when we are planning
the budget funds

  
that we are targeting one universal
homogenous human

  
that will have the same access to funds
the same needs almost

  
And then a situation such as this one
in the Ministry of Agriculture happens;

  
then we are surprised that our funds
didn't really reach everybody

  
So what I want to also say here
what do we then do about that

  
In Ukraine the government has analyzed
close to  budget programs

  
And when I say “budget programs”

  
these are expenditures
in health education sports

  
infrastructure defense 

  
anything you can think of
that is funded with public funds

  
And in every single one of these programs
we have found gender gaps

  
We have found big gender gaps

  
And these gender gaps
were usually on account of women 

  
they didn't have access

  
And why did this happen

  
It happened because finance officers
were just doing their jobs

  
and they were doing it really well

  
They were planning for economic
effectiveness efficiency

  
value for money 

  
We really love value for money

  
Performance budgeting mediumterm 

  
all of these very valid
economic objectives

  
very valid goals

  
but we really didn't account
for the needs of the people

  
that we are serving with these funds

  
And let me illustrate that

  
So we have analyzed
the program for tuberculosis

  
So treatment of patients
with tuberculosis

  
And you may be now asking

  
"OK but you know
you need to treat the patient

  
Why is gender important here"

  
But when we have done the analysis

  
we have actually seen that  percent

  
of the patients
with tuberculosis were men

  
And tuberculosis
is a big issue in Ukraine

  
And these were men living in remote areas
in rural areas working in mines

  
However the preventive measures
and the way they were designed

  
they didn't account for it

  
They were actually targeting
those sectors

  
such as education and health

  
where women traditionally dominate

  
And this is fine

  
but they really didn’t account
for the needs of the men in these groups

  
And why

  
Because gender equality was not important
in the budget decision

  
So what I'm trying to illustrate here

  
is not only that we need
to account for gender equality

  
to achieve our objectives of equality

  
but we also need to account for it to make
more commonsense budgetary decisions

  
more effective and efficient budgets

  
So how do we do that

  
It looks equally entertaining

  
but now we also add gender

  
so it's a total mess and we would think
"How do we even go about that"

  
But of course
it's not as complex as that

  
because in the heart of this work
is gender analysis

  
And what do I mean by that

  
So when we are planning
as finance officers

  
any financial or fiscal decision

  
meaning when we are planning
introducing a new tax for example

  
the core is to analyze
how will that influence

  
different groups in a society

  
So will we have
our gender gaps increased 

  
we don’t want to do that 

  
reduced or leave the status quo

  
So of course we want to reduce them

  
and I just want to put it here as well

  
in most countries 
not all unfortunately

  
but in a lot of countries
around the world

  
we have a very solid legislative framework
for gender equality

  
We have commitments

  
But when it comes to budget and finance

  
that's where suddenly
the story evaporates

  
So when it comes to money

  
it's not really analyzed
for gender impact

  
So this is really important

  
and we do this in as I said three steps

  
I will take you very fast
through these steps don't worry

  
So the first step is really
to do a situation analysis

  
So in our agriculture example

  
if we had done a situation analysis

  
and if we had known
the gender gaps in this sector

  
we wouldn't have been surprised

  
We would have known
that women do not own land

  
so we wouldn't give this as a requirement

  
and we would definitely have known
that we need to inform them

  
in a different way

  
So this is the first step

  
The second step is related to my example
with sex disaggregation

  
you will remember from the beginning

  
So we really need to know
the beneficiaries

  
that we are trying to serve

  
And now you are thinking
"This sounds very obvious"

  
but it's not done

  
And the third step of course
is to know the procedures

  
How will we give this budget out
who will have access

  
What will be the excluded groups

  
And that's it

  
And now I will just share
some good news I think

  
It's that around  countries
around the world

  
are working with gender budgeting

  
And please if you have an interest

  
just see if your own country
is one of them

  
But when I say they are working
with gender budgeting

  
that does not mean that their whole budget
is genderresponsive

  
That would be my dream

  
But my personal hero is Austria Why

  
Because they have gender budgeting
entrenched in the constitution

  
So that means that in Austria

  
it cannot happen that you have
an investment project

  
that you are doing
without considering gender

  
and gender equality

  
Canada  feminist government
genderbalanced cabinet 

  
and they are doing gender budgeting

  
but they are taking into account
the needs of Indigenous groups of people

  
So this is also something
that we want to do

  
and we have to do

  
Let me take you to Morocco

  
Morocco is working with gender
budgeting for  years

  
Indonesia with the help
of the World Bank

  
has just analyzed
their whole budget system

  
to make it more genderresponsive

  
And I need to take you again to Bosnia

  
because I did start with that example

  
Balkan countries are doing fantastic work
with the help of UN Women

  
So there is a lot of work happening

  
and I am now coming to an end

  
because you might now be wondering

  
"OK but what is in it
for me" in a sense

  
"You are talking about public budgets

  
but I work in a company or NGO
or I'm selfemployed" doesn't matter

  
So what is it Why is it important for us

  
Because this is our money

  
These are our budgets

  
We are filling these budgets 

  
it's not some abstract money out there

  
so we have the right to demand it
to be equitable to be fair

  
That's one thing

  
So it is important for countries
it's important for companies

  
Of course we should ask
who is making decisions

  
whose needs are being satisfied

  
And also maybe families

  
But who really has the voice
who is making decisions

  
It's interesting just to see
and then to maybe be surprised

  
that these ministries are not

  
So if you are interested
you are literally one click away 

  
and I'm aware this sounds
like a sales pitch

  
but I am selling you the work of many
many genderbudgeting experts

  
around the world

  
who have been for years
working with these concepts

  
So you have such a wealth of material

  
from UN Women IMF different scholars

  
World Bank Swedish government 

  
doesn’t matter I will not go
into all the wealth of materials

  
So it's all out there

  
And if we do that
we will have the budgets

  
that will not only lead
to gender equality

  
which is an amazing objective in itself

  
but we will have better more effective
more efficient more fair budgets

  
What's not to like

  
So I hope next time we meet
maybe here again

  
this type of genderresponsive budgeting
will be called "budgeting"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
So when I was born on September  

  
my grandparents and great
grandparents back in India

  
didn't find out for two weeks

  
which is a shame because I mean
look how perfect I was

  
(Laughter)

  
And it's not because the phone
lines were down

  
or because they weren't available

  
It's because there was
a complication with my birth

  
And that complication
was being assigned female at birth

  
You see because my mom had been told
that if she gave birth to a daughter

  
it wasn't worth phoning home about

  
After all she’d already given birth
to my older sister

  
and this time everyone had high hopes
that she would do right and have a son

  
But she didn't

  
She had me

  
And so there were no congratulations
or Indian sweets sent our way

  
Just the reality that from the moment
I came into this world

  
I was already a disappointment
to so many people

  
It's as if they had a time machine

  
and already knew the trajectory
of my entire career and life

  
and decided that I had less to offer

  
And it sucked

  
So why am I telling you this heavy story

  
I'm supposed to be a funny person

  
I have the nerve to come out here
and hit you right in the feels

  
How dare I

  
I'm telling you this because although
this is my lived experience

  
it's also the reality
that millions of girls face every day

  
across every culture and in every country

  
And I'm telling you this
because being born into this reality

  
set me on a lifetime mission
of trying to prove myself

  
and just feel like I was enough

  
What did I want to be when I grow up

  
I wanted to be treated equally

  
And I'm not alone in this mission

  
In fact us girls
what we desperately want

  
is a seat at the table

  
It's what every motivational poster
Tumblr post Instagram account you follow

  
business card tells us

  
Success is a seat at the table

  
And if they want to be extra spicy

  
they say "If there is no seat
drag your own seat"

  
I'm sure you've heard this right

  
And so my marching orders were clear

  
Get a seat at this coveted table
by any means necessary

  
And that's been the driving force
behind my entire career

  
Now in 

  
I noticed that no one
on YouTube looked like me

  
There was no South Asian woman
who's very loud and uses her hands a lot

  
giving her take on the world

  
There was no me in front of a camera

  
I saw a seat up for grabs

  
So I got to work and I started a channel
under the name “Superwoman”

  
Yeah because although
I’m smart enough to do a TED Talk

  
I'm not smart enough
to understand copyright

  
(Laughter)

  
I taught myself how to write

  
shoot and edit my own content

  
And I worked really hard

  
When I finally got the hang of it

  
I committed to posting
two comedy videos a week

  
And I found success

  
With a backwards snapback on my head

  
I gave my take on relationships
pop culture taboo subjects

  
and most popularly
dressed up like my parents

  
(Laughter)

  
I can't tell you how many times
I forgot to wipe that chest hair off

  
A lot of times

  
(Laughter)

  
Now fast forward to 

  
and I'm on stage in India
announcing my first world tour

  
As fate would have it

  
the day after this monumental milestone

  
I was set to fly to Punjab India

  
to visit my grandfather
for the first time in my adult life

  
And whoo nothing could have prepared me

  
for what was about to happen

  
I vividly remember it

  
I was in the car driving to his house

  
He was standing outside

  
I nervously got out of the car
walked up to him

  
He walked up to me
looked me right in the eyes

  
and he raised his hand

  
and decorated me with a flower garland

  
a gesture fit for people of importance

  
He then proceeded to welcome me
into his home my mom by my side

  
and proceed to show me
all the newspaper clippings he had saved

  
with my name and face on them

  
He said the words he was wrong

  
Words I had never heard
a man say before to me

  
He said that I had done
what no one else could have done

  
and I had made the family name proud

  
Me Lilly the baby born a girl

  
That's right

  
Now in that moment
I truly felt like Superwoman

  
I did

  
You know through my YouTube videos

  
I've amassed almost  million subscribers
and three billion views

  
But more important than all of that

  
I managed to change one view

  
I challenged my grandfather's
entrenched gender beliefs

  
And for the first time in my life
I remember thinking in that moment

  
“Oh I finally got
a seat at the table ”

  
Hello props

  
(Laughter)

  
"  alongside the men in the industry”

  
I felt like that

  
And encouraged
by my grandfather's approval

  
I became more confident in my influence

  
I remember thinking "Oh I'm going
to talk at this table

  
I'm going to join
the dinner conversation"

  
You know a lot of my male mentors
make comments and posts

  
about box office numbers
and salaries and titles

  
and those dollar dollar bills

  
So I thought

  
I'm going to chime in here

  
I learned very quickly
that whenever I spoke of money

  
people got a little uncomfortable

  
Like the time I pointed out the gender gap

  
in the Forbes list for online creators

  
a list I'd previously been on

  
I remember wanting to start
a critical conversation

  
because I saw this article
and I was heartbroken

  
You know the digital space
had always been a place

  
that I thought was without gatekeepers

  
And here it was looking
just like old Hollywood

  
Well let me tell you
the internet was not interested

  
I don't know how it's possible

  
but it literally felt as if Twitter
leaped through my screen

  
and body slammed me onto my desk

  
The message was clear

  
you can be on this list

  
but don't try to start any conversations
about the inequality on this list

  
I have thousands and thousands of videos

  
One of my most disliked videos
is why I’m not in a relationship

  
Yeah

  
A lot of the men at the table
did not like me telling them

  
why I didn't need a boyfriend

  
I quickly learned

  
that there’s an invisible
gatekeeper called culture

  
and the table is smack dab
in the middle of it

  
Now in 

  
I made history with my latenight show

  
“A Little Late with Lilly Singh”

  
Thank you thank you

  
(Applause)

  
There I was Lilly
the baby born a brown girl

  
rubbing elbows or at least time slots

  
with comedy royalty

  
And I got to give a huge shout out to NBC

  
for boldly trying to break
latenight tradition

  
I remember when the show came out

  
I remember all the articles
because they looked practically identical

  
"Bisexual Woman of Color
Gets LateNight Show"

  
I almost legally changed my name
to "bisexual woman of color"

  
because that's what people
called me so often

  
And you know as strange
as that sentiment was I thought OK

  
the silver lining is that we'll finally
get a different perspective in latenight

  
A little bit of melanin a dash of queer

  
a different take on things

  
Let's do this!

  
And I remember thinking

  
"Now oh now I've been invited
to the big table

  
And now things will be different"

  
So I took my seat

  
Now unfortunately

  
the budget wasn't based
on the importance or significance

  
or historic nature of the show

  
It was based on the am
timeslot that we had

  
So to say the budget was small

  
the writing staff even smaller

  
and to do the first season

  
I had to shoot  episodes
of latenight television in three months

  
Audience Whoo

  
LS Whoo is right

  
To put that into perspective

  
that is shooting two
to three episodes a day

  
versus the network standard of one a day

  
maybe two on Thursday

  
We did it all with a writing staff
of about half a dozen writers

  
versus the network standard
that's about double that

  
Words cannot explain
to you how exhausting

  
emotionally and spiritually
challenging that was

  
And I started to feel like

  
"Hm I think this chair's
a little wobbly"

  
Now I think we can all agree

  
that the beauty and magic
of latenight is its timeliness

  
You know that no matter
what's happening in the world

  
you can turn on latenight television
and hear all about it

  
But when you shoot  episodes
in three months

  
you kind of lose that magic

  
I was the only show talking about
hooking up partying cuddling traveling

  
in front of a live audience
during a literal global pandemic

  
Now still I thought

  
if the budget doesn't celebrate
the historicness of the show

  
then the creative can

  
I can bring some much needed
spice to latenight

  
And sometimes I was successful

  
But other times

  
I would receive notes like

  
"Don't be so loud"

  
"Don't be so big"

  
"Don't be so angry smile more"

  
And my all time favorite

  
"Don't overindex
on the South Asian stuff"

  
After all everyone else at the table
who's been sitting there for years

  
people are used to them

  
I might be a little jarring to audiences

  
Now during season two of my show

  
I remember I went into overdrive

  
I found all the loopholes
I did all the necessary jobs

  
to try to make the show more timely

  
And I was excited to

  
And I felt compelled to
because for the first time in history

  
we had a woman not to mention
half South Asian woman

  
become vice president
of the United States

  
Now we witnessed one of the greatest
protests in human history

  
with the farmer protests in India

  
And I was excited to finally give
my take on these things

  
But my take was almost never included

  
in topical media news coverage roundups

  
You know we still got the same voices

  
the same perspectives

  
even though someone
and something different

  
was literally in the next time slot

  
I kept trying to pull up my seat

  
I kept trying to join
the dinner conversation

  
I kept trying to ask
for a more supportive seat

  
But every time I would be told

  
that I should be grateful
to have a seat in the first place

  
After all everyone else
that looks like me

  
is still waiting outside
the restaurant in the cold

  
You know the strange thing
about having a wobbly seat

  
is that you spend so much time
trying to keep it upright

  
that you can never bring
your full self to the table

  
So now why am I telling you all this

  
Well because my therapist
costs  dollars an hour

  
and this is way cheaper

  
(Laughter)

  
But also because I just experienced

  
one of the most notorious boys' clubs ever
in latenight television

  
And I'm here to offer solutions

  
I don't always follow up
a venting session with solutions

  
but when I do it’s a TED Talk

  
(Laughter)

  
That's right

  
(Applause)

  
You see my goal was always
a seat at the table

  
It's what women are conditioned
to believe success is

  
And when the chair doesn't fit

  
when it doesn't reach the table
when it's wobbly

  
when it's full of splinters

  
we don't have the luxury
of fixing it or finding another one

  
But we try anyways

  
We take on that responsibility
and we shoulder that burden

  
Now I've been fortunate enough
to sit at a few seats

  
at a few different tables

  
And what I've learned is
when you get the seat

  
trying to fix the seat
won't fix the problem

  
Why

  
Because the table was never built
for us in the first place

  
The solution

  
Build better tables

  
(Applause)

  
So allow me to be
your very own IKEA manual

  
I would like to present to you
a set of guidelines

  
I very eloquently call

  
“How to Build a Table that Doesn’t Suck”

  
(Laughter)

  
I've been told I'm very literal

  
Now right off the bat let me tell you

  
this assembly is going to take
more than one person

  
or group of people

  
It's going to take everyone

  
Are you ready Should we dive in

  
Let's do it

  
Up first

  
don't weaponize gratitude

  
Now don't get me wrong
gratitude is a great word

  
It's nice it's fluffy
a solid  points in Scrabble

  
However let's be clear

  
Although gratitude feels warm and fuzzy

  
it's not a form of currency

  
Women are assigned  percent more work

  
and spend more time on unrewarded

  
unrecognized and nonpromotable tasks

  
Basically what this means is

  
all the things men don't want to do
are being handed to women

  
and a lot of those things largely include
things that advance inclusivity

  
equity and diversity in the workplace

  
So hear me when I say

  
a woman shouldn't be grateful
to sit at a table

  
She should be paid to sit at a table

  
(Applause)

  
Especially ones she largely helped build

  
And a woman's seat shouldn't be threatened
if she doesn't seem "grateful" enough

  
In other words corporations

  
this step involves a woman doing a job

  
and being paid in money
opportunity and promotion

  
not just gratitude

  
And women  yeah go ahead
live it up live your life

  
(Applause)

  
And women a moment of real talk

  
trust me I've been there
and I know it's so tough

  
but we have to understand
and remember that being grateful

  
and being treated fairly
are not mutually exclusive

  
I can be grateful but still know
exactly what I deserve

  
And that's the way to do it

  
(Applause)

  
Up next invest in potential

  
When investing in women

  
don’t invest in the am time slot

  
Invest in empowering something different

  
Invest in a new voice

  
Give them the support they actually need

  
Cultural change takes time and money

  
Heck it took my grandfather  years
to see that I was worthy of more

  
So a true investment is one
that values potential over proof

  
Because so often that proof
doesn't exist for women

  
Not because we aren't qualified

  
but because we haven't been
given the opportunity

  
In other words

  
if you're trying to be inclusive

  
don't give someone new
a seat made of straw

  
until they prove
they deserve a better one

  
Don't hold something
called a "prove it again" bias

  
which requires less privileged people
to constantly keep proving themselves

  
even though white men tend to get by
on just their potential

  
Give them a seat that they can thrive in

  
that they can do the job
you hired them to do in

  
Allow them to contribute to the table

  
and they will make it better

  
Up next this is my favorite one

  
My favorite one it's quite
common sense actually

  
Make space for us

  
You know for every three men at a table

  
there's only one
place setting for a woman

  
People are so used to more men
showing up that they plan for it

  
There's an extra seat in the corner
there's a steak under the heat lamp

  
When more men show up
the table gets longer

  
But when that extra RSVP is a woman

  
more often than not

  
she's encouraged to compete
against the only other woman

  
that was invited to the table

  
Instead we need to build
multiple seats for multiple women

  
not just one or two

  
so that women are not sitting
on top of each other's laps

  
fighting for one meal

  
We already know that more
diverse teams perform better

  
A recent study shows

  
that corporations that have
more gender diversity

  
on their executive teams

  
were  percent more likely
to experience above average profitability

  
And more racially diverse companies
had  percent more profit

  
So really no matter how you look at it

  
it's time to build
longer tables and more seats

  
And I want to say something

  
and I want to admit something
I want to be vulnerable for a second

  
Because I've fallen victim
to this so many times

  
and women let me know
if you've experienced this

  
We have to get rid of the scarcity mindset
and champion each other

  
you know because I've learned
what's the better win

  
Me sitting at a table

  
or us sitting at a table

  
Don't be convinced to fight for one spot

  
Instead fight for multiple spots

  
(Applause)

  
And let me lead by example
right now and say

  
I know there’s many other women
that are going to come on this stage

  
and I hope they all nail it
and I will be cheering you all on

  
because we can all win

  
And I'm going to be your biggest
cheerleader when you're up here

  
(Applause)

  
Last it's time to upgrade the table talk

  
Now I believe stories
make the world go around

  
You thought it had something
to do the solar system

  
Joke's on you it's stories

  
(Laughs)

  
Stories are how we understand ourselves

  
how we understand others
and how we understand the world

  
And arguably the most important stories
are those we see in the media

  
Because we’ve seen time and time
that they control the narrative

  
and impact culture

  
Now when it comes to genre

  
you can argue that certain genres
have certain target demographics

  
When it comes to the world news
the target demographic is the world

  
and we know half of the world is female

  
Yet women and girls make up only
a quarter of the people interviewed

  
or that the news is even about
in the first place

  
Instead when it comes to issues
that impact women

  
we not only need to be included
in the coverage

  
we need to be driving those stories
and dimensionalizing our own experience

  
Inviting everyone in on the table talk
isn't just a nice gesture

  
It makes for better more productive
smarter conversation

  
with more than one point of view

  
And that's how you get better

  
So this all sounds like a lot of work

  
And it is

  
But I'm going to tell you
why it's necessary and worth it

  
To be honest this is about so much more
than just women in the workplace

  
In fact I could probably come up
with many more guidelines

  
across many other industries

  
This is about creating a world
where half of the population can thrive

  
You see because the work we do today

  
can create a world
where future generations of girls

  
can have equitable access and opportunity

  
And here's the best part
Are you ready for it

  
Everyone listening today
all the men the women

  
everyone in between the big companies
the small ones the media outlets

  
the people that snuck
into the back all of you

  
you can help create this future

  
A future where we have longer tables

  
and more seats that actually work

  
instead of fighting for a seat
at the old ones that don't

  
A future where everyone
is seated at the table equally

  
And a future

  
where being assigned female at birth
is not a disappointment

  
or a disadvantage

  
because girls are encouraged

  
empowered and expected to do great things

  
And I can't wait to make that a reality

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Growing up in a workingclass town
in upstate New York

  
I was taught to hope for a future
with a husband and two kids

  
How about you

  
I saw women in my community
marry as a path to economic security

  
but often end up with discontent
and even abuse instead

  
As I got older

  
I came to wonder and I ask you now

  
What is family

  
What do we want family to be

  
The nuclear family has been the basis
for our cultural stories and our laws

  
But only about half
of US adults are married

  
Fewer every year

  
Forty percent of US adults
don't live with a romantic partner at all

  
As of 

  
less than half of US children
had two married heterosexual parents

  
in their first marriage

  
The majority of us are not in a nuclear
family with a spouse and kids

  
Yet somehow

  
we treat this majority of people
like social failures

  
What’s worse

  
our laws treat unmarried people
as lesser citizens

  
Marriage comes with over  rights
and benefits under federal law

  
These include the ability
to get your spouse citizenship

  
share health insurance
get better tax rates

  
and inherit taxfree at death and more

  
Part of the winning argument
for samesex marriage

  
was that we shouldn't deprive gay couples
of all of these essential benefits

  
But I ask you

  
why should anyone be denied benefits
because they're in a romantic relationship

  
of which some people disapprove

  
Or because they're single

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
Or because they're basing family

  
on something other
than a romantic relationship

  
like coparenting a child

  
Our laws should move away from the idea
that there's one ideal family form

  
and value all families as they exist

  
(Applause)

  
That's what I've dedicated my career to

  
and today I'll share some of my visions

  
for how we can change US laws
to benefit all families

  
but also how an expansive view of family

  
will strengthen all
of your own relationships

  
For nearly  years with my law firm
for LGBTQ and nonnuclear families

  
I've supported same sex couples

  
But also the many family
forms beyond marriage

  
like platonic partners
who are raising a child together

  
or sharing finances
without a romantic relationship

  
Or grandparents who are raising
their grandchildren

  
Or a lesbian couple
coparenting with a male friend

  
Or polyamorous partners

  
who might be in a committed
relationship of three or four

  
Within that legal advocacy

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
and then help them design
their own family agreements

  
With the nonprofit
organization I founded

  
Chosen Family Law Center

  
I advocate for changes in US laws

  
to benefit this whole beautiful spectrum
of family constellations

  
And it is my core belief
that no matter how you form family

  
actively discussing
how we intend to live together

  
is the best thing we can do to strengthen
our own personal relationships

  
So how did we end up with this current
US emphasis on nuclear family

  
Most of us throughout history have lived
in large extended family networks

  
and  percent of the world
population does today

  
The nuclear family is actually
a relatively new development

  
It emerged in the industrial revolution

  
to support a working dad
and a homemaker mom

  
It peaked in the s and 's

  
but it hasn't been the most common
family form before or since

  
Still somehow it's the basis
for our health insurance system

  
How well is that working out

  
And a reason for our lack
of affordable childcare in this country

  
We still build and zone suburban homes
with this fictional family in mind

  
In Western Europe where I live
and in many other countries

  
states provide support
for citizens in need

  
including parents who are home
with young children

  
such as paid maternity leave

  
and financial support throughout
the childhood if needed

  
But in US law

  
we make sure that financial safety net
happens between spouses

  
rather than between citizen and state

  
US marriage is a social
welfare state of two

  
I'd rather a different social
welfare state personally

  
This leaves many people especially women

  
stuck in unhealthy relationships

  
So at this point

  
we can evaluate how samesex partnership

  
when we move into that movement
for same sex marriage

  
there was really an emphasis

  
on whether we should be
pushing for gay marriage

  
so that gay people could get
the benefits of marriage

  
or whether we should be working
to protect the rights of the unmarried

  
And we can do both

  
It's time now to protect
the rights of unmarried people

  
and other kinds of family constellations

  
(Applause)

  
Because the reality is
there's no evidence

  
that the nuclear family model
is actually the best one

  
Research has consistently shown

  
that children need stability
of parental figures

  
But from what I've consistently found

  
it doesn't matter
if that stability is mom and dad

  
two dads mom and grandma

  
or three polyamorous partners

  
So this is not only about justice

  
This is about what's best for children

  
If we really want that stability for kids

  
we need to provide support for all
the kinds of families that kids are in

  
rather than try and fail

  
to push people into a nuclear family model
with government benefits

  
It's time to observe
what's not working and change course

  
My definition of family

  
is people who are committed
to be there for each other

  
no matter what

  
This includes chosen family

  
regardless of biological relationship
or legal marriage

  
Many Black families in the US
have chosen aunties and uncles

  
with no blood relation

  
but a decision to be family
and a commitment to the children involved

  
Countless LGBTQ people
create chosen family

  
when they're rejected
by their family of origin

  
or when wanting to create
families that share their values

  
I am one of those queer people
to find home with chosen family

  
I grew up in a Christian family
in a small town

  
the only child of wonderful older parents

  
When I came out as bisexual

  
then as polyamorous
then as gender nonbinary

  
most of my blood relations
and over  cousins stopped talking to me

  
That's pretty standard

  
When I was a broke something
starting my law practice

  
I was diagnosed with cervical cancer

  
And realized that I'd been duped
into buying a health insurance

  
that didn't cover cancer

  
I was in a desperate
lifethreatening situation

  
And while my parents were loving

  
they couldn't provide me
with material support or problemsolving

  
So I broke through my shame
and my embarrassment

  
about asking for help

  
And I reached out
to my communities of friends

  
And I discovered that they were eager
to more actively support one another

  
They made a schedule

  
so there was always
someone there to cook to clean

  
to make phone calls
about my health coverage

  
or just sit with me while I cried
in my grief and my fear

  
When I won my appeal to receive coverage
by the Cancer Services Medicaid program

  
the administrator called and said

  
"I don't know who you are
but a lot of people love you"

  
(Applause)

  
And then she said "And I'd like them
to stop calling my office now please

  
Let them know you got coverage it's done

  
Thank you"

  
(Laughter)

  
The chosen family who stepped up for me

  
probably saved my life

  
But they wouldn't necessarily be able
to visit me in the hospital

  
or cross a border
in a pandemic to be with me

  
Because relationships beyond blood
and beyond marriage

  
often don't get those rights

  
And since then my life's work
has been to change that and I will

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
When we embrace the idea of chosen family

  
our own free will is more important
than biological connection

  
We can choose to create
family relationships

  
with the people who provide us
with the meaningful support

  
that we need and deserve

  
Samesex parenting has also advanced
the concept of family beyond biology

  
because in a same sex couple

  
only one parent's providing
the sperm or the egg

  
In my familybuilding legal work
with these families

  
I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned

  
before designing that legal agreement

  
For example

  
I’ll often work with a female
samesex couple

  
who has a male friend
who wants to "help" them become parents

  
So I'll facilitate discussions
to make sure they're all clear

  
on whether he's going to be
a coparent or a sperm donor

  
and design a legal agreement either way

  
Without that I've seen
too many situations of ambiguity

  
Where mom calls him a dad
when she needs childcare help

  
but a donor when it comes time
to make a big decision

  
she doesn't want his input on

  
He calls himself dad
when the baby's adorable at the park

  
but feels more like a donor
when the school bill comes you know

  
When we're designing our own families

  
we need clear written agreements

  
especially if children are involved

  
Let's say I have two clients
Sharon and Bill

  
best friends who are considering
becoming coparents

  
Sharon's turned 

  
and hasn't found the right man
with whom to marry and have kids

  
Neither has her gay bestie Bill

  
who can’t afford the $
surrogacy process by himself

  
So they call each other their Plan B

  
I would facilitate discussions with them
about their parenting values

  
their plans to share
finances for the child

  
their ideal week of childcare split

  
But the conversation
often gets more difficult

  
when I ask questions like

  
"Are you willing to live in the same city
for the next  years

  
to each be near the child"

  
We're used to the idea
of sacrificing for a spouse

  
and saying "no" to a dream job
in a different city

  
to stay close to each other

  
But it's a shocking idea
to do that for your buddy

  
But by becoming coparenting partners

  
they need to elevate their level
of commitment from friends

  
to platonic partners

  
They need to consciously say “goodbye”
to a Prince Charming fantasy

  
and welcome and embrace a new reality

  
of a beautiful partnership
grounded in their longterm friendship

  
and agree that this coparenting
relationship will come first

  
I have found in my work

  
that these kinds of discussions
are much more powerful

  
for preventing future disputes
than any written contract can be

  
We need to have these conversations

  
Legal contracts are sometimes written
to avoid looking eye to eye

  
and coming to agreement

  
But family contracts should only
be written after you've done that

  
When I design relationships

  
for polyamorous triads of three
or quads of four

  
I sometimes use existing legal structures

  
like trusts or LLCs

  
that allow you to share
property and finances

  
without a question
as to your relationship

  
So for example if I've got
a polyamorous triad

  
Ayesha Susan and Linda

  
I can set up an LLC for them

  
so that they can coown
real estate properties

  
pay taxes together

  
purchase a common health insurance

  
and have clear
exit strategies if they wish

  
(Applause)

  
And if people trust each other enough

  
to pool their financial fortune
and want to pay taxes together

  
it shouldn't matter
whether they're business partners

  
siblings or romantic partners

  
All of those families are valid

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
We should be able to choose legal partners

  
beyond a single romantic
partner like a spouse

  
Some people are doing that now

  
and it's the trend for the future

  
Domestic partnerships have been used
for  years by samesex couples

  
but also by best friends and siblings

  
Doing so as domestic partners
allows you to share your health insurance

  
to visit each other in the hospital

  
and across borders
in a pandemic like spouses

  
But unlike spouses you don't become
a social welfare state of two

  
which can be a good thing

  
I had a client who had
a severely disabled sister

  
By becoming domestic partners

  
she was able to put her sister

  
on her excellent
health insurance coverage

  
Why would a sister be any less worthy
of that than a boyfriend

  
Right

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
We've built on that history

  
In  my organization
helped pass the first laws

  
for multipartner domestic partnership

  
which have passed
in several cities and counting

  
This means that three
or four polyamorous partners

  
could become domestic partners

  
or two or more platonic coparents

  
or any two three or four people

  
who want to become
each other's legal partners

  
When relationships
have legal status like this

  
it reduces discrimination and promotes
social acceptance and awareness

  
as we saw in the samesex
partnership movement

  
Still we hope this year to pass

  
the first family status
nondiscrimination laws

  
at city levels across the United States

  
which means that you
can't be discriminated against

  
you can't be fired from your job
or denied housing

  
because of your family configuration

  
(Applause)

  
In future

  
I propose that we move from these
citylevel domestic partnerships

  
to statelevel multipartner
domestic partnerships

  
and then federal recognition

  
as we did with samesex marriage

  
And if we really want
to value families as they exist

  
rather than incentivize marriage

  
I also suggest that we separate out
some of the legal perks of marriage

  
so that single people and other kinds
of families get these benefits

  
without an evaluation of whether
they're in a romantic relationship

  
that passes muster

  
And marriage should not be the gateway
to social and economic privilege anymore

  
That time is done

  
And marriages will be stronger
when we do that

  
Do you know anyone who got married
faster than they should have

  
for health insurance or citizenship

  
Because I know too many
and I’m a divorce lawyer

  
(Laughter)

  
As a divorce lawyer
relationships last longer

  
when we marry for better reasons
than government perks

  
So many of you may be married

  
and may not think that these issues
have personal relevance for you

  
But I ask you to reflect

  
Could your relationship be stronger

  
if you adopted a more
expansive view of family

  
Marriage and partnership
are not onesizefitsall

  
Every couple in partnership benefits

  
from actively deciding how they want
to cocreate together

  
in terms of coparenting shared finances

  
your household

  
and your definition of monogamy

  
For example

  
is there any hidden expectation
that you have with your partner

  
that would benefit from being
spoken out loud and confirmed

  
I bet there is

  
Or is there any aspect of partnership
that you participate in

  
just because everyone does it

  
like sleeping in the same bed
or only vacationing together

  
that just isn't really working
for your partnership

  
When we expect any one relationship
in our lives to meet most of our needs

  
we may be putting too much pressure
on that relationship

  
And whether it's your romantic partner
your parent your adult child

  
your relationship may be stronger

  
if you also strengthen
other connections in your lives

  
and find other ways to get
some of your own needs met

  
(Applause)

  
My husband does not want
to help me process

  
I have other people for that in my life

  
So 

  
I think it's worthwhile to question

  
no matter what kind of family
configuration you're in

  
whether you could be part of a movement
for greater interconnectedness

  
beyond our romantic relationships
and beyond the walls of our home

  
Your family and your community
will be stronger when you do

  
Is there a longterm friend
that you could reach out to

  
with whom you'd like to be better in touch

  
and suggest a regular date
for a special time together

  
Could you create a childcare cooperative
with other parents in your community

  
Is there a single parent
or elderly person in your life

  
whose home you could spend more time in

  
At some point in a long life

  
you too will need support

  
And it benefits you
to practice asking for support now

  
and actively caring
for people in community

  
who may one day care for you

  
A baby whose diaper you change
may one day change yours

  
(Audience murmurs and laughs)

  
Sorry

  
It's the beautiful reciprocity
of human relationship

  
And in my vision for the future

  
while we work together
to redefine family in law

  
we can all redefine family
in our own culture and lives

  
There may even be a close friend
to whom you get the courage to ask

  
Do you want to make family with me

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
In the s American industrialist 
Henry Ford had one overwhelming obsession

  
soybeans

  
He extracted their oil to make enamel 
for painting his cars

  
He crushed them into powder
to make plastic parts

  
And he encouraged American farmers 
to grow as much of the plant as possible

  
But he wasn’t just feeding soy 
to machines

  
At the Chicago World’s Fair
he hosted a soycentric feast

  
The ingredient had been a staple
in Asian cuisine for centuries

  
but Ford’s dinner— full of soy substitutes
for dairy meat and wheat—

  
took the integration of soy
into food a step further

  
Today soy is in so many foods 
that most people consume it every day

  
without even knowing it

  
So what makes soybeans so versatile

  
And is our global obsession
healthy or harmful

  
Soybeans have been cultivated in Asia
as early as  years ago

  
but since then they’ve spread 
across the globe

  
Part of soy’s success is that 
the crop can be grown easily and cheaply

  
in variable conditions

  
And once they’re grown

  
soybeans have an incredibly high density
of proteins and fats;

  
ingredients which in recent years
have been used in everything

  
from mayonnaise to biodegradable plastic

  
The ideal method
for separating these components

  
depends on what you’re trying to extract

  
To isolate soy proteins dehulled beans 
are sometimes pressed through rollers

  
to create thin flakes and then steeped 
in water to draw out the proteins

  
Alternatively whole beans can be simply
soaked and ground

  
into a whitish protein rich liquid

  
In both cases the resulting substance 
can be used to make spongy foods

  
like tofu or filtered to produce soymilk

  
And at the industrial scale

  
these proteins can be used in various ways
to help make processed foods

  
Soy fats may be even more versatile

  
In one extraction method

  
soybeans are dried cleaned 
and then fed into an extruder

  
This machine simultaneously heats
and presses the beans

  
producing a liquid containing soy oil
and other fatty components

  
By adding water and spinning the mixture
components are separated into two parts

  
refined soy oil for things like salad
dressing and a substance called lecithin

  
Lecithin is made of molecules
called phospholipids

  
which have a phosphate head that attracts
water and a tail that attracts fats

  
These features make phospholipids
excellent for blending ingredients

  
that naturally separate from each other

  
This process is called emulsification

  
and soy lecithins are used 
as an emulsifying agent

  
in a huge variety of foods

  
For example during chocolate production

  
phospholipids attach to both the fatty
components of the cocoa butter

  
and the watersoluble sugar particles

  
making them easier to combine
into a smooth mixture

  
A similar process happens 
in powdered products

  
that need to be instantly rehydrated

  
Soy lecithin bonds with the water

  
and helps the powder 
disperse more quickly

  
While there are other plants 
we can process for lecithin and proteins

  
soy’s mild taste 
and widespread availability

  
have earned it a place 
in thousands of food products

  
But is it unhealthy to be eating
this much soy

  
Not really

  
Soybeans contain many of the essential
amino acids our bodies need

  
making them one of the best ways 
to get these proteins without eating meat

  
And the beans’ fat content is largely
made up of socalled “good” fats—

  
poly and monounsaturated fatty acids

  
which can decrease cholesterol 
and reduce the risk of heart disease

  
There are some compounds in soy

  
that may inhibit our body’s absorption
of various minerals

  
And about % of the general population
has a soy allergy

  
which can be severe in rare cases

  
But for many people the biggest complaint
about soy consumption

  
is the occasional increase in flatulence

  
Outside our bodies however
soy is much more worrying

  
To accommodate the soy farms needed
for heavy industry

  
processed foods and livestock feed 
huge swaths of land have been deforested

  
Between  and  roughly
 square kilometers of the Amazon

  
were cleared for soy production

  
In some regions this has also led
to the displacement of farmers

  
and indigenous communities

  
So if we want to keep using soy
and all its byproducts

  
we’ll need to find a way 
to do it humanely and sustainably

  
Pasture is the single
largest type of land

  
on the surface of the Earth today

  
thanks to our taste for meat and dairy

  
Just over a quarter of all land
is used for livestock

  
That's more than forests
or farm fields or anything else

  
Most of that land is best for ruminants

  
such as cows

  
that can digest highfiber feed
such as grass and straw

  
However the process by which grass
and fiber is broken up

  
in the stomachs of cows
and other grazing ruminants

  
has a byproduct methane

  
a potent greenhouse gas

  
Despite what you might have heard
about methane and cows

  
most of the methane
is actually burped out

  
not through the back end

  
(Laughter)

  
And that represents
about two billion tons

  
of carbon dioxide equivalent per year

  
or more than four percent of our annual
global greenhouse gas emissions

  
We have a methane problem from cows

  
So how can you reduce these methane burps

  
My colleagues and I
may have found a solution

  
Seaweed!

  
Let me explain

  
A couple of years ago

  
an article was published
by Rob Kinley and colleagues

  
that showed almost complete
elimination of methane

  
when seaweed was added
to chopped grass in the lab

  
Great

  
But as an agricultural researcher

  
I know lots of additives
work well in the lab

  
but not in real animals

  
But there was something
different about seaweed

  
and the way in which it reduced methane

  
So we thought we should
test this in live animals

  
In collaboration with Joan Salwen

  
an entrepreneur

  
and colleagues from
James Cook University and CSIRO

  
we decided to conduct a small experiment

  
to determine the amount of seaweed
we might need to use

  
This was the first ever
experiment in dairy cattle

  
and we had no idea how much to give them

  
So we started with about  grams per day

  
going up to  grams

  
Mind you this was mixed in
with  kilograms of their feed

  
One of the graduate students
I work with Breanna Roque

  
trapped their methane burps

  
(Laughter)

  
In that first experiment

  
the emissions were reduced
by up to  percent

  
(Applause)

  
And I thought at first

  
the equipment must have
malfunctioned but it was real

  
But we are left with more
questions than answers

  
Would the microbes
in the gut get used to it

  
and start producing methane over time

  
Would the seaweed be stable
over a long period of time in storage

  
Would the taste be affected
and the cows turn up their noses

  
Or would the seaweed affect
the cows's health or milk production

  
So we teamed up again
to conduct another trial

  
Over a fivemonth period

  
we saw the seaweed
that was harvested three years prior

  
reduce emissions by over  percent

  
(Applause)

  
Our colleagues in Australia

  
they saw up to  percent
reduction in a similar trial

  
That kind of reduction
is simply staggering

  
And in the graph

  
you see methane emissions
in three levels of intake

  
So the first line
is for cattle with no seaweed

  
The second line is for cows

  
that were supplemented
with about  to  grams of seaweed

  
And the last one is for cows

  
supplemented with
about  to  grams of seaweed

  
As you can see as you increase
the amount of seaweed

  
you see a reduction in methane emissions

  
We have also seen
an improvement in bulking up

  
of the beef cattle
with no adverse health effects

  
So it’s a win for the environment;

  
it's a win for the farmers and consumers

  
A panel of  people got to taste steak

  
made from steers offered
seaweed and control

  
And they did not detect any difference

  
We also did a nutritional
quality of the meat

  
and we found no difference between
animals that were offered seaweed

  
and the control

  
So how does it work

  
Some seaweeds contain ingredients

  
that directly inhibit microbes
in the cow’s gut from forming methane

  
without interfering with food digestion

  
The amount of methane produced

  
is dependent on how much
the animal is eating

  
and what's in the diet

  
And as such

  
previous efforts to reduce
methane emissions

  
focused on changing their diets

  
or improving forage quality

  
And we do have potential solutions
other than seaweed

  
to reduce methane emissions

  
We looked at additives to feed
such as NOPs

  
reduce emissions by about  percent

  
Even garlic and citrus extract

  
can reduce methane burps
by over  percent

  
without affecting
animal health and productivity

  
Now you may ask

  
Why not stop eating
beef and drinking milk

  
Audience member Yeah!

  
(Laughter)

  
EK That would be a good question

  
So adopting a plantbased diet
with supplements

  
may help shrink
a person's carbon footprint

  
in highincome countries like the US

  
But you know a lot of people
are not going to do that

  
And for the rest of the world

  
these foods are needed
to provide key nutrients

  
such as vitamin B and vitamin A

  
which are critical for brain function

  
for vision and immunity

  
These are found almost exclusively
in beef and milk

  
In this graph you see different countries

  
with their annual meat consumption
per capita on the bar graph

  
and then you see the dots
representing the stunting rate

  
in children below the age
of five years old

  
And countries that have lower
consumption of methane

  
are associated with higher
incidence of stunting

  
I know this firsthand

  
Growing up in Eritrea

  
I loved milk and meat
when you could get it

  
which wasn't often

  
Even as a kid I always wondered

  
how a cow eating just grass
produces nutritious milk I love to drink

  
And that wonder pushed me
into a career to understand

  
and improve livestock production

  
so that people in lowincome countries
do not suffer with stunting

  
and other nutrientdeficiency diseases

  
(Applause)

  
So what now

  
We know seaweed can work

  
But the cultivation of the specific
seaweed has been a barrier

  
It's not so easy to farm
asparagopsis taxiformis

  
But there are a number of efforts
going on at the moment

  
to scale up production

  
Blue Ocean Barns is growing
seaweed in Hawaii already

  
and they estimate that there will be
enough production to feed all cattle

  
in the US by 

  
All we need now
is for governments to step up

  
and facilitate the use
of these methanebusting feed additives

  
Cattle industries in some countries

  
have already committed
to climate neutrality by 

  
But if we can get these
feedadditive innovations

  
into cow stomachs earlier

  
we can cut methane burps significantly

  
Given that methane only lasts
in the atmosphere for a decade or so

  
we could even slow global warming
in the short term

  
Yes we have a methane problem from cows

  
but we may have seaweed
and other solutions

  
for these methane burps

  
helping us provide meat and dairy
while maintaining a safe climate

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
If you've gone to a tech conference

  
literally any tech conference
in the last five years

  
you would walk away with the impression
that the connected easytonavigate

  
clean and green smart city
is just around the corner

  
The reality and the hype is

  
that many companies are working
on products and solutions to get there

  
Take transportation for example

  
Allegedly in the city of the future

  
you will be able to seamlessly plan
your journey from public transportation

  
to shared autonomous taxis
and even electric scooters

  
If you own a car it will be electric

  
and there will be charging stations
strategically placed throughout the city

  
So all you do is type
your location into your GPS

  
and it will automatically
take you to your location

  
in the minimum amount of time

  
and any payment you need for charging

  
will be done automatically
in the background

  
Now you might say wait a minute

  
there are companies
that are doing this today

  
I can do this today

  
But it’s individual companies

  
and it's certainly not ubiquitous
across the city

  
But it doesn't just stop
with transportation

  
Let's take health

  
In the future there will be airquality
monitors at every street corner

  
and they will be connected
with your asthma inhaler

  
so that you know when it's safe to go out

  
Or there will be infrared cameras

  
that are measuring the temperature
of citizens anonymously

  
and that will be connected
with your thermometer

  
so that we can detect future outbreaks

  
And of course you will also have
your wearable device

  
that connected to your bathroom scale
and your smart refrigerator

  
so that nutritionists doctors
and other companies

  
can come up with new ways
to keep you you know

  
slim and and trim as I am

  
Then of course there's shopping

  
I mean when you shop today you know

  
you purchase from different retailers

  
and you receive multiple shipments
during the course of the day

  
Now if you had an app
where you could set your preferences

  
and those shipments can be consolidated

  
and maybe you receive
fewer shipments during the week

  
a little bit less convenient

  
but you get to reduce
your carbon footprint

  
So these are all great ideas
and solutions and products

  
that companies are working on

  
but they all share
an underlying requirement

  
that could make that smart city

  
more of a distant dream
than a reality just around the corner

  
And that is the need for greater sharing
of data across companies

  
individuals and cities

  
And if there's one thing
that we've learned

  
is that companies
don't like to share data

  
they don't even like to share
our own data with us

  
So let alone data
with competitors or partners

  
And therein lies the dilemma

  
because if we want to have a chance
at really combating climate change

  
we need to have our cities become
as smart and as connected

  
as quickly as possible
and as many cities as possible

  
So we need to overcome
this fear of data sharing

  
and move towards the smartcity future

  
But why is it that companies
fear sharing data

  
Well it’s what I call “FOMA”

  
Not FOMO

  
the fear of missing out
on a great party or either opportunity

  
but FOMA the fear of missing out
on competitive advantage

  
Data is a source of competitive advantage

  
So why would companies want to give it up

  
In our research over the last two years

  
we've been looking
at many different solutions

  
that would improve the citizen experience

  
and as well sustainability
solutions for cities

  
And what we found is that  percent
of those solutions

  
require much more data sharing

  
across companies individuals and cities

  
So the question really comes

  
how do we motivate companies
to share more of their data

  
We need to actually
overcome this fear quickly

  
if we want to make meaningful
progress on climate change

  
Well as we talked
to a number of companies

  
that were building platforms
and ecosystems in different verticals

  
like logistics transportation

  
smart buildings smart cities

  
we asked about what it would take
to drive greater data sharing

  
across these different solutions

  
And what we heard were the usual concerns

  
data sharing is costly it’s complicated

  
And companies were concerned
about unintended disclosures

  
that could risk their brand

  
However there was one exception

  
And this I think is promising

  
Companies were more willing
to share their data

  
if it could serve a broader common purpose
beyond commercial motivations

  
And in particular

  
they're more willing to share their data
beyond their own four walls

  
if that data sharing could help
fight climate change

  
Let's take for example
a few car companies

  
that actually are fierce competitors

  
and they got together

  
and started to share detailed mapping data

  
so they could develop better solutions
for routing trucks

  
so they spend less time idling

  
and also could route trucks in a city

  
based on prevailing
wind patterns to reduce smog

  
These are pretty cool solutions
that companies are working on

  
But the real question is

  
if this common purpose
of fighting climate change

  
can help leaders overcome
their data sharing FOMA

  
how do we get them to actually do it

  
Well in our work we found
that it takes three actions

  
to jumpstart a virtuous cycle
of data sharing and innovation

  
First companies need to look for new
unexpected sources of data

  
Second they need to develop new
sustainability solutions quickly

  
And third they need to act
together for change

  
Let's take finding new
unexpected partners for data

  
Well what I mean by that

  
is looking well beyond
the four walls of a company

  
for sources of data that can be combined
with a company's own

  
to analyze and develop
new sustainability solutions

  
But let me give a specific example

  
Let's take farming

  
Farming historically
has been more art than science

  
You've had farmers that make
decisions on when to plant

  
what fertilizer to apply
when to irrigate etc

  
based on their own personal experience
and knowledge of the farm

  
Do you remember "Star Trek"

  
and when Spock could scan
the surface of a planet

  
to know what the habitat was
using the sensors from the “Enterprise”

  
and they could tell whether the planet
could support human life

  
Well I know I'm dating myself
and I'm a bit of a geek

  
but that science fiction
is becoming a reality today

  
You have data from satellites

  
from drones from sensors on the field

  
from connected farming equipment
that is collecting data

  
All of that can be combined

  
so that farmers can make
better realtime decisions on

  
how to improve their overall crop yield

  
reduce the amount of fertilizer
and other chemicals they need

  
and also conserve
scarce resources like water

  
So they can improve their income

  
lower their costs

  
and now they can even start
generating new income sources

  
by planting carbonabsorbing crops
and getting paid for that

  
So really quite fascinating
what's happening in agriculture

  
Next comes innovating quickly
new sustainability solutions

  
What I'm talking about is not
your typical long product road map

  
but we need to have companies
hire data scientists

  
that can analyze all these
different data sources

  
and in new agile ways

  
bring new products and services to market

  
We need to use data and digital quickly
to fight climate change

  
Finally acting together

  
Now let me come back
to the smartcity example

  
If we had transportation
companies and utilities

  
and buildings share data with the city

  
then the city could make better decisions
on investing in renewable energy projects

  
That could mean that you lower
your energy bill

  
and also reduce your carbon footprint

  
Or that transportation data
can be used to decide

  
where charging stations are needed

  
so that we can accelerate the speed
of adoption of electric vehicles

  
And that means maybe you spend
less time in traffic

  
but also your air is cleaner

  
So to really make progress
on more sustainable energy

  
we need to have data sharing across
buildings transportation and utilities

  
All of this data sharing needs to come
together for a brighter future

  
Now 

  
You also have a critical role to play

  
Of course we individually need to be
in control of our own data

  
Imagine you have an app
that allows you to set preferences

  
so that data from your car
from your utilities

  
from your shopping patterns can be shared

  
and you can make decisions
about your own carbon footprint

  
in a very easy way

  
So you can run "what if" scenarios

  
What if I purchase an electric car

  
What if I take the train
from Boston to New York versus fly

  
Or what if I change my shopping pattern
so I shop more locally

  
How much will that impact
my overall carbon footprint

  
Would you be willing to share more data

  
to have more sustainable climate

  
and to make those
climatefriendly decisions

  
Well I for one I'm pretty
excited about this future

  
a future where greater data sharing

  
can really help us
jointly combat climate change

  
What we need is for company leaders
to move away from FOMA

  
and back to good oldfashioned FOMO

  
The future is bright
if all that data can be shared

  
and I don't think
we really want to miss out

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
On October st   residents 
of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood

  
approached William Simpson
who’d just bought a plot in the area

  
and told him to leave

  
The Simpsons would be the second 
Black family

  
in the otherwise white neighborhood  
where they intended to build a home

  
When the Simpsons refused offers 
to buy them out

  
their neighbors tried blocking
their home’s construction

  
They finally moved into their house 
but the incident had a ripple effect

  
Just a few months 
after the mob harassed the Simpsons

  
the first racially restrictive covenant
was put into place in Minneapolis

  
Covenants are agreements in property deeds
that are intended to regulate

  
how the property is to be used

  
Beginning in the mids

  
people in the United States and elsewhere
began employing them in a new way

  
specifically 
to racially restrict properties

  
They wrote clauses into deeds that were 
meant to prevent  all future owners

  
from selling or leasing 
to certain racial and ethnic groups

  
especially Black people

  
Between  and 

  
these racial covenants spread
like wildfire throughout the US

  
making cities more segregated 
and the suburbs more restricted

  
In the county encompassing Minneapolis

  
racial covenants eventually appeared 
on the deeds to more than  homes

  
Not only was this legal

  
but the US Federal Housing Administration

  
promoted racial covenants 
in their underwriting manual

  
While constructing new homes

  
real estate developers began racially
restricting them from the outset

  
Developments were planned as dream
communities for American families—

  
but for white people only

  
In  one company began building
what became widely recognized

  
as the prototype of the postwar American
suburb Levittown New York

  
It was a community 
of more than  identical homes

  
They cost around $ each 
and were intended to be affordable

  
for returning World War II veterans

  
But according to Levittown’s 
racial covenants none of the houses

  
could “be used or occupied by any person 
other than members of the Caucasian race”

  
with one exception servants

  
Between  and 

  
the population of the American suburbs
nearly doubled

  
as white people flocked 
to more racially homogenous areas

  
in a phenomenon known as “white flight”

  
The suburbs spread

  
replacing native ecosystems with miles
of pavement and waterguzzling lawns

  
And their diffuse layout necessitated
car travel

  
American automobile production quadrupled
between  and 

  
cementing the nation's dependence on cars

  
Federal programs like the GI Bill
offered American veterans

  
favorable lending rates for buying homes

  
But it was difficult for people of color
to take advantage of such resources

  
Racial covenants restricted them
from certain neighborhoods

  
And at the same time government programs
labelled neighborhoods of color

  
bad investments and often refused
to insure mortgages in those areas

  
Therefore banks usually wouldn’t lend
money to people purchasing property

  
in neighborhoods of color—
a practice that became known as redlining

  
So instead of owning homes 
that increased in value over time

  
creating wealth that could be passed
to future generations

  
many people of color were forced
to spend their income on rent

  
And even when they were<i </iable 
to buy property

  
their home’s value was less likely
to increase

  
The suburbs boasted culdesacs 
and dead ends that minimized traffic

  
Meanwhile city planners often identified
redlined neighborhoods

  
as inexpensive areas 
for industrial development

  
So the massive freeway projects 
of the midth century

  
disproportionately cut 
through redlined neighborhoods

  
accompanied by heavy industry
and pollution

  
As a result many neighborhoods of color
experience higher rates

  
of drinking water contamination asthma
and other health issues

  
People targeted by racial covenants
increasingly challenged them in court

  
and in  they were finally banned
under the Fair Housing Act

  
But the damage had been done

  
Racial covenants concentrated wealth
and amenities in white neighborhoods

  
and depressed the conditions 
and home values in neighborhoods of color

  
As of  about % of white families 
in the US owned their homes

  
while about % of Black families did

  
That gap is greatest 
in Minnesota’s Twin Cities

  
Across the country
neighborhoods remain segregated

  
and % of all suburban counties
are predominantly white

  
Some landlords real estate agents
and lenders

  
still discriminate against people 
based on race—

  
rejecting them steering them to and away 
from certain neighborhoods

  
or providing inaccessibly
high interest rates

  
Gentrification and exclusionary 
zoning practices also still displace

  
and keep people of color
out of certain neighborhoods

  
Racial covenants are now illegal

  
But they can still be seen
on many housing deeds

  
The legacy of racial covenants is etched
across the pristine lawns

  
of the American suburbs

  
It’s a footnote in the demographic divides
of every city

  
And it’s one of the insidious architects
of the hidden inequalities

  
that shape our world

  
My very first food memory
was when I was three or four

  
It was a warm day

  
and my mom had just picked me
and my sister up from school

  
buckled us into the back
of her dusty blue Ford Taurus

  
She was halfway out
of the school parking lot

  
when she pulled over to the side

  
She strangely reached for her purse
that was resting on the dashboard

  
started fishing around for something
until she found it

  
Then she twisted around to us

  
and she tore open a yellow paper bag

  
of slightly melted Sugar Babies

  
(Audience murmurs)

  
She poured a few of the pellets
into each of our tiny hands

  
Now I want to be clear

  
this was not a normal mom thing

  
This was breaking several rules

  
It was after lunch but before dinner

  
we were in the car

  
(Laughs)

  
we hadn't done anything spectacular
to be celebrated

  
And Sugar Babies are well pure sugar

  
I was so confused

  
But I was a kid so I took the candy
and I started chewing

  
God I felt like I had just been inducted
into the coolest club possible

  
The one that eats candy
on a random Wednesday

  
(Laughs)

  
And then the world it slowed down

  
Everything faded

  
And then everything sharpened

  
There is only one word
for what I felt in that moment

  
Magic

  
Real magic

  
Now most people think
that’s kind of crazy

  
three or four years old

  
I don't remember anything
about my childhood for years after that

  
but I remember that day

  
I remember those Sugar Babies

  
and I remember that feeling

  
Now most people think of magic
as a trick right

  
Abracadabra

  
This seemingly impossible act
put on purely for entertainment

  
But I'd like to challenge that

  
Magic real magic is not an illusion

  
Real magic is the feeling

  
when life transforms
from the ordinary into the extraordinary

  
And not only is it real

  
It is the very thing
that connects us to this world

  
to one another

  
to our entire existence

  
It's the spark of a moment

  
It's the feeling of believing

  
of belonging

  
of getting

  
of being gotten

  
It is the crack

  
that opens up our hearts
and reminds us to let light in

  
Now I own Milk Bar

  
this quirky Americanstyle bakery

  
that I'll tell you
a little bit about later

  
And I have found

  
that magic is often created
by breaking some sort of rule

  
Like the "no sweets before dinner" rule

  
Or wearing overalls
to a corporate board meeting

  
Or simply daring to defy the expectations
of the people around us

  
Now as a kid

  
breaking the rules usually
only got us in trouble right

  
But as adults it's a different story

  
Breaking the rules pushing boundaries

  
challenging the norm

  
asking why why not

  
It does something to us

  
It shakes us from sleepwalking

  
And it makes space for magic to sneak in

  
Now I was raised by matriarchs

  
fierce heroic grandmas
who loved to bake in their free time

  
And they knew good and well that food
was for nutrition and sustenance

  
but they didn't care

  
(Laughs)

  
They'd baked as their way
of breaking the rules

  
They'd make batches of lemon bars
instead of casseroles

  
or onepot wonders

  
And they put those baked goods in baggies

  
and hand them out

  
hand that magic out
to the most unassuming people

  
The newcomer to the neighborhood

  
the mail carrier or my personal favorite

  
the receptionist at the dentist office

  
(Laughs)

  
Now I knew what the receiving end
of magic felt like

  
from that Sugar Baby moment

  
But witnessing what the giving part
of real magic did 

  
It moved these people

  
It was aweinspiring

  
And so I decided

  
that baking would be my way
of making magic in the world

  
creating a moment and then giving it away

  
A magic pyramid scheme basically

  
that I wanted needed more of

  
Only my mom and my grandmas
thought that baking was just a hobby

  
But I knew it could be more than that

  
So I moved to New York City
to become a professional pastry chef

  
I went to culinary school;

  
I climbed the ladder of fancy restaurants

  
making fancy desserts
to become the very best of the best

  
Only 

  
I never found magic in those beautiful
delicate plated desserts

  
I could only find my magic
in a cookie or a slice of cake

  
or a gooey underbaked pie

  
And so when I opened Milk Bar

  
that bakery that I was telling you about

  
I decided I wasn't going to frost
the sides of a cake

  
like the textbooks taught me

  
(Laughter)

  
I decided I was going to load
cookie dough with marshmallows

  
or pretzels and potato chips

  
and butterscotch chips and coffee

  
tossing convention out the window

  
I wanted people to eat birthday cake
not just on their birthday

  
but any day they wanted

  
I knew that my magic came in the form
of these simple baked goods

  
but I also knew that simple
approachable accessible

  
nostalgic flavors

  
were my best jumpingoff place
to create new desserts

  
Almost as though fancy
were the enemy of delicious

  
I’d go to county fairs to nosh

  
I'd go to the diner
and order slices of pie

  
from that revolving display case

  
I'd take french fries and dip them
in chocolate milkshake and dream

  
And then I'd go into the kitchen
and tie on my apron

  
and start mixing up a new creation

  
rooted in something known
and safe and loved

  
but reaching far beyond
what anyone thought accessible

  
Or approachable

  
Or doable

  
Breaking the banking rules
became my daily ritual

  
I mean who says a layer cake can't taste
like salty malty sweet pretzels

  
I mean my culinary instructors for one

  
(Laughs)

  
"Watch me" I'd think

  
And I'd take pretzels

  
toast them in the oven
to deepen their flavor

  
then grind them
into a powderlike consistency

  
and substitute some
of the cake flour in a recipe

  
for that pretzel powder

  
It's pretty good

  
When I was opening Milk Bar
I knew I wanted to serve ice cream

  
A rebellious kind of ice cream

  
No surprise right

  
So I decided to buy a soft serve machine

  
which for the record
was very rebellious at the time

  
I had to decide what flavor to make

  
I mean why do we only accept
chocolate and vanilla

  
as ice cream flavors

  
I needed to come up
with something better different

  
Push that boundary

  
I knew I had to come up
with a flavor of milk

  
that was different

  
Milk is like the base
of any great ice cream

  
So I sat out inspiration
at my hour bodega

  
Favorite place to go

  
Because that's where we all shop

  
that's where our simple
taste buds are formed

  
it's the flavors we know

  
Up and down the aisles till I hit it

  
My favorite section
of the grocery store as a kid

  
the cereal aisle

  
Now as a kid my mom and I
had an agreement

  
I was a pretty picky eater

  
and we agreed that I could have
as much cereal as I wanted

  
as long as I drank
all the calciumrich milk

  
at the bottom of the bowl

  
I mean I thought it was highway robbery

  
Does she not understand how good
that sugary sweet milk was at the bottom

  
That's interesting

  
That's a really delicious flavor of milk

  
It moved me

  
It made sense to me

  
but would it make sense to other people

  
Figured I'd give it a try

  
So I went back to the kitchen

  
and made the equivalent
of a giant bowl of cereal

  
I strained out all that delicious milk

  
and I spun it into ice cream

  
Put it on the menu

  
And I've got to tell you even now

  
people stop me on the street

  
to tell me about their cerealmilk
ice cream moment

  
"So good"

  
"Seemingly a little naughty"

  
I mean how did I know
that was their flavor

  
That's the flavor they eat
when they're wearing pajamas

  
when no one's looking

  
The flavor of their childhood

  
These people will tell me
about every detail of the day

  
They will tell me about the weather
the company they kept

  
the way that an ordinary moment
was transformed into something magical

  
with a simple bite

  
I built my business with the same
"challenge the norm" mentality

  
Rather than measure my business's success
by the profit or loss sheet

  
by the average order value

  
the other metrics that businesses use

  
to know if they're doing well

  
I decided we'd measure our impact
by the twinkle in people's eyes

  
By the "Oh I can't put that down" feeling

  
that they had when they ate
one of our desserts

  
I chose to put women
at the helm of my organization

  
Because when I looked
around the hospitality industry

  
people running operations
folks holding CEO titles

  
they were all men

  
I mean why

  
I was raised by these fierce matriarchs
who handled business

  
and I wanted my organization
to look like that

  
I want to show the world
what women were capable of

  
and what a "bakery" could be

  
Push back on that cute little box
people like to put us in

  
And in turn the rules broke for us

  
The magic our magic got out

  
Word spread without us spending
a dollar on marketing

  
Rare in our industry

  
we grew our business
without diluting the business

  
I mean we won awards

  
no tiny East Village bakery
has any business winning

  
(Laughs)

  
It's pretty incredible

  
Even today

  
I get to witness that feeling

  
that same one that my grandmas
conjured up in my childhood

  
We ship cakes all across the country

  
we keep our doors open from early
in the morning until late at night

  
It's insane for a bakery to do

  
But we do it because we're
obsessed with it

  
We're obsessed with what we do

  
We teach classes we share recipes

  
despite any concerns of copycats

  
or intellectual property infringements

  
because that's what you do

  
when you benefit
from what came before you

  
and you plan on passing it
along long after you

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
When you know you're here
to give not take

  
and leave this place
better than you found it

  
See mom you can bake for a living

  
Pretty cool if you ask me

  
Now I don't have
the full equation cracked

  
but I do know that it starts
with the decision to act

  
My mom she could have driven
that car home routinely

  
but she decided that that day
would not be like the others

  
She threw out that rule book
for just a second

  
I carry this lesson with me

  
that every day has within it hundreds

  
thousands of opportunities
to create real magic

  
Only they disappear

  
Unless you reach out and grab them

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
A few years ago I sailed on a ship
that comes from an earlier era

  
when moving goods by sea
didn't mean polluting the planet

  
Our voyage to the Caribbean
was eyeopening

  
and not just because I learned
that apparently I’m incurably seasick

  
(Laughter)

  
I also saw what it's like

  
when you take away the diesel fumes
and the black smoke

  
that spew from today's
freighters and ports

  
Instead our vessel smelled
like fresh sea breeze

  
and the bags of cardamom we carried

  
and all that camomile tea I was chugging

  
Nearly every modern cargo ship
relies on highly polluting fossil fuels

  
Fortunately there's a way
to clean up the industry

  
beyond just reviving
oldfashioned sailing ships

  
and it's 

  
green ammonia

  
If you know anything about ammonia

  
it's probably that it's stinky
it's toxic it's potentially explosive

  
So it's a great place to start right

  
Ammonia is mainly used today
to make chemicals and fertilizers

  
But for many reasons
industry experts are convinced

  
that ammonia could be a gamechanging way
to drive giant cargo ships

  
and that it could be used safely
and be costcompetitive

  
Tens of thousands of freighters
crisscross the oceans every day

  
bringing the food we eat
the clothes we wear the cars we drive

  
Container ships alone

  
carry some four trillion dollars
worth of goods by sea every year

  
That's roughly the GDP of Germany

  
At the same time

  
the shipping industry
contributes a significant share

  
of the world's annual
greenhouse gas emissions

  
If shipping were a country

  
it'd be the sixth largest emitter of CO

  
trailing just behind Japan

  
And as world economies grow
and populations rise

  
shipping's emissions are expected to soar

  
unless the industry
charts a cleaner course

  
Green ammonia really first came
to my attention in 

  
at the UN Climate Change Conference
in Bonn Germany

  
At the panel I attended
ammonia seemed kind of like an aside

  
or something we should be keeping tabs on

  
Since then the industry
has really coalesced around ammonia

  
as the next dominant shipping fuel

  
Chemical companies and investors

  
are spending millions of dollars
to build green ammonia plants

  
and shipbuilders and manufacturers

  
are busy developing
the necessary technology

  
The first ammoniapowered ships
are just around the corner

  
So what's so special
about this pungent gas

  
Well to start ammonia doesn't contain
any carbon molecules

  
so it doesn't create carbon dioxide
when used as fuel

  
Instead it contains one part nitrogen 

  
which is the main component of air 

  
and three parts hydrogen
which is a building block of water

  
It's possible to make ammonia
without using any fossil fuels

  
That's what makes it "green" ammonia

  
Think of it like this

  
instead of the oil wells
and petroleum refineries

  
that make today's dirty diesel fuels

  
picture solar panels or wind turbines
or hydropower plants

  
Renewable electricity is the foundation
of this whole ammoniamaking ordeal

  
We can start with electrolysis

  
which uses electricity to split water
into hydrogen and oxygen

  
Then renewables can power the process
that separates nitrogen from air

  
And so with our hydrogen and nitrogen
we can combine the two

  
in an industrial process
at high temperatures

  
to make NH  ammonia

  
Now if you want to use
this ammonia to power

  
your thousandfootlong freighter

  
you have two options

  
The first is an internal
combustion engine

  
so similar to how diesel
is used in ships today

  
but with certain modifications

  
Experts think that the first vessels
to use ammonia in their engines

  
will be chemical tankers

  
because they already carry it
in their cargo holds

  
So they'll be like the early adopters

  
The next options is to use a fuel cell

  
Fuel cells create electricity
through a chemical reaction

  
and that's what drives the ship's motors
and turns the propellers

  
In Norway work is underway

  
to launch the world's first
ammoniafuelcell ship

  
in just a few years' time

  
So we can make green ammonia

  
and we can use it
in fuel cells or engines

  
The final piece of the ammonia
puzzle is the infrastructure

  
the storage facilities the pipelines
the distribution networks 

  
everything that's needed to ensure
a ship can fill its tanks

  
anywhere in the world

  
And none of this is particularly novel

  
because we already have infrastructure

  
for the chemical
and fertilizer industries

  
Now it just needs to be built near ports

  
and at a global scale 

  
and with great caution

  
So what's needed
to take ammonia mainstream

  
We can draw a rough parallel
to the rise of electric cars

  
A decade ago

  
about  EVs
were on the roads worldwide

  
Then more and more countries
adopted policies

  
encouraging people to buy EVs

  
supporting manufacturers

  
and to build up charging infrastructure

  
And as sales climbed
and production boomed

  
the cost of batteries
and other components plummeted

  
making it easier for more people
to afford electric cars

  
So now instead of  EVs
it's more like  million

  
and green ammonia
could follow a similar path

  
in the shipping industry

  
Policies to curb emissions
and incentivize green investments

  
could spur a shift away from fossil fuels

  
And as ammonia catches on

  
fuel prices and technology costs
could decline in step

  
enabling more ship operators
to make the switch

  
And while all of that is happening

  
a much bigger story will be playing out
on the global scale

  
the rising development and plunging costs
of renewable energy supplies

  
Giant offshore wind farms

  
sprawling solar arrays
and other technologies

  
could provide the electrons
needed to make that green ammonia

  
Green ammonia might be
the main fuel source

  
on future cargo ships

  
but it doesn’t have to be
the only clean technology onboard

  
Ships will likely use
a combination of tools

  
Batteries can already power
the lights and equipment on giant ships

  
and certainly smaller vessels
can be fully batterypowered today

  
Design fixes like supersleek hulls
and dolphinlike flippers

  
can improve ships' efficiency

  
And another technology
that's quickly gaining traction

  
is called "windassisted propulsion"

  
which puts a modern twist
on an old idea of harnessing wind

  
One cargo ship I sailed on
in the North Sea

  
uses devices called "rotor sails"

  
These are foottall tubes

  
that spin around
like hyperactive barber's poles

  
which produces a forward thrust

  
and reduces demand on the diesel engines

  
It's really exciting to see
these things whip around

  
but it's funny how almost blasé
the crew was about the whole thing

  
They push a button

  
the tubes swirl to life
the ships saves fuel

  
and they can all carry on
with their normal tasks

  
as we sailed from Rotterdam

  
to this industrial eyesore
in northern England

  
and back again

  
Meanwhile of course

  
I spent my time admiring the sails

  
and then curling up in the fetal position
as the sea knocked our ship around

  
The maritime industry
is at a pivotal moment

  
in its long and storied history

  
Over the last few centuries

  
fossil fuels have powered the freighters
that have transformed global trade

  
connecting cotton fields
to farflung garment factories

  
and bringing blueberries
from one side of the equator to the other

  
Coalpowered steamships made it possible
to travel farther and faster

  
and diesel engines
took this into overdrive

  
What began in the early th century
as a humble canal boat

  
puttering along with this tiny engine

  
has since become giant container ships

  
that stretch as long
as skyscrapers stand tall

  
We know that to keep the planet
from warming further

  
we must completely transform the way
that we power our homes our cars

  
and the freighters that bring us
all our precious stuff

  
The shipping industry
must join the rest of the world

  
in addressing climate change

  
and it could do that
with the help of green ammonia

  
Thank you so much

  
(Applause)

  
It’s moments after the Big Bang
and wow you’re still reeling

  
You’re a particle of matter 
amidst a chaotic stew of forces

  
fusion and annihilation

  
If you’re lucky
and avoid being destroyed by antimatter

  
you'll be the seed of a future galaxy

  
You gravitate towards a ring of particles
that have devised a game

  
A friendly gluon explains

  
there are an equal number of matter 
and antimatter particles

  
At the blow of a cosmic whistle

  
every particle of matter with a particle 
of antimatter to its immediate right

  
will merge with that anitparticle
to—poof!— both annihilate

  
The circle will tighten 
to make a smaller circle

  
and the process will repeat 
until just one particle of matter remains

  
They’d been waiting for someone like you
as with a perfectly balanced setup

  
no one would be left in the end

  
As guest of honor they’ll let you choose 
where to insert yourself into the ring

  
What spot should you choose to make sure
you’re the last particle standing

  
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
Explanation in 

  
A general strategy can’t rely on knowing
what the circle looks like

  
But we can rely on how it should end 
with you as the last particle standing

  
Let's start there and work backwards

  
Just before this there were also 
some matter/antimatter pairs

  
Here’s  for the sake of example

  
This right away suggests a strategy

  
You can simulate annihilations 
in any circle

  
by marking all pairs 
of adjacent particles

  
then the newly adjacent pairs and so on
to reach this final set

  
If you map them back 
to the original circle

  
standing to the immediate left 
of those final matter particles

  
or the immediate right 
of final antiparticles

  
means you’ll reach this endgame state 
and survive

  
So here are the safe spots 
in all three given circles

  
You find a good position and experience
the bittersweet radiance

  
of your new friends pairing off
and becoming pure energy

  
You’re soon left alone

  
But wait a minute!

  
Today’s the big day

  
You’re an intelligent creature of matter
amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races

  
Every hundred million years

  
sentient species of the galaxy 
send emissaries to the core

  
to pay tribute to the galactic seed 
you’re all descended from

  
Each of the  attendees

  
has brought a cube of matter 
and a cube of antimatter

  
Except you you’ve been chosen 
to represent your famed ancestor

  
and reenact its moment of choice

  
Everyone places their matter 
and antimatter cubes in a ring

  
Your job pick a spot to stand 
where you won’t be annihilated

  
The ring is too large to simulate
annihilations like before

  
but you have a programmable device
you can point at spots between cubes

  
The device can detect the full sequence
of cubes around the circle

  
count cubes of each type
perform arithmetic

  
and carry out simple logical commands

  
How do you program your device 
to identify safe spots

  
Pause to figure it out for yourself
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Answer in 

  
Let’s go back to our earlier approach

  
running time backwards 
starting from you alone

  
then a sequence of pairs of cubes

  
A second step back produces more pairs
nestled between existing cubes

  
As does the next and the next
each adding nestled pairs

  
like a Russian doll 
of fundamental particles

  
A pair never forms around an existing cube
because only adjacent cubes annihilate

  
Your survival depends 
on the matter particles to your right

  
buffering you from antimatter

  
We can mathematically model this idea 
with a sum starting with your +

  
For instance this would be +++

  
From your perspective 
no matter how far you look

  
this sum will be positive

  
Considering how we introduced pairs 
this makes sense—

  
each inserted plus was immediately
followed by a minus

  
If we examine the starting position
of any other matter cube

  
its sum will eventually hit zero

  
The moment that happens 
marks its exact annihilation partner

  
Again our introduction of pairs 
reflects this;

  
nestled pairs only delay the inevitable
for the outer cubes

  
We can now program the device

  
Start a running sum with +
representing you

  
and scan around the circle

  
For each matter cube add one

  
and for each antimatter cube 
subtract one

  
If all  cubes have been scanned

  
without the sum ever hitting 

  
that spot is safe

  
Nothing left to do 
but enjoy the fireworks

  
Hello everyone

  
My name is Orit yes

  
And I study insurance

  
Telling people that you study insurance
is not a good way to start a conversation

  
In fact if ever you need
to end the conversation

  
try it tell people you study insurance

  
People don't want to talk about insurance

  
They don't think it's all that exciting

  
But I disagree

  
I find insurance fascinating;
in fact I find it magical

  
And today I'd like to show you why

  
Now the famous author Franz Kafka

  
used to work for an insurance
company in Prague

  
And this is what Kafka
had to say about insurance

  
He said "Insurance is like a religion

  
Insurance is like a primitive religion

  
It's the religion of people
who believe that by having insurance

  
they can ward off evil"

  
So according to Kafka

  
what leads us to buy insurance
is not rational thinking

  
but magical thinking

  
It's the belief that if I have insurance

  
somehow magically those negative events
that I fear in the future

  
they're not going to happen

  
Of course this is totally irrational

  
It's like believing
that if you have an umbrella

  
it's not going to rain

  
If your car gets stolen yes

  
the insurance company
will cushion the blow

  
With the compensation money

  
you could probably afford a new car

  
But the fact that you have insurance

  
does not make your car
less likely to be stolen

  
The risk is the same
whether you are insured or not

  
So are people this naive

  
Do they really believe
that if they have insurance

  
they are less at risk

  
Yes

  
Perhaps not consciously but they do

  
Let me show you

  
In one of my studies

  
I asked people to predict
what is the likelihood

  
that in the future they will suffer
all kinds of medical misfortunes

  
yhat they will need an operation
physiotherapy or nursing care

  
Another group was asked
to make the same predictions

  
but we first asked them

  
"Do you have health insurance"

  
And of course they do

  
Israel has universal coverage

  
Reminding people
that they have health insurance

  
had a fascinating effect

  
It made them feel less at risk

  
Surprisingly the effect
was not limited to medical problems

  
It also made them believe
that they are less likely to lose money

  
and my personal favorite

  
asking people in Tel Aviv
if they have health insurance

  
made the prospect of a war
in Europe seem less likely

  
(Laughter)

  
And that's magic

  
Kafka was right

  
There is an interesting paradox here

  
We buy insurance against those events
that we fear the most

  
But once we are armed
with this protection measure

  
we feel that we are no longer
at risk somehow magically

  
And this protection effect
is not unique to insurance policies

  
We see it with other
protection measures as well

  
Let me show you

  
In  the citizens of Israel

  
were very worried about a possible
military attack by Iran

  
And the government was distributing
gas masks to all the citizens

  
At the time we called people
and asked them to predict

  
what are the chances
that Iran would attack Israel

  
with weapons of mass destruction

  
The ratings were quite high

  
People were worried

  
But if we first asked them
"Do you have a gas mask"

  
then the ratings dropped dramatically

  
And that's magic

  
Apart from the fact
that gas masks are largely useless

  
against weapons of mass destruction

  
the fact that you have a gas mask
is unlikely to affect the strategic

  
or the tactical decision
of a foreign power

  
We have to remember

  
insurance is an antidote
it's not a vaccine

  
It doesn’t ward off evil;

  
it doesn't eliminate
the risks that we face

  
However when it comes to insurance

  
the distinction between
an antidote and a vaccine

  
somehow gets blurred in our minds

  
Why does it happen

  
It happens because people
are not that good

  
at assessing risks rationally

  
Let me give you an example

  
When I arranged my flight to come here

  
I had to decide if I wanted
to buy travel insurance

  
Rationally I should have based
this decision on several considerations

  
the price of the policy of course

  
the value of my luggage

  
the aggravation
that I'm likely to experience

  
if my luggage gets lost

  
And of course the likelihood
of such an event right

  
But most of the time we're just too busy
to make such rational calculations

  
And anyway

  
I doubt that Lufthansa are very keen
to share their damage statistics with me

  
So what do we do instead

  
We rely on our intuition

  
So how do we evaluate risks intuitively

  
We start by imagining
the outcomes that we fear

  
So here I am

  
it's late at night
I'm sitting at this airport

  
all the other passengers
already collected their luggage and left

  
I realize that my own suitcase
is now probably heading to the North Pole

  
Thinking about this scenario
creates anxiety

  
and then we use the level
of anxiety that we feel

  
in order to assess the probability

  
So if I'm feeling terrified

  
I will infer that the risk
of such an event is quite high

  
But you see this is
an intuitive risk estimate

  
It is entirely psychological
and emotionbased

  
which is why it is also highly susceptible
to the magic of insurance

  
Insurance reduces our anxiety

  
First because the outcomes
that we imagine are suddenly less grim

  
Yes I'm sitting at the airport
yes it's late at night

  
all the other passengers had left

  
but there will be this guy there
they would give me a voucher

  
eventually I will get
compensated it's OK

  
Also because we are conditioned
to associate insurance with safety

  
security tranquility and peace of mind

  
And if I'm feeling less anxious

  
I would infer that the risk
is not that high

  
So there you have it

  
I have insurance and the risk is gone

  
But why do we associate insurance
with peace of mind

  
Well first in many languages

  
this is exactly what the word
"insurance" means

  
It comes from the word "sure"
which means lack of doubts

  
no unknowns that would sneak up
and bite you in the future right

  
But also because traditionally

  
this is how insurance was promoted

  
Let me show you an example

  
This is a lovely advertising toy

  
that was distributed to visitors
at the British exhibition in 

  
So you see this guy
and he looks terrified

  
He is barraged by the bricks of doom

  
fire accident falling on his head

  
And the tag on the bottom

  
it reads "anxiety" which perfectly
describes the guy's expression

  
But if you pull on that tag

  
something slides inside
and the guy transforms

  
First he now has the protection
of the Prudential insurance helmet

  
and his expression
is changed into a smile

  
You know why

  
Because Prudential insurance
dispels anxiety

  
Modern images of insurance
convey the same message

  
Insurance logos often incorporate
supporting hand below

  
and umbrellas above ultimate protection

  
And then travel insurance ads

  
They could easily be mistaken
for vacation brochures right

  
Romantic couples
exotic islands palm trees

  
And if for some reason
you need images of smiling

  
happy people wearing white

  
do an image Google search
with the words "pension plans"

  
or "health insurance"

  
Insurance ads rarely show you
sick people smashed cars torn suitcase

  
The message is loud and clear

  
You have insurance

  
all is well in the world

  
However to get us to buy insurance

  
the promoters must also work our fears

  
Which is why right after
you paid a lot of money

  
for a top of the line refrigerator

  
the same seller who just moments ago

  
were explaining
how reliable this product is

  
is now telling you that it may
break down at any moment

  
which is why you should buy
the extended warranty

  
And with some credit cards
you could get free travel insurance

  
All you need to do is to call the agent

  
But when you make this call

  
you are told yeah but the free deal
is only for the basic plan

  
Basic plan doesn't sound
good already right

  
And then you get to hear a list of things
that you are not covered against

  
like fires and heart transplant
and floods etc

  
But if you pay one more
dollar a day right

  
And your active imagination does the rest

  
with each item on the list
your anxiety is mounting

  
and you don't ask yourself
"Hey I'm going to Paris

  
why would I care about a tsunami"

  
You pay the dollar and all is well
in the world again

  
In fact

  
just realizing that we are not
covered against something

  
is enough to distort
our perception of risk

  
I once asked people to imagine
in one of my studies

  
that they're going to go on a trip

  
and they plan to buy
travel insurance at the airport

  
But by the time they reach the counter

  
boarding had already started

  
and they have to board that airplane
painfully aware that they are not covered

  
And then I asked them to assess
all kinds of travelrelated risks

  
And these were dramatically inflated

  
compared to the ratings of people
who did have insurance

  
For example lost luggage

  
the risk of lost luggage
almost  percent

  
What are the chances
that you will need hospitalization

  
Almost  percent well  percent

  
And how about
you will need to be rescued

  
Thirtyone percent

  
I remember the first time
I saw this data I was speechless

  
I was thinking

  
"Guys if this is what you believe
why would you ever leave home"

  
you know

  
(Laughter)

  
Yeah

  
Boarding an airplane
with no insurance is tempting fate

  
It's like realizing that your insurance
policy had just expired

  
and not renewing it

  
Grave danger indeed

  
Your appliances they know you know

  
So we buy insurance
and restore our peace of mind

  
And now you're probably asking yourself

  
"But peace of mind is good

  
What's wrong with peace of mind" right

  
"What's the problem"

  
The problem is that we are highly
likely to be overinsured

  
What does it mean

  
Well first

  
we may be protecting ourselves
against really unlikely events

  
like a tsunami in Paris

  
Or we may be paying a lot
to prevent a trivial loss

  
Does it really make sense to extend
the warranty on an old washing machine

  
And if you will examine
your own policies back at home

  
many of you will find
that you have redundant coverage

  
You are paying several policies
on the same event

  
Many of you do that

  
Me included and I should know better

  
So 

  
This kind of behavior
can get people in debt

  
and even if they don't

  
this is money that we could spend
in far more pleasurable ways right

  
At least I can

  
But selling peace of mind is a problem
for the insurance companies as well

  
Why

  
The insurance companies are well aware
of the problem called “moral hazard”

  
You see when people are insured

  
they become negligent

  
They start leaving
their valuables out in the open

  
They don't check their fire alarms
they drive faster

  
In short they act in ways
which put them at greater risk

  
Now the insurance companies

  
they believe that we behave like that

  
because we know that if something happens

  
someone else will pay

  
Which is why many policies
include deductibles

  
That's the money that comes
out of your pocket right

  
So the deductibles are there to make sure

  
that some of the risk
will stay with the client

  
But based on the research
that I just shared with you

  
it is entirely possible

  
that the reason that we are careless

  
is not just that we think
that someone else will pay

  
but it's also the magical belief
that if I have insurance

  
it's not going to rain

  
The damage is not going to happen

  
and magical thinking
is not susceptible to deductibles

  
What are the lessons to be learned

  
For us for you

  
Next time you consider buying insurance

  
remember Kafka

  
Ask yourself

  
Am I buying insurance
for the right reasons

  
Am I making a sound economic decision

  
or merely trying to please my psyche

  
As for the insurance companies

  
I hope they will consider
changing their message

  
Don't sell magical happiness

  
Encourage us to buy insurance
when it is economically rational

  
and the responsible thing to do

  
And finally

  
guys I hope that next time
someone says "I study insurance"

  
you would say "Wonderful

  
Please tell me more"

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Now when you think of the industries
most responsible for climate change

  
you probably summon up
an image of an oil rig right

  
Maybe even a coal mine

  
or a megafarm

  
perhaps heavy engineering

  
But there’s one industry
that’s never mentioned in that list

  
even though every other industry
depends upon it

  
I’m talking about
an economic sector that makes 

  
nothing

  
It has no stock

  
no warehouses

  
no factories

  
It’s entirely powered by brains

  
by spreadsheets

  
and by PowerPoint

  
Who is this mystery industry

  
The professional services
of advertising and PR firms

  
the big management consultancies

  
the corporate lawyers and lobbyists

  
Together this sector is worth
over two trillion dollars a year

  
Let’s call it the “X industry”

  
where X is for influence

  
Now when it comes to climate change

  
each individual firm in this sector
has the carbon footprint

  
probably no bigger
than your average kindergarten

  
But the brainprint of the X industry
is felt everywhere

  
And that’s because these problemsolvers
and storytellers act

  
as the grease in the wheel
of all other businesses on Earth

  
And that gives the X industry
an outsize influence

  
on the likelihood that we reach netzero

  
or they will be one of the primary
architects of climate destruction

  
Now how

  
Remember that oil rig
we imagined a moment ago

  
Think about how it’s actually built

  
I’ve seen this firsthand

  
It takes a village of X industry
advisers to raise a rig

  
First 

  
often

  
the oil exploration proposals
are financially modeled

  
by one of the big constultancies

  
Then the lobbying firms
push through regulatory approval

  
often years if not decades ahead
of a single drop of oil being pumped

  
Then the PR agencies

  
they come in and they work
to get local communities onside

  
And the legal firms
squash any legal objection

  
Finally the creative agencies
craft influence campaigns

  
to help sell the image of the oil industry

  
and to sell the product itself

  
Oil companies know how to drill for oil

  
but they’ve outsourced
almost everything else

  
to this army of publicists
and consultants

  
to lawyers and to lobbyists

  
We all remember the Deepwater
Horizon disaster of 

  
when BP polluted the Gulf of Mexico

  
with over four million barrels of oil

  
What you might not know

  
is that BP admitted

  
to spending three times as much
on promotional advertising

  
in the year after the disaster
than in the year before

  
And arguably

  
the X industry has done
a better job of cleaning up BP’s image

  
than BP has yet done cleaning up
the Gulf of Mexico

  
(Applause)

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Oh come on come on

  
Is it really fair for me to hold
the X industry responsible

  
for the environmental impact
of their clients

  
There is no official way
to do so just yet

  
We recognize only three scopes
of carbon emission

  
Scopes one and two

  
all the direct emissions
from your fleets and your factories

  
and the power that you purchase

  
In the UK

  
the advertising association has estimated

  
that the entire carbon footprint
of the UK ad industry

  
worth over  billion dollars a year

  
is just  million tonnes

  
 million tonnes

  
Now scope three

  
the third scope

  
this is a bit harder

  
This is all the indirect emissions
from how people use your products

  
or from your supply chain

  
And that’s a necessary headache
for a lot of companies

  
to start taking control over

  
But technically the X industry
barely moves the dial here either

  
That’s why I believe that the X industry
needs a new scope X

  
a way to account
for the emissions of influence

  
Now the 

  
(Applause)

  
The experts at the Purpose
Disruptors network have made a start

  
at doing just that

  
They looked at a single
advertising campaign made for Audi

  
Now this campaign won one of the big
effectiveness awards in advertising

  
And the car company
and their advertising agency claimed

  
that this single campaign
generated  billion dollars

  
of incremental revenue for Audi

  
The ad campaign sold a lot of cars

  
And if their claim is correct

  
it also generated  million tonnes
of additional carbon for Audi

  
So this is a onetofive ratio

  
between the impact
of an entire industry 

  
the entire ad industry 

  
versus one single advertising campaign

  
It is time for those of us like me

  
who work in this industry

  
to take our responsibility seriously

  
And that starts with being honest
about who pays our bills

  
The X industry is famously
murky about that

  
And so my firm in  produced
the first client disclosure report

  
It’s very simple

  
We just disclosed our revenue
by the client industries which we serve

  
I’m so pleased to say
that  other ad agencies

  
consultancies and PR companies

  
have now promised to do the same

  
(Applause)

  
But our industry is dominated
by a handful of really big consultancies

  
and advertising agencies

  
and not one of them
have yet promised to join us

  
And this really matters

  
because the X industry is hiring up
many of the most inventive

  
creative

  
knowledgeable

  
and influential minds that humanity has

  
And those are the exact
same skills that we need

  
to change the course of climate change

  
Now we need all of that X industry talent
to stop serving destruction

  
and start serving solutions

  
And if you work in the X industry

  
you’re probably beginning to feel
a little bit uncomfortable right now

  
Good

  
(Laughter)

  
(Applause)

  
I want you to ask yourself

  
Are you selling your talent
to the right people

  
Are you serving the causes
of climate change or the solutions to it

  
And are you using all that vaunted ability
to influence your clients

  
or just to influence their critics

  
This must be the solutions decade

  
and we’re nearly two years into our window

  
to change our systems
towards climate justice

  
towards clean energy

  
circular systems

  
sustainable and equitable lifestyles

  
This solutions decade desperately requires
really goodquality financial modeling

  
It requires a really strong
legal framework

  
great research

  
It really needs public support

  
It needs the right regulatory rules

  
And it needs creative storytelling

  
and that’s what my X industry
could deliver

  
This year I changed my job title
to “Chief Solutionist”

  
I changed it to constantly remind myself
of the job that needs doing

  
Because as an X industry leader myself

  
I can either serve
the solutions every day

  
or by default

  
I’m serving destruction

  
There is no middle ground here

  
There must be no
carefully worded rationales

  
And the X industry can no longer pretend
it can remain neutral

  
Now if we do that

  
perhaps we could become
a league of solutionists

  
and shift all of this creativity

  
inventiveness

  
knowledge and influence

  
towards fixing climate change

  
And then this invisible

  
and intangible

  
and incredibly influential X industry

  
can finally stop being part of the problem

  
and become part of the solution

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
In the mids two familiar spires
towered above the morning fog

  
Stretching  meters into the sky

  
these ton towers would help support
California’s Golden Gate Bridge

  
But since they were currently
in Pennsylvania

  
they first had to be dismantled
packaged and shipped piece by piece

  
over  kilometers away

  
Moving the bridge’s towers 
across a continent

  
was just one of the challenges 
facing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss

  
the project's lead engineers

  
Even before construction began 
the pair faced all kinds of opposition

  
The military feared the bridge 
would make the important harbor

  
an even more vulnerable target

  
Ferry companies claimed the bridge
would steal their business

  
and residents wanted to preserve
the area's natural scenery

  
Worse still many engineers thought
the project was impossible

  
The Golden Gate Strait was home 
to kilometerperhour winds

  
swirling tides an endless blanket of fog

  
and the earthquakeprone 
San Andreas fault

  
But Strauss was convinced 
the bridge could be built;

  
and that it would provide 
San Francisco’s commuters

  
more reliable passage to the city

  
He was however a bit out of his depth

  
Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait
used a cantilever bridge

  
This kind of bridge consists 
of a single beam anchored at one end

  
and extended horizontally
like a diving board

  
Since these bridges can only extend so far
before collapsing under their own weight

  
Strauss’s design used two cantilevers
linked by a structure in the middle

  
But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif
convinced Strauss

  
to pursue a different approach
the suspension bridge

  
Where a cantilever bridge is supported
from one end

  
a suspension bridge suspends its deck
from cables strung across the gap

  
The result is a more flexible structure

  
that’s resilient to winds 
and shifting loads

  
This kind of design had long been used 
for small rope bridges

  
And in the s 
advanced steel manufacturing

  
could create cables of bundled wire 
to act as strong steel rope

  
for largescale construction

  
At the time the Golden Gate Bridge

  
was the longest and tallest 
suspension bridge ever attempted

  
and its design was only possible
due to these innovations

  
But cables and towers of this size 
could only be built at large steelworks

  
on the country’s east coast

  
While the recently completed Panama Canal

  
made it possible to ship these components
to California

  
reassembling the towers on site 
didn’t go quite as smoothly

  
It was relatively easy to find a stable
shallow foundation for the north tower

  
But building the south tower 
essentially required erecting

  
a tenstory building underwater

  
Since the strait’s depth prevented them
drilling or digging the foundations

  
bombs were dropped on the ocean floor
creating openings for pouring concrete

  
A seawall was built to protect the site
from powerful currents

  
and workers operated in minute shifts
between tides

  
The towers had so many compartments
that each worker carried a set of plans

  
to prevent getting lost

  
And at one point an earthquake rocked
the south tower

  
nearly  meters in each direction

  
Strauss took worker safety very seriously
requiring hard hats at all times

  
and stretching a safety net 
below the towers

  
But not even these precautions 
could prevent

  
an entire scaffolding platform
from falling in 

  
carrying ten workers to their deaths

  
Once the towers were complete 
workers spun the cables in place

  
hung suspenders at foot intervals
and laid down the concrete roadway

  
The bridge was finished
but there was still one more task ahead

  
painting it

  
After production the steel had been 
coated with a reddish paint primer

  
it maintained throughout construction

  
But the Navy had been pushing hard

  
to paint the bridge 
a tactical black and yellow

  
Consulting architect Irving Morrow 
actually thought the primer itself

  
paired nicely with the strait’s 
natural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone

  
Citing numerous letters from locals

  
Morrow’s page pitch 
to paint the bridge “international orange”

  
beat out the Navy’s plans

  
And today this iconic color 
still complements

  
the strait’s blue water green hills 
and rolling fog

  
When we look at poor
smallholder farmers across the world

  
and particularly in my country India

  
we often think that what they need
is access to better tools

  
education government support
markets and so on

  
Yes they need all that

  
But what they really need
is a reliable and regular income

  
to live with dignity

  
A dependable income

  
even if it is as small
as  dollars a month

  
is essential for them
to stay out of poverty

  
Today their incomes
are in and out of poverty

  
which is extremely painful

  
Growing up in South India

  
I could not overlook
what poverty did to our farmers

  
I was about  years old when one day

  
I saw a farmer in my village
sitting next to a farm stream

  
and eating something from the ground

  
Something did not seem right

  
I walked up to him
to see what was going on

  
I was shocked to see him eat mud

  
Mud

  
Brown soft mud from the stream

  
I was afraid he might die

  
I yelled at him

  
"What is this stupid mudeating business"

  
He looked at me helplessly and said

  
"I'm a farmer my crops failed;

  
my stomach doesn't know
that my pocket is empty"

  
I walked away quite helplessly

  
That night I shared this
with my grandfather

  
He was a remarkable man very clever

  
He was a part of the Indian
freedom struggle

  
under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi

  
Unlike me he wasn't surprised at all

  
He knew of people
who added rice starch to mud

  
to calm their hunger

  
And he told me something profound

  
If you see a person walking
on the road without footwear

  
it is important to understand
the root cause

  
that the person doesn't have enough money
to probably buy the footwear

  
I finished my college

  
started working with a big company

  
but that incident kept coming back to me

  
Why are smallholder farmers
in such abject poverty

  
What causes them to be so desperate

  
and why is it that
even in stcentury India

  
one farmer dies by suicide
every  minutes

  
My cofounders and I spent about six months
traveling across India

  
meeting hundreds of farmers
to listen to them

  
It became clear that climate risk
is the root cause

  
that causes farming to be
unpredictable and unviable

  
Farmers who make
reasonable money in one season

  
can fail miserably in the next

  
And farmers who could grow crops
earlier in summers

  
no longer get to grow crops in summers

  
Heat is so much more

  
The wells are drying up

  
every year there are new varieties
of pests and diseases

  
Farmers told us that this is all
because of because of God

  
I said "What"

  
"This is all because of God"

  
God is the one who caused it
God is the only one who can solve it

  
God in that context
I did not see as a sign of hope

  
I read it as a sign of helplessness

  
We heard from the farmers

  
They knew the problem

  
but they could not use
these two words "climate risk"

  
So we got together a team of engineers

  
scientists designers
from about six countries

  
to cocreate a solution with our farmers

  
which is quite unconventional

  
And the solution is “greenhouseinabox”

  
We call it "Kheyti Rakshak"

  
It’s a microgreenhouse

  
It's a beautiful greenhouse

  
which sits in a small portion
of the farmer's land

  
It's easy to build a small structure

  
covered with netting on all sides

  
which cuts off heat
prevents bugs and saves water

  
We can't cool the entire
planet in one day

  
but we definitely can create a climate
for a small portion of a farmer’s land

  
to be suitable for farming

  
From our first experiences
of growing vegetables 

  
staple vegetables like tomatoes
cabbage cucumbers 

  
we observed that greenhouses
can increase yields up to seven times

  
and use  percent less water

  
All this was too good to be true

  
All these things
are so difficult to happen

  
so farmers couldn't believe it
unless they actually saw it in action

  
So to make this happen

  
we had to have the courage
to reimagine agriculture 

  
reimagine agriculture
for smallholder farmers

  
After all this is not to grow tomatoes
in an industrial setting in Alaska

  
in winters

  
It is to grow tomatoes
for a smallholder farmer

  
by a smallholder farmer
in sizzling hot Indian summers

  
So this greenhouse had to be small enough
to fit in a portion of their land

  
easy enough for them to use

  
and cheap enough for them to buy

  
One of the biggest challenges
that we could overcome in the process

  
is financing

  
Thanks to our financing partners

  
today this greenhouse
is available with financing

  
which is fast enough and cheap enough

  
The greenhouse costs about  dollars

  
Farmers pay a down payment
of about  dollars

  
and the rest is financed through a loan

  
And this lifechanging asset

  
adds and extra  dollars of profit
on average to a household

  
month on month

  
This is a good double
of what they otherwise make

  
Marginal fiveten percent increases
in the incomes of smallholder farmers

  
cannot move the needle forward much

  
because the baseline is way too low

  
We need a significant
jump in their income

  
and that income has to be
reliable and dependable

  
To ensure that farmers succeed

  
we also provide quality seeds nutrition

  
training and advisory
leveraging mobile technology

  
We rolled out the solution
after quite a few tests with farmers

  
about three years ago

  
and we are marching towards
 farmers in this year

  
and looking at  farmers
over the next five years

  
Hopefully every smallholder
farmer in my lifetime

  
(Applause)

  
The best technologies in agriculture
can reach the smallest of the farmers

  
if we do two things well

  
listen to the farmer with curiosity
empathy and compassion

  
and keep smallholder farmers
particularly women farmers

  
at the center of the design

  
and build solutions

  
Then we can cocreate
mini solutions like Kheyti Rakshak

  
which bring dignity hope and stability
to the lives of the farmers

  
In this big fight against climate change

  
we all have to remember that we should
take our smallholder farmers along;

  
it is our collective responsibility

  
India is a home for about  million
smallholder farmers

  
I dream of a day

  
when "smallholder farmer" becomes
synonymous with a happy farmer

  
and being forced to eat mud
should never be a feature again anywhere

  
Thank you

  
(Applause and cheers)

  
Yuchi F’as@^

  
English Good afternoon

  
I come from the Yuchi
and Anishinaabe nations

  
My home is in Oklahoma

  
I have been a community organizer
for Indigenous rights

  
environmental justice and climate justice

  
for more than  years

  
I don't believe that I'm old enough
to do anything for that long

  
but here I am

  
(Applause)

  
I'm an Indigenous woman who lives
in the heart of oil and gas country

  
And what that means for me
is that I am in a constant state

  
of thinking about the environment
and climate change

  
And so I want to share
a few things that I know

  
and have learned
along the way in my work

  
One is

  
we cannot rely on those
who created the problem to fix it

  
(Applause)

  
Two we need to move with an urgency
that is not happening now

  
And three

  
we need leaders
who are experiencing the harm

  
to be the ones coming up
with the solutions

  
So it is clear that world leaders
are looking for solutions

  
to this climate crisis

  
but they are looking for them
through a lens of the economy

  
And so that means they are moving
with a casualness

  
that doesn't make it seem
like there's a real emergency

  
And they’re also being sold then
solutions that are basically bandaids

  
and not actual cures to the problem

  
They're being sold techno fixes
and market schemes

  
that really maintain business as usual

  
And instead

  
we need to be thinking
about what could be different

  
So I was recently at the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change COP

  
that just happened in Glasgow Scotland
just this past month

  
And it was apparent to me

  
that those who created the agenda
are also part of the problem

  
First of all

  
they created an admittance policy
that was really a policy of exclusion

  
for many grassroots communities
across the world

  
and especially those of the global south

  
That policy also ensured

  
that the largest badge delegation at COP
were fossil fuel lobbyists

  
Can you believe that

  
Actually I can

  
because this has been sort of the norm
at COP since its beginning

  
Which is why we need a shift

  
in who are the leaders
that they're listening to

  
And the shift in leadership
are coming up with the solutions

  
We need the knowledge and expertise
of those at the frontline

  
And by frontline

  
I mean those communities and peoples
who are experiencing climate change today

  
and some who have been experiencing
the harmful effects of climate change

  
for decades now

  
Those are the frontline leaders

  
that we need to be looking to
for their expertise

  
So I want you to imagine with me

  
if at that negotiating table at COP

  
if those who were dealing
with the actual harms today

  
were in that room
and negotiating the solutions

  
What if the people who have been
living sustainable lifestyles

  
and in relationship with the land

  
had been some of those folks
in the room making those decisions

  
What would it have been like

  
if grassroots leaders had been given
significant participation

  
in those negotiations

  
What would be different

  
Well first off

  
this global climate conference
would not have led with netzero

  
as the solution to this
climate crisis we're in

  
Netzero  not actually eliminating
greenhouse gas emissions 

  
but netzero being a sort of greenwashing
of business as usual

  
It basically means that you can
wash your hands of pollution

  
in one community

  
if you can afford to participate
in a few offset programs

  
So for example

  
you can invest in the continued existence
of a forest in South America

  
of Indigenous peoples in their lands
that should capture carbon

  
What it means then you are in theory

  
obligated from the harm
that you've caused a pollution

  
at a facility in another
lowincome community 

  
and very likely community of color 
in another part of the world

  
That's just wrong

  
And it just doesn't work

  
I mean I know people real people

  
I know their names and their families
on both ends of the spectrum

  
of the netzero spectrum

  
I know people who live at the fence line
of harmful oil refineries

  
who are polluting their communities

  
and I know the Indigenous people
who are farming the forests in Brazil

  
And neither of those communities
are benefiting from these programs

  
in ways that are building empowerment
for their communities

  
and building sustainability
for their communities

  
and they're often pressured
into these programs

  
with little or no choice

  
So I want to try to explain
netzero a little bit differently

  
in a way that might be
a little more tangible

  
If you think about it as kind of
like the net part of your paycheck

  
You get a job you negotiate a pay

  
and you feel really excited about that

  
But on that first day that first payday

  
you feel the crunch of it's a lot less
than you thought it was going to be

  
And it's the same with the netzero
emission targets right

  
It sounds good on the front end

  
but when it all comes out in the wash

  
it's much less than what
we need to have happen

  
to impact real significant
change right now

  
So what we need is a shift in leadership

  
We need leaders who are moving
with the urgency

  
that people are feeling harm
and hurt today

  
And we need leaders who are moving
with the values about community

  
and about the land
and the relationship with land

  
Those are the kind of leaders that we need
to have leading with the solutions

  
and the negotiations of addressing
this problem on a worldwide level

  
So that kind of leadership

  
if we just shifted those two things
about urgency and values

  
that would help all of us worldwide

  
Because what we need
is a set of leadership

  
that is going to do the work
that we need to have done

  
which is to move away from dirty
extractive harmful energy

  
to solutions that are local
communitybased communityheld

  
regenerative energy models

  
And they exist

  
They exist in communities
where people are saying

  
"Hey if the government
is not going to help us

  
we’re going to do
what we need to do right now”

  
And they are doing these projects
in their communities

  
So instead of investing
in a carbon capture project

  
that aims to put carbon
pollution into the ground

  
a technology that's not been
proven to really work

  
and still puts communities at harm

  
because it relies on the continued
existence and construction

  
of harmful pipelines that are dangerous

  
prone to leaks and even
explosions sometimes

  
And so 

  
But these community projects
are happening and they're having success

  
and I want to share a few with you

  
So in Richmond California 

  
between two cities

  
and next to a major Chevron oil refinery

  
that is spewing out greenhouse gases

  
and other toxic chemicals
into the neighborhood 

  
community leaders worked
with community organizations

  
like Asian Pacific Environmental Network

  
Rich City Rides Urban Tilth

  
and Communities for a Better Environment

  
And they took on Chevron
to hold them accountable and won

  
And won resources to build
a solar farm in their community

  
They also built a bike coop

  
to encourage young people
and others to bike in the city

  
and built community gardens

  
to grow healthy organic food
for themselves and schools

  
(Applause)

  
In rural Kentucky a community

  
a rural community who has long relied
on coal to fuel their community

  
they've been organizing with Kentuckians
for the Commonwealth

  
and also created a solar project

  
that is helping lowincome families
reduce their utility costs

  
and created thousands of jobs

  
In the Four Corners area of Arizona
Native Renewables

  
a womanled Navajo Hopi organization

  
is providing electricity
from solar to offgrid homes

  
A community that has long been harmed

  
by the devastating effects
of fossil fuel extraction

  
is now able to rely on an energy source
that is clean and Indigenousled

  
(Applause)

  
After hurricane Maria devastated
the islands of Puerto Rico

  
Organización Boricuá worked
with local farmers

  
to provide direct and immediate
support to those communities

  
by providing water shelter

  
health food

  
the weekly agro ecological
brigades and solidarity brigades

  
and they rebuilt homes
and rebuilt farming infrastructure

  
to make sure that they maintained
food sovereignty

  
In Brooklyn New York

  
in a highly industrial
neighborhood of Sunset Park

  
the community organization UPROSE

  
helped lead an effort
to create a solar farm

  
a first community solar coop
in the state of New York

  
It is an  square foot
rooftop solar garden

  
that again is providing
affordable energy to the neighborhood

  
and to small businesses as well

  
The fight against the Line  pipeline
in Minnesota and other states

  
has highlighted the amount of water
that those types of projects have used

  
And it's caused a threat
to the natural wild rice

  
that grows in the lakes there

  
And so community people
have worked to hold state

  
and federal agencies accountable
for water standards

  
in order to protect
their cultural preservation

  
and the wild rice

  
And in New Jersey
Ironbound Community Corporation

  
along with the New Jersey
Environmental Justice Alliance

  
has helped push legislation

  
that has enabled the state
to deny permits

  
any new permits to already
overburdened overpolluted neighborhoods

  
And it's set a standard
for other states to use

  
which has become a historic environmental
justice legislation for the country

  
These are the kinds of solutions
that we need to see happen

  
These are the kind of leadership
that we need to see happen

  
and we need these solutions happening
by the thousands nationwide

  
and even globally

  
Because these solutions
are not only attacking

  
the emissions at their source

  
but they're doing it by providing jobs

  
and wages and policies

  
that are addressing racism
and colonialism and economic inequity

  
This is the kind of leadership we need

  
We need this dramatic
shift to help us all

  
This dramatic shift in leadership

  
Just these two things

  
The urgency in which we move

  
and the values on which we move with

  
My grandmothers taught me
that we need to have care

  
responsibility and action
when it comes to our community

  
And those are the kind of leaders
that we need leading this fight

  
And if we are going to be serious
about addressing this climate crisis

  
here are the steps
that I need people to do

  
I need you to bring frontline leaders
into those negotiating spaces

  
Bring them in

  
Ask them what's happening
and the harms that are happening

  
Ask them what needs to be done

  
And listen hear them

  
And then invest and implement
in exactly what they said

  
in the exact ways they said to do it

  
because those changes are the changes

  
that are going to stop the problems
that we're having

  
and then stop the acceleration
of the climate crisis

  
And it's going to help slow down
the violence of the storms

  
and the sicknesses
that people are dealing with

  
with conditions like asthma and others

  
And it's going to stop you know

  
the continued drought and wildfires

  
Those are the solutions
that we need to have happen

  
And I need you all to help carry

  
not only the ask to shift that
for our communities

  
but also those values

  
So I ask you I invite you
to join me in this

  
and I challenge you to go out

  
and challenge our elected
leaders and others

  
And if they're not doing the right job

  
then tell them who the leaders are
that need to be there

  
We need frontline leaders
to be in the spaces

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Have you ever trodden
on a Lego brick in your bare feet

  
You’re tiptoeing through
your lounge late at night

  
and suddenly that stabbing pain

  
the expletives

  
and the inevitable question

  
“Why do we have so much of this stuff
all over the place”

  
Well that’s really quite simple

  
Your kids love playing with it

  
so you buy more

  
And a confession 

  
I love to watch my kids play with Lego

  
Especially good is when
I see them inventing their own rules

  
and their own worlds

  
So here are my daughters

  
last Saturday

  
making something out of different kits

  
and pieces of string

  
and pieces of wood and dolls
and other objects

  
And I asked them “What is it”

  
And they said to me “Dad of course
it’s a princess flying on a dragon

  
to visit farm animals in New York”

  
Of course what else could it be

  
Kids at play inspire me

  
They’re not afraid to ask “What if”

  
and “Why not”

  
But what kids implicitly know
that adults tend to forget

  
is that play isn’t just about fun

  
Now as a biologist I know that play
is spontaneous and pleasurable 

  
as you can see by the smiles
in this photograph 

  
but also it accelerates
and derisks learning

  
It helps kids to try out new behaviors

  
to refine those behaviors

  
and to imagine what is not

  
but what could be or what will be

  
As a business strategist
dealing with adults

  
I still recommend play

  
In fact play in business
is not just possible

  
I’d argue that it’s essential

  
and even urgent

  
And here’s why

  
Competitive advantage fades away
faster than any time in recent memory

  
In the s

  
if you had a performance edge
over your competitors

  
you could reasonably expect to continue
being a leader for around  years

  
on average

  
But now the halflife of that advantage
has shrunk to just one year

  
That means that shortlived success
is actually still very common

  
but sustained success  becomes very hard

  
and very rare

  
That means that actually reimagination
is the new execution

  
In order to stay on top

  
or even just to tread water
and stay still

  
you need to constantly
reimagine your business

  
But that’s not so simple

  
if you already have
a highly successful business model

  
We become prisoners of the mental models
that underpin our past success

  
In fact I found
in dealing with businesses

  
that you can’t really
stretch your strategy

  
unless you stretch your mind

  
Now play is of course a great way
of stretching your mind

  
Now 

  
I mean there’d be no mistake

  
I’m not suggesting literally

  
that executives huddle around
a conference table

  
with a big pile of Lego bricks 

  
although I’ve done that
and that works too

  
But instead I’ve created a series
of imagination games

  
to help executives
to stretch their thinking

  
Would you like to play with me

  
(Audience nods)

  
Good I'm glad you said that

  
OK so let’s supposing
that you’re stuck in the rut

  
of seeing the world through the lens
of your past and current success

  
I would recommend the “AntiCompany Game”

  
and here’s how it works

  
You get a piece of paper

  
you create a list of everything
which is essential to your strategy 

  
everything which underpinned
your past success

  
everything which is core and sacred 

  
and then you flip it

  
You create the exact
mirrorimage list of assumptions

  
and then you make the best
business case for this antiself

  
You’ll be surprised
at the ideas that it triggers

  
Supposing for example
that you’re the CEO of a hotel chain

  
and playing the game
and flipping the assumptions

  
Let’s assume that inconveniently

  
you don’t actually own any hotels

  
or any rooms

  
or even operate any hotels
or any rooms anywhere

  
Ridiculous 

  
quite possibly 

  
but actually how would you know
the difference between ridiculous

  
and the merely unfamiliar
untried and uncomfortable

  
And who’s to say

  
that something that seems impractical
can’t actually become and evolve

  
into a more powerful idea

  
Actually had the executives of hotels
played the “AntiCompany Game”

  
before 

  
they might have been able to foresee
the appearance of Airbnb

  
the hotelless hospitality company

  
and they might have been able
to stave off disruption

  
by preemptively disrupting themselves

  
Let’s play another game

  
“The Maverick Game”

  
On the edge of your industries 

  
on the edge of every industry 

  
are a population of maverick companies

  
that are taking a bet against
the incumbents’ business model

  
and their view of the future

  
Actually they have no choice

  
because to be a miniature version
of the incumbent would not be viable

  
Now it’s easy not to notice them 

  
many of them are small companies

  
It's easy to deliberately overlook
them with some justification

  
Many startups disappear fairly quickly
after being founded

  
And it’s very very tempting

  
given all of your experience
in the business

  
to judge them

  
Do they know what they’re doing

  
Does their business model make sense

  
Will they ever make any money

  
But instead of judging them
from the comfort

  
and the confidence of your position

  
try assuming that it’s they that have
the right bet on the future

  
Think about the consequences
of that for your business model

  
Try making the best case for their idea

  
Supposing for example

  
that you are the CEO of a company

  
that makes equipment
that makes semiconductors

  
Naturally you’d probably spend
most of your time and attention

  
on your main customer industry

  
the electronics industry

  
And if it so happened

  
that a couple of maverick
bioscience companies

  
were tinkering with your patents
and your technologies

  
you might overlook that
as a distraction

  
an irrelevance

  
But actually Brooks Automation

  
a leader in the field

  
decided to take a closeup look
at such a group of mavericks

  
to see whether it could learn anything

  
And what it realized

  
by looking at the world
through the eyes of these mavericks

  
was that actually the same techniques

  
and technologies which can be used
to handle delicate semiconductors

  
can also be applied to other fragile
and easily contaminated materials

  
like biological samples

  
And puzzling on the significance of this

  
they reimagined how to handle
and store and transport

  
and label and identify biological samples

  
In fact they became a successful pioneer

  
in the new industry
of automated biobanking

  
So successful in fact
that just a couple of days ago

  
they announced that this was now
their core business moving forwards

  
It’s only by focusing
on these anomalous mavericks

  
that they could see their own path
to renewed success and growth

  
Now not everything in business
goes according to plan

  
In fact sometimes the plans
go horribly awry

  
But you know what

  
That can be a source of inspiration too

  
To find out how

  
let’s play the “PreMortem Game”

  
So your role in this game is to write 

  
the obituary for your company

  
which is going to fail
with  percent certainty

  
in five years’ time

  
What is the cause of death

  
What will have been the point of failure

  
Why will it have failed

  
How will it have failed

  
The challenge here is that it’s easy
to be seduced into the baseline fallacy

  
The baseline fallacy is the idea

  
that it’s the current business model
which is the lowrisk bet

  
And of course that tends to be true

  
until it isn’t true

  
at which point it’s probably too late
to do anything about it

  
Now your employees
are an earlywarning indicator

  
They will have intuitions
if the model begins to slip

  
but it’s very hard for them to speak up

  
And it’s even taboo for them to speak up

  
when the business model is under pressure

  
But when executives create playgrounds 

  
spaces for the safe exploration
of alternatives

  
and alternative scenarios 

  
then you get to tap into your employees’
considerable experience

  
about the vulnerabilities

  
and the weak spots

  
and the blind spots of your company

  
Does anyone remember visiting recently
one of these gorgeous marble palaces

  
No

  
It’s probably been a while since
we visited the local banking branch

  
Had bricksandmortar banks
played the “PreMortem Game”

  
perhaps they would have heard
their employees expressing some concerns

  
about the gradually dwindling
flow of customers to local branches

  
And perhaps they would have been
slightly less taken by surprise

  
when companies like NewBank

  
a digital native

  
seized very rapidly indeed
on that opportunity

  
to convince to date
more than  million Latin Americans

  
that inperson transactions
in real buildings

  
were a quaint but obsolete
relic of the past

  
It’s only when you bring
your vulnerabilities into full view

  
in this way

  
that you may be motivated
to reimagine your business

  
and to do so in a robust manner

  
It’s why the Roman Catholic Church
invented the role

  
the position of the Devil’s advocate
in the th century

  
to test the future consequences
of its decisions to appoint new saints

  
They did that by imagining

  
what would Satan say

  
or propose

  
or counterpropose

  
in addition to the normal procedure
of thinking about the big man upstairs

  
Now any human being
any employee any team

  
and therefore any company
can harness human imagination

  
It’s a defining trait of our species

  
Failures to imagine in business
are really failures of leadership

  
Business is a serious matter
but it should not exclude play

  
When leaders embrace play
and imagination games

  
they can unlock the imagination
of their employees

  
uncover disruptive new strategies

  
and renew their lease on the future

  
Thank you

  
(Applause)

  
Imagine a world in which China
was an environmental leader

  
That would be a more
hopeful world wouldn't it

  
When we hear about China

  
we usually hear about human rights
trade disputes toxic pollution

  
And I'm not here to dispute the news

  
Instead what I want to do

  
is share with you evidence
based on personal experience

  
of where China is leading

  
ClientEarth the environmental law
organization that I set up

  
has a person office in Beijing

  
We work as trusted partners
with the Ministry of Environment

  
We train judges and we train prosecutors
in environmental prosecutions

  
Let me share with you how this all began

  
In 

  
I was invited to Brussels to meet
a group of Chinese officials

  
They said they wanted to meet CEOs
of Western environmental groups

  
because they were looking to encourage
more environmental groups in China

  
Shortly after that
I was invited to Beijing

  
by the Supreme People's Court
the highest court in the land

  
The judges were working
on regulations for a new law

  
that would allow
Chinese environmental NGOs

  
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
They were interested in my advice

  
because of my extensive
environmental litigation experience

  
in Europe and in America

  
They wanted to know they said

  
what it would take to really make
such a system work

  
I found myself
in a conference room in Beijing

  
with three justices of the Supreme Court

  
and senior officials
of the Ministry of Environment

  
and the People's Congress
which is the Chinese parliament

  
"Before we get into details" I said
"I want to compliment you

  
It is amazing that you are writing a law

  
to allow Chinese environmental groups
to sue polluting companies

  
including those owned by the state

  
This is revolutionary"

  
(Laughter)

  
The senior judge said "Mr Thornton
'revolutionary' is a big word for us"

  
(Laughter)

  
So we laughed

  
And in that human moment
I realized I could work with these people

  
He said "Consider it a sea change"

  
So for the next three months or so

  
my team and I worked
very closely with the judges

  
designing recommendations
for how to make the system really deliver

  
for citizens enforcing the law

  
One of the key provisions
we worked on involved costs

  
Now it costs money to bring
environmental litigation

  
and what really kills you is

  
if when you lose you have to pay
the other side's costs

  
as you do in the UK

  
We said this was only going to work
for the Chinese environmental groups

  
if when they won a case

  
they had all of their costs
paid by the polluters

  
but when they lost they would not
have to pay any of the polluters’ costs

  
Because win or lose

  
they were asserting the interests
of the public at large

  
Three months after that I found myself
back in a meeting in Beijing;

  
this time in the Supreme Court building
just off Tiananmen Square

  
I was there with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
We were sitting at a white marble table
that seemed to be  feet long

  
Across from us were three
Supreme Court judges

  
A senior judge began the meeting

  
by saying that they had accepted
almost all of our recommendations

  
including the key recommendation on costs

  
So at one stroke

  
the Chinese system became friendlier
to citizen environmental groups

  
trying to enforce the law

  
than many countries

  
The senior judge then said
"What do you want to do next for China"

  
Now on my prior trip

  
I had learned that the Chinese
had just appointed

  
 environment court judges

  
Now environment judges specialists
are rare around the world

  
In Europe for example
there's just a handful in Scandinavia

  
Their idea was that by appointing
all of these specialist judges

  
they would hear a vast volume of cases

  
and raise the quality of the rule of law
for the environment in China quickly

  
"So" I said "you might want
to train those judges"

  
They then asked us to train the judges

  
But I had never trained
a judge in my life

  
So I said “Where shall we start”

  
"With us" he said

  
"With the Supreme Court"

  
"Yes"

  
"But what do you want to learn"

  
"Well" he said "we want you to come back

  
and give us a seminar
on climate litigation

  
because you're an expert in that"

  
I said "Gladly but what's the thought
behind your request"

  
And he said

  
“We want to know the best
climate change cases in the world

  
because we want to decide
some of the best climate change cases

  
here in China"

  
Now I can assure you that I had never
had such a conversation

  
with the Supreme Court in Washington 

  
(Laughter)

  
or even London or Paris

  
Certainly nowhere other than Beijing

  
So we teamed up with the head
of the EUChina Environment Programme

  
to create a ClientEarth office in Beijing

  
He then organized this training seminar
for the Supreme Court

  
where we discussed trends
in climate litigation around the world

  
He then organized training sessions

  
for all of those specialist
environment court judges

  
Now more such judges have been
appointed in the meantime

  
and as of today

  
we've trained more than 
of these judges

  
(Applause)

  
About a year after we started
training the judges

  
a prosecutor came to our office and said

  
"In that law that you helped write

  
we the prosecutors got the right to sue
the Chinese government

  
on behalf of the people
for environmental matters

  
and we've never had the right
to sue the government before"

  
ClientEarth on the other hand
sues governments all the time

  
(Laughter)

  
So they were asking us
to share with them

  
our experience of suing governments

  
This was the Chinese federal prosecutors
asking us to train them

  
to sue the Chinese government

  
(Laughter)

  
It is the most amazing request
I've ever had

  
(Laughter)

  
So of course we started
working with them

  
We've now trained over  prosecutors
in how to bring environmental cases

  
(Applause)

  
A few months ago (Laughs)

  
we got a letter handdelivered

  
from the prosecutors
to our Beijing office

  
Now what I'm told
by my friends in Beijing

  
ordinarily the last thing
in life you want to get

  
is a letter from the prosecutors

  
This however was a thankyou note

  
and what it said was "Thank you
for your cooperation with us

  
As a result of cooperating with you

  
we have brought in  alone

  
over  environmental cases"

  
Audience Whoa

  
(Applause)

  
 cases and the majority
of those cases

  
were brought against
government departments

  
Now the prosecutors have set up bureaus
all over the country

  
to keep pushing out this level of cases

  
to raise compliance standards
throughout the country

  
Now if this isn't a revolution
it's certainly a sea change

  
(Laughter)

  
Now whenever I talk about China
I'm always asked about coal

  
China burns more coal
than any other country

  
We're working on that

  
Following the money
we've been working for some years

  
with the largest banks
and financial institutions in China

  
The argument we've been making

  
is that coal is simply a bad
investment for them to make

  
Recently we had
a twoday seminar in Beijing

  
for these institutions

  
and it was very heartening to see

  
that that argument
that coal is a bad investment

  
has now been internalized
by these institutions

  
and taken into their own thinking

  
When it comes to enforcement

  
the prosecutors have a new
fantastic opportunity

  
Recently a government audit

  
found that many of the new
coalfired power stations

  
authorized in recent times in China

  
were authorized illegally
by provincial officials

  
who wanted to boost their balance sheet

  
Because these were illegally authorized

  
they are a perfect enforcement target

  
Now another major problem
is all of the coalfired power stations

  
that Chinese companies
have been planning to build

  
outside China in Belt and Road
development countries

  
So we've been working
alongside many others

  
with the Ministry of Environment

  
to try and figure out how you stop
all of those coalfired power stations

  
in the pipeline

  
And what is wonderful news
is that in September 

  
President Xi Jinping
at the UN General Assembly

  
announced that China
would not fund or build

  
any more coalfired
power stations outside China

  
(Applause)

  
We also have reason to believe 
and good reason I think 

  
that China’s own emissions
will hit their peaking plateau soon

  
and then will seriously
decline before 

  
Now does more need to be done in China

  
Certainly  a lot more and faster

  
just like in every other country

  
But what I've found heartening

  
are all of these changes to the system
that they've been making in recent years

  
All of these environment court judges

  
the tens of thousands of cases

  
many of them against
government departments;

  
the Ministry of Environment
getting enhanced powers;

  
the largest banks
and financial institutions

  
realizing that coal is a bad investment;

  
the president promising
no more coal outside China

  
We work in many countries
around the world

  
but I have never seen
the intense focus on systemic change

  
moving a country towards
environmental improvements

  
as I've seen in China

  
I'd like to think that I have
given you reasons for hope

  
China has certainly given me hope

  
Thank you

  
(Cheers and applause)

  
I’d like to dedicate this talk
to my three children

  
Phi Mack

  
and Ella Roberta

  
(Inhales)

  
If I stop breathing for two minutes

  
I would die

  
It is the simplest thing
that all of us do unconsciously

  
about  times a day

  
So normal

  
that we forget that breathing
is the essence of life

  
My daughter Ella Roberta

  
stopped breathing frequently

  
and was resuscitated
numerous times by me at home

  
and in hospital by her doctors

  
until suddenly on the th of February

  
three weeks after her ninth birthday

  
she took her final breath

  
Ella was a healthy clever
sporty and funny girl

  
She had a lot of musical ability

  
At the time of her passing

  
she already played a dozen instruments

  
She was exceptionally good at football

  
cycling skating swimming and dancing

  
Ella was a great writer

  
and she was also pretty good at art

  
At the time of her passing

  
she had a reading age of  years

  
When she was six

  
the simple act of breathing
became the biggest challenge of her life

  
I rushed Ella to hospital
 times in  months

  
when she suddenly began suffering
severe respiratory issues

  
She was diagnosed
with lifethreatening asthma

  
at the age of seven

  
She was admitted
into intensive care five times

  
and put in an induced coma
to save her life

  
when her lungs gave up on her

  
It wasn't until after
the first coroner's inquest

  
in September 

  
that I learned that her possible trigger
of her sudden illness

  
was to do with "something in the air"

  
But at that time
we did not know what it was

  
Ella had one of the worst
cases ever of asthma

  
recorded in the United Kingdom

  
according to the pathologist
who carried out her postmortem

  
We as a family we live  meters
from the South Circular

  
in southeast London

  
It is one of the busiest roads in the UK

  
I later learned that air
pollution around our home

  
was persistently far above the levels
deemed acceptable by the WHO

  
On every walk to school every bike ride

  
every time Ella went outside

  
her body was absorbing
invisible toxic air

  
spewed out by petrol and diesel vehicles

  
A second inquest into Ella’s death
just in December 

  
the coroner Philip Barlow

  
he concluded that it was the excessive
illegal levels of air pollution

  
not only inducted her asthma

  
but it was the highest ever
on the night she died

  
As a result of this

  
Ella is the first person in the world

  
to have air pollution
listed as a cause of death

  
on her death certificate

  
Ella's story is unique I admit

  
but her experience is shockingly ordinary

  
In too many countries around the world

  
air pollution exceeds

  
what the WHO tells us
is acceptable to breathe

  
Fossil fuels everyone
they're killing us

  
Almost one in five premature deaths

  
are linked to air pollution

  
from combustion engines
coal power plants

  
wood burning ammonia cooking stoves

  
and other fossil fuels

  
That is  million people a year
dying from heart attacks cancer strokes

  
dementia suicide depression
stillbirths and miscarriages

  
And that's just the start

  
Children are the worst affected
due to their lungs still developing

  
Air pollution stunts the development
of lungs and brains

  
Scientists believe it
are finding soot in mothers placentas

  
meaning unborn babies
are directly exposed to the black carbon

  
produced by motor traffic
and fuel burning

  
Like Ella  percent of children
around the world

  
are breathing unsafe air

  
The real tragedy of this is we know
how to solve this public health crisis

  
We need to shift from toxic fossil fuels

  
to clean electrified public
and active transport

  
The second inquest into Ella’s death
made it abundantly clear

  
Ella would still be here alive today

  
if air pollution around our home

  
had been within the WHO acceptable limits

  
Air pollution is an invisible
global pandemic

  
It's a silent killer

  
You know what
unless you clean up the air

  
you will never resolve climate change

  
Do you know why

  
It's linked to global warming

  
acid rain

  
effects on wildlife

  
depletion of the ozone layer

  
But for me this is personal

  
Eight years after Ella's death

  
I still visit respiratory doctors
with Ella’s siblings

  
who continue to be impacted
by excessive air pollution

  
As my children and I share a genetic link

  
we are equally susceptible
to air pollution

  
The WHO recently
strengthened its guidelines

  
and the evidence shows us
there is no such thing as safe levels

  
Every country in the world

  
must enshrine these new
WHO guidelines into law now

  
I'm putting them on notice

  
(Applause)

  
What do I want

  
I'll tell you what I want

  
I want every government
to guarantee their children

  
the chance to live full and healthy lives

  
To be able to fully and safely breathe

  
Breathing clean air
is every child's human right

  
Governments have a duty of care
to protect their citizens

  
Remember  million people
in the world have asthma

  
including me

  
(Breathing through inhaler)

  
The fight to breathe clean air is real

  
When I say "Breathe life"

  
what do you say

  
You say "Clean air is our right!"

  
Breathe life!

  
Audience Clean air is our right!

  
RAKD Thank you for listening

  
Thank you very much

  
(Applause and cheers)
